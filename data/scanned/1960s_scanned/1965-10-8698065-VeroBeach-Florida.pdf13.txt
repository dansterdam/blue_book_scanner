October 26, 1965

The Langley Research Center is conducting a research program i.e. for launching balloons. The manufacturer of these balloons is the G. T. Schjeldahl Company, Northfield, Minn. A series of six of these balloons are being launched on the current tests.

The balloon is shaped like a blim 13.7 to 16.3 feet long about 4 feet in diameter. It has a film off the tail which is also inflated. It is made of metallized mylar plastic. 

One was launched October 19, two were launched October 20, and the others in the series may be launched today.

One of these balloons launched last week landed inland about 25 miles (air miles) from Wellfleet Island and generated a flurry of public interest. 

The Air Force Office at the Pentagon called this morning and they had been interrogated about a balloon launched on Paso Beach, Florida, and exploded. They wondered if it might have been launched at Wellflops. The project people here feel that persons finding balloons could, if they want to find out where they came from, write the serial number and the Design Release number on the balloon.
