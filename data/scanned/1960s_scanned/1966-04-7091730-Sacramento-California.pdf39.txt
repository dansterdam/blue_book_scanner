Hayden Calls Saucer "Idio" 10% Percent "Hoax"

THE GUY WHO TAUGHT SPACE MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAID 75% OF THE SAUCEBS REPORTED MAY BE REAL - THE REST ARE HOAXES, MASS PSYCHOSES OR UNUSUAL PHENOMENA.

DR. JOSEPH M. DALDY, INS'TRUCrO11 HI SPACE MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNl.4., SAID UFO PJiENOMENA COULD BE DIVIDED INTO THREE CATEGORIES:
1. GENUINE SAUCERS - ABOUT 75% OF TOTAL SIGHTINGS MIGHT BE IN THIS CATEGORY.
2. HOAXES - ABOUT 10% OF TOTAL SIGHTINGS MIGHT BE HOAXES, OR DELIBERATE FAKES.
3. MASS PSYCHOSES OR UNUSUAL PHENOMENA -  ABOUT 15% Of' TOTAL SIGHTINGS MIGHT BE IN THIS CATEGORY.

DALDY SAID SIGHTLNGS THAT COULD BE TRACED TO FALSE DATA, HALLUCINATIONS, MISINTERPRETATIONS OR OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE LAST TWO GROUPS. HIS ESTIMATES WERE BASED ON CAREFUL S'TUDY OF ALL AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC DATA ON UFO PHENOMENA.

SOME "EXPERTS" HAVE SAID THAT 90% 012 ALL UFO SIGHTINGS ARE HOAXES. HOWEVER, DR. DALDY, WHO HAS STUDIED THE SUBJECT FOR YEARS, BELIEVES THAT ONLY ABOUT 10% OF SIGHTINGS COULD BE PLACED IN THIS CATEGORY.
