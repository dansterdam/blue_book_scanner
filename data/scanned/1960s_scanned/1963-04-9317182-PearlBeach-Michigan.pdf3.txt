Output of the text in the document:

Outgoing 1943-4-9 subject: 00:32-123 letter. The purpose of the letter is to inform the correspondent that the writer has observed a strange aerial phenomenon and is reporting it.

On 30 April at 1930 EDT, the writer and two friends were in the area of a small lake when they observed a very large luminous object hovering around it. The object was looking down at them, and at the same time trying to make a noise. The writer's friend went over to try to get a closer look, but the object then moved away rapidly. Within a second it had disappeared. A short time later, the object reappeared in a different location, then disappeared again. The writer is not certain what the object was, but believes it may have been some kind of unusual aircraft. The writer requests that the correspondent treat this report confidentially.

Sincerely yours,
