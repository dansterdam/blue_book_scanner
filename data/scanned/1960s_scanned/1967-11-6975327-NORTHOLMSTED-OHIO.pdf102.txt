Gentlemen:

On November 11, 1969, while on a visit to Mexico, I took some pictures of unidentified objects in the sky. They were being seen by others as well. The objects appeared to be in a fixed position and seemed to be watching us. They were a different size and shape and moved in a different manner than the small, hazy objects that one sees as a distant airplane, etc. 

Since there was considerable traffic with the crowds on the avenues, it was difficult to get a good look at the objects for any length of time. However, on Sunday night, around 7:30, the objects were visible again and I was able to take two pictures, which I am enclosing herewith for your consideration.

I note that each exposure shows on the negatives, as from the camera I used, two strange looking objects. However, I believe the pictures do not actually portray what I saw with the naked eye, as the strange objects appeared much larger and more distinct when viewed directly.

This variation, it should be noted, is not one of those cases where the objects were photographed through a haze or other atmospheric interference. The night was clear and the objects were seen directly in the sky.

I hope these pictures will be of interest to you and I shall be glad to furnish any additional information you may desire. Please let me know your findings and conclusions.

Yours truly,
