SUBJECT: FRIEND/W/69216
UFO SIGHTING (AKRON, OHIO, 21 JANUARY 1961)

1. During March 1961, your office forwarded a tape recording to ATIC which was received from a citizen of Akron, Ohio, concerning the subject of unidentified flying objects. The tape contained information indicating the object seen in Akron, Ohio, which occurred 21 January 1961. This tape was apparently forwarded to the President of the United States and also to several members of the United States Congress. The recording which was forwarded to ATIC was turned over to this office on 14 March 1961.

2. On 8 February 1961 ATIC was instructed by AFCIN to Akron for the purpose of investigating the 21 January 1961 UFO sighting. The date was selected by the investigators as being the most suitable due to atmospheric refraction.

3. The investigation revealed the following: Whose accounts of the sighting is on the tape were recorded. The sighting for Mr. and Mrs. ------ occurred around midnight on 21 January 1961. Mr. ----- and Mr. ---- were also eyewitnesses and their accounts were recorded. The information they provided appears to be consistent; the objects being sighted between 2230 and 2300, appearing as a single light or possibly multiple lights, and as large as a 50 cent piece in the sky, moving slowly with the top cut off and approximately five times the size of a star.

4. On 21 January 1961 at 2258 the weather at the Akron-Canton Airport was a 7000 foot overcast, the visibility was 7 miles, and the temperature was 17 degrees. The witnesses stated that a haze or cloud cover was present which may have distorted the sighting in some manner. The visibility conditions indicate the possibility of inversions or stable conditions (inversion). Inversions increase the range of visibility.

5. On 21 January 1961 official comment at Akron was 30%. This time, observers at Akron were cognizant of the fact that UFO photographs/conditions of the atmosphere were associated with temperature inversions. Preliminary photographic analysis indicates the possibility of evidence of temperature inversion.
