I first noticed the description following a USAF tracking station observation at 0545 hours on 9-5-62. I observed the very white light at about 30 degrees elevation and moving rapidly north to south. After approximately 15 minutes, this very bright light suddenly stopped and hovered for a short period. Then it turned in a northeast direction and accelerated very rapidly and disappeared from view. I have found no satisfactory explanation for the incident.
