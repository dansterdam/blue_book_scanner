35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MORE THAN A MILE AWAY. IT WAS FLYING ERRATIC AND EMITTING A PULSATING RED LIGHT WHICH I FELT IT DID THIS CLOSER THAN WHAT IT DID AT FIRST. I THOUGHT IT WAS MAYBE A PLANE AT FIRST BUT IT DIDN'T MANEUVER LIKE A PLANE AND THE RED LIGHT SEEMED PECULIAR. I STOOD AND WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.
