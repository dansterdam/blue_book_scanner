Dear Miss _____________,

Major Quintanilla has forwarded to me some correspondence relative to your report of August 5 and 6, 1965 including a copy of his letter to you of February 24, 1966. I want to compliment you on the form and detail of report. You put to shame some professional investigators.

I was going to put in a call to you or to Dr. and Mrs. _____________, but I am wired up now, but not for sound. I was in the event that I would wish to have some points cleared up, I find that your report was so full and complete that I see no need for any further call.

The importance of your report is particularly in its relation to other reports that came in to the Air Force on sightings made on the night of August 3-4, 1965. It appears that yours was one of the more complete and detailed ones. There is a growing suspicion that something of great many kinds and together. It is entirely possible that something of tremendous significance happened during those hours that night and we have only incomplete reports to indicate what may have occurred.

I am as anxious as I am to solve this mystery. I can assure you that I will give the particular problem my personal attention, as I am interested in it greatly.

I was particularly pleased to find that your report contained a very complete sequence plot of attitudes and azimuths, and close passages to stars. Perhaps you can still do this from memory. The data going to visit in Valentine Nebraska is still on my mind and I might ask a few questions as a further check.

I assume that objects A, B and C were concurrently visible for a portion of the night of August 3-4 and that only object B was visible on the night of August 3-4. Is this correct?
