The text extracted from the document is as follows:

"34. Date you completed this questionnalre: 25 june 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting UFO. 

The night of the sighting it was raining and thunderstorming and I was driving my car to Vineland, N.J. on route 47. I first noticed the object as a bright light and at first I thought it might be a helicopter, but as I got closer I realized that it was much larger than a helicopter and was floating and gliding across the sky very fast and very low, about tree top level. The object did not have any running lights and made no sound at all. I watched it for over a minute as it glided across the sky and then it seemed to disappear into the clouds. I cannot say whether or not it went straight up or just disappeared. I was quite upset by the sighting as I had never seen anything like this before and I still do not know what it was. I just hope that this information in of some use to you. I am willing to cooperate further if you need any other information."
