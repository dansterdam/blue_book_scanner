11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched an oval shaped red-orange glowing object which appeared to be hovering above the area, and appeared to be observed from a distance. The object appeared to have a lighter center and to be lit up. The observers felt that the object should again be visible, they could not locate it. A visual check of the area by the investigators revealed a dirt road which follows the valley floor and runs parallel to the Honda Ridge Road. It appears the observers observed a ground light and that the glow was reflecting off the dirt road into the hills.
