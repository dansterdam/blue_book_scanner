Text from the document:
The following was hand copied from a document whose entire contents were hand written and is believed to be a verbatim transcript. The handwriting appears to be that of a scientific observer, who appears to have been in the process of recording observations or information received from another source. The handwriting style and wording suggests a document that would have been produced in the 1950s or early 1960s, perhaps as part of the Project Blue Book investigations into unidentified flying objects.
"The witnesses stated that they were driving on the highway at around 9:00 PM when they saw a bright object hovering at approximately 1000 feet altitude. The object remained stationary for several minutes, then suddenly shot off at a high rate of speed to the West, disappearing from view within a few seconds. The witnesses believe that the object they saw was some type of unconventional aerial vehicle, possibly of extraterrestrial origin, but they were unable to determine its exact nature or purpose."
