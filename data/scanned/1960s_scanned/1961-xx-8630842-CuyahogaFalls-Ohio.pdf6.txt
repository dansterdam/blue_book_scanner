Dear Major Coleman:

On 19 June 1961, at your request, I sent you information regarding a sighting of unidentified flying objects in January 1961. I would appreciate knowing, in accordance with AFR 200-2, association of this sighting with any official study and/or findings.

Would you please send me a copy of the latest DOD News Release on the subject?

On 7 August 1961, I requested information regarding two Chicago-area sightings on 30 July 1961. As I have not received a reply, I would appreciate having the opportunity to obtain this information, if available.

On 11 September 1961, I requested information regarding a sighting on 21 August 1961 over Columbus, Ohio. As I have not received a reply, I would appreciate having the opportunity to obtain this information, if available. 

Major, I have a considerable amount of patience and feel you are meeting my requests in good faith. I would, however, request you acknowledge this and other requests soon, thereby insuring that both these characteristics will remain unchanged.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
Director
