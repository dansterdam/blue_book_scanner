FLYING GAUGE REVIEW 
JAN-FEB 66

Flashing lights and Aerial Shocks
This report comes to us from the 1965 Nevada sightings of September 22, in which a group of people, including a Mexican-American pilot of Mexican Airways, saw the same UFO over Carson City and photographed the object, which was later analyzed by the Nevada Air National Guard and Project Blue Book officials.

According to the report, several people, including a pilot of Mexican Airways, saw the same UFO over Carson City, Nevada on the previous evening, the 21st. The object was photographed, and the pictures are presently being analyzed by the Nevada Air National Guard and Project Blue Book officials.

Emilio Riva Palacio, Jr. and other officials, were at a private citizens' home when the light and power failure occurred. After the light failure, they saw the object hovering and then suddenly disappear. From this object it lit up the valley around Glenbrook.

Shortly afterwards, Guillermo Manzano, a pilot of Mexican Airways, saw the same UFO of light configuration, as did several others in the area. An attempt was made to approach the object, but it caused the aircraft to suffer a series of electric shocks and forced it to return to its base without further incident.
