There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from what appears to be an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a form with various fields that seem to be used for reporting UFO sightings, including information about the sky conditions, the sighting, and the observer. The form has been partially filled out by hand, but there is no image or photograph included.
