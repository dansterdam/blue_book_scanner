Text from the document:

We would both appreciate it very much if you would help us wherever possible. Unfortunately, the problem is a very delicate one and there are many people involved. Anything you can do along this line would be very much appreciated. We appreciate the problems the Air Force must have with a lot of irresponsible reports on this subject, and we want you to know that we fully understand your position. Thanks very much for your interest. Sincerely,

Edward J. Ruppelt
