INTERVIEW WITH Mr. __________

I received a call from Mr. ________ on November 6, 1967 informing me that he had observed an unidentified flying object on October 26, 1967.

According to Mr. __________, the object was first observed at approximately 1:30 a.m. on October 26, 1967. He said he was awakened by a bright light outside his bedroom window and upon looking outside, he observed a bright, circular object hovering approximately 50 feet above the ground. He stated the object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and was giving off a bright, white light.

Mr. ________ said the object hovered in one spot for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, then suddenly shot straight up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

He stated he did not hear any sound associated with the object while it was present. Mr. ________ said he has no explanation for what he observed, and that he has never seen anything like it before.
