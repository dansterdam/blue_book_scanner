REPORT ABOUT A SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

On 6 August 1966, at approximately 8:15 PM, the witness, Mr. Donnybrook, reported observing an unidentified flying object over his farm near Donnybrook, North Dakota.

According to the witness, the object was silver in color and approximately 20-30 feet in diameter. It hovered over his field at an altitude of approximately 50-100 feet for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

The witness stated that the object made no sound and did not emit any exhaust or light. He reported feeling startled and somewhat frightened by the experience.

The Air Force investigated the incident and concluded that the object was likely a conventional aircraft, despite the witness's description. No further evidence or explanation was provided in the report.
