Called Cox Municipal FAA. They reported that they had no records of the Goodyear blimp being in town on the 16 of June. Suggested that I call Patterson FAA since Patterson sometimes controls the blimp. At 0845 called Patterson FAA and was informed that the information was not available and that they could not tell me. They suggested that I call Cox.
