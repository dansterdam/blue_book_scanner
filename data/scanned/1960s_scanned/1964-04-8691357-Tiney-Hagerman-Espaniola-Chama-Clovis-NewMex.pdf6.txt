INCOMING 
MINDAUSAS V. MIKLOLAINIS, ACTING INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 474TH 
TACTICAL FIGHTER WING.

COMMENTS: OBSERVER INSIST SHE SAW OBJECT AT 2342 AND
CALLED CANNON COMMAND POST TEN MINUTES LATER. CANNON CP. HAS
ALREADY LOGGED AT 2432Z. IF CALL WAS PROPERLY LOGGED, AS THE
OFFICER BELIEVES, HER OBSERVATION COULD HAVE COINCIDED WITH THOSE
MENTIONED IN PARA H THIS MSG. FAA CONTROL, ALBUQUERQUE DID NOT
GIVE SIZE OF SIGHTINGS REPORTED, SO THERE IS NO WAY TO CORRELATE
THIS INFORMATION. HOWEVER, SINCE CONTINENTAL NR 33 ESTIMATED OBJECT
TO BE AT FLT LEVEL 25C, OBJECT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN VERY CLOSE TO
OBSERVER AS SHE CLAIMED. ONLY POSSIBLE CAUSE OF OBJECT IS
ESTIMATED TO :-AVE BEEN A METEOROLOGICAL OR ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMI-
NON SUCH AS A METEOR.
