Aprile 20, 1969

The missile was seen about 9:00 p.m. on the evening of April 19, 1969. It was a clear sky, with a bright moon. The object was first seen in the northwest and travelled in a southeast direction, finally disappearing in the southeast. The missile made no sound and was observed for about 10 minutes.

The witness was Mr. E. G. Brock, a retired colonel in the U.S. Air Force. He is a highly reputable and reliable person. The object appeared to be approximately 5 to 10 miles away and at an estimated altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The object was described as a luminous, bright object that appeared to pulsate or flicker at times. It left no trail and did not appear to be an aircraft or conventional missile.
