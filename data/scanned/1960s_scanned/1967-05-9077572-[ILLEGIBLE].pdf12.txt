UFO Photograph, May 19, 1967

1. Reference your photograph of an unidentified flying object which you forwarded to the Aerial Phenomena Office for analysis. Your photograph is returned by photo negative as V-light-pattern.

2. The photograph which you submitted appears to be genuine as far as a negative is concerned. There is no indication of double exposure or re-touching on either the negative or the resultant paper print. The conclusion is therefore that the object sighted in the photograph appears to be real. Detailed analysis, however, is impossible. Although no definite confirmation could be discerned as to the identity, the possibility that the object is a result of a natural phenomenon cannot be ruled out.

3. No further analysis can be made since you did not observe an object during daylight and your camera did not register an image. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
