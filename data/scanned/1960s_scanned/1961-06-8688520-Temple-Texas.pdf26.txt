The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with various questions and space for handwritten responses.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path of the object's "A" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or one's length to line with a known object and determine how much of the object is covered by the hand of the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match branch?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words any common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw.

It looks like a detailed questionnaire or report form related to a UFO sighting.
