The image contains two photographs. The larger photograph on the left depicts a silhouette of a person standing on a road surrounded by a hilly landscape. The smaller photograph on the right shows a similar landscape, but with the person standing at a greater distance from the viewer, resulting in the person appearing smaller in the frame.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE A "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN IT WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "O" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE PHENOMENON LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "O" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "O" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. FOR EXAMPLE, HOW CLOSELY THE LARGER SKETCH.
