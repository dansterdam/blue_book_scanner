[Handwritten text]
I sighted a silver colored APR C 19:40 22 Oct 62. The object was first observed in the northeast moving in a northerly direction. It appeared to be elongated in shape and was flying at a high altitude. It would appear and disappear and then reappear again at another location continuing on a northerly course. The object would reappear across the sky and the course it was taking appeared to be erratic. At times it appeared stationary, then would move rapidly, again appearing to be stationary. This continued for approximately 30 minutes. After this time, the object disappeared completely and was not observed again. The object appeared to be silver in color and was not seen to make any sound. No other objects were observed in the vicinity at the time.
