AIRRAFT

Memo for the Record:

Letter was sent to the witness to clarify several points in his sighting. Witness confirms that the sighting involved only 27 June 1967, and that on that date he had put down the date as June 27, 1967. His information revealed that only 27 June 1967 was involved and he also helped to clarify the actual direction in which the object was seen.

It is interesting to note that the Wilkes-Barre - Scranton Airport control tower chief, at the time of the sighting, no activity was responsible for the sighting. Determination clearly shows that no air traffic activity could have accounted for the sighting.
