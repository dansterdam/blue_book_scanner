Hynek Swamps It 
To Study UFO's 
Following Report

Trudging through swamps in southern Michigan may not be 
the ideal spring vacation activity. But Northwestern's Prof. J. 
Allen Hynek took it in stride, as he attempted to quell disturbances
of students disturbed by what they regarded as UFO's.

The astronomy department chairman is also the chief scientific 
consultant to the U.S. Air Force on the subject of unidentified
flying objects (UFO's).
