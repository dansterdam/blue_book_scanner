The text in the document is as follows:

"The fire would cut right out from that object it was high first would start with a more like a small flame. Then as it got larger, and larger, it was a more solid like normal, may be yellow in color, like flaming. 
Then it just gone, though the motion of the figure was slow. The woman but asked of any body had called about a saucer? the answer is no, but the size of a mans head is in diameter. Mayabe twelve to fifteen feet high maybe, and that's when the flame first appeared that I saw. The woman well thinklarge the game, and that is what normally did see. He is now out of sight, so I cannot further mention of the character. A minute, quiet a minute. Good evening and may God bless you."
