The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with instructions and diagrams related to reporting sightings of unidentified objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "I" on the curve; line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
