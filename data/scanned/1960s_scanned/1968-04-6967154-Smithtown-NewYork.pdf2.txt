The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book, with a handwritten response to a questionnaire or form. The text in the image is as follows:

"Because the newspaper doesn't seem to give a good account of the incident, please allow me to give you another one on which I am better informed. 
Appears you are very much for your cooperationand please let me know if U.F.O. report form."
