I got scared because it was a big round ball that disappeared in the sky. I was more scared than I have been in a long time. My girlfriend and I were coming back from another galaxy and I was hoping to see it again, but I don't think I will as that, oh well. I didn't take up all your time so that's good.

Sincerely yours

B. I believe in U.F.O.'s and I'm a very religious person.
