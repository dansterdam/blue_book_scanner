This report was received from the AFCIN DO at 0600, 30 May.

The original report was a SAC report from Bliss AFB, El Paso, Texas. A civilian in that area reported seeing a large bright light in the sky. Further investigation indicated that the object had a bright orange tail.

Two El Paso policemen and the Bliss weather observer also saw the object. The policemen reported seeing the object for a short period only and then it seemed to fall to the ground while the other continued its flight. That object did disappear which fell to the ground is being investigated.

A T-33 Acft reported seeing this phenomena near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The entire incident occurred approximately 0302z, 30 May.
