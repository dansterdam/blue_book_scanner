Dear Mr. Quinlan:

Very many thanks for the large batch of reports which you collected and sent to me. As I hastily scanned them over, I was amazed at the amount of work involved in your investigations and estimations. In them I find much that is observed and recorded in fine detail, and from which I believe much information could be gathered.

I wish I could reciprocate by giving you reports on the physical cases you have observed, but the UFO's themselves do not seem to have much effect that I can measure. As most of you will know, this is one of the difficulties we have here of "observing the UFO's." As most of you will know, this is one of the difficulties we have here of "observing the UFO's", a difficulty that has persisted throughout.

I am enclosing the 5 reports you requested from the 1968 files which I hope will be of interest. Let me know if you can use anything else from the Uranographic or 400.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
