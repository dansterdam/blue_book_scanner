The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. 

The text in the document reads:

"Record 37-0. The sky was completly overcast. The entire surface of the clouds appeared solid white. The clouds seemed to be appx. 2000 ft. thick, at least. The temperature was appx 55 to 60 degrees F. Visibility was unlimited in all directions. At appx 6:10 p.m. EST an object appeared to suddenly emerge from the clouds. It was light gray or silver in color, circular in shape, and appx 30 ft. in diameter. The object seemed to just hang motionless for appx 5 seconds. It then accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed straight up through the cloud layer and out of sight in 2 to 3 seconds. The object made no sound whatsoever."
