Text from the document:

"For the past three years or so, I have been somewhat interested in the matter of UFOs, having seen an in-grade on the aircraft on a clear night when I was attending a picnic in Easton, Mass.

At that time, it seemed to be moving at an extremely high rate of speed. It appeared to be in a horizontal plane and seemed to be making a complete circle or oval. The time was approximately 10:25 p.m. on the night of August 8, 1963.

1) 10:25 p.m. seen.
2) 10:55 p.m. extinguished.
3) 11 p.m. 2 or 3 witnesses.

For the thing I saw was quite definitely not a star or satellite, nor have I seen anything like it before or since. It is not easy to estimate the size, but it appeared to be very large, perhaps 50 or 100 feet in diameter. It gave off no lights, but seemed to be illuminated from within, an opalescent glow. If it was an aircraft, it was certainly unlike any I have ever seen, either military or civilian."
