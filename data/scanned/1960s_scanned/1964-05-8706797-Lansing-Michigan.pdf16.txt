Whining Object in Sky Mystifies Lansing

LANSING - An "Unidentified Flying Object" reportedly hovered over the city, drawing sizable attention, on-lookers, and prompting a police call to compare the sighting with similar incidents on previous occasions.

"It was very large, like a basketball and kept falling down like a leaf," according to Don Weigandt, 30, a television newscaster in Jackson.

He said "it was very fast, but seemed to be darting around, not quite knowing where it wanted to go."

Weigandt first saw the object while driving to his East Lansing home along Collins Road. Elmer Speers, of 1008 W. Dunlap, Lansing, said, "I'll swear the thing landed right in my place."

"The revolutions sort of slackened off, like a toy that has been turned off," he said, "then just hung there until it took off again."

Army Capt. Donald Krolson, a graduate student at Michigan State University, said, "I thought it was a furnace starting up again. Then I realized it sounded like a helicopter. So I went outside to check on Cedar St. But it was gone."

One unidentified woman said she saw the UFO rise and then take off again.
