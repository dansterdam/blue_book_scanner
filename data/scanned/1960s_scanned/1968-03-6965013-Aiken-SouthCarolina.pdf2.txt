SJODAN, CAPT., 551 RADAR SQUADRON, AIKEN S.C.
PHONE: COMMENT: SHAW WING COMMAND POST
OPERATIONS AT SHAW AFB, S.C. WAS CONTACTED AND IT WAS ASCERTAINED
THAT ONE SQUADRON WAS FLYING LOCAL FLIGHTS IN THE AIKEN-AUGUSTA
AREA AT THE EXACT TIME OF THE SIGHTING. DUE TO THE SCARCITY OF
INFORMATION OBTAINABLE FROM THE OBSERVER I CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS NOT
A VALID UFO SIGHTING AND THAT FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NOT
NECESSARY. I RESOLVE THE SIGHTING AS A CONVENTIONAL JET AIRCRAFT
PERFORMING LOCAL FLYING IN THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING.
