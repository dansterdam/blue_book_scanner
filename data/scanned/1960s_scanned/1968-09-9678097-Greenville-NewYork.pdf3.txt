HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE - LET'S CALL IT A KA ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION WE SHALL FIRST RELATE. NOW AS WE LOOK AROUND THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE A MARK OR MAKE A DOT TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A SKETCH OR OUTLINE AS TO THE PROBABLE LOCATION OR APPEARANCE ACCORDING TO YOUR DIRECTIONAL MARK ON THE LARGER SKETCH.
