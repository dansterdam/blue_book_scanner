TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT:

 and was observing the stars. About 10:15 PM, I observed a unusual light in the northwest sky. At first I thought it might be a satellite, but as I watched it, I noticed that it was moving in a very erratic and unusual manner, unlike any satellite I have ever seen. After watching it for several minutes, I decided to call my neighbor, [redacted], to come out and observe it with me. We both watched the object for approximately 15-20 minutes. It appeared to be a very bright light, much brighter than any of the stars, and it moved in a very zigzag pattern, changing directions abruptly. At times it appeared to hover motionless, then suddenly dart off in another direction. The light seemed to pulsate or flicker at times. We could not make out any definite shape or structure, just a bright, pulsating light. It finally disappeared from view to the northwest. We were both amazed at what we had seen and could not understand or explain the nature of the object. It did not seem to be an aircraft of any kind, nor did it resemble any known astronomical object. We discussed it for some time afterwards, but could arrive at no definite conclusion as to what it might have been. I have observed many different types of aircraft and astronomical phenomena, but have never seen anything like this before. It was a most unusual and puzzling experience.
