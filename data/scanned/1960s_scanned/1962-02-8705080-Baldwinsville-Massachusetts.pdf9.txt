The image appears to contain two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline), with an object drawn above it. The instructions ask the viewer to mark an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when it was first seen, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when it was last seen.

The second sketch shows a larger landscape view, with a person standing on a road and two smaller inset sketches on the right side. The larger sketch appears to be an example of how to complete the larger sketch mentioned in the instructions.

The text on the page appears to be instructions related to describing the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

Project Blue Book
In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where it was when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
