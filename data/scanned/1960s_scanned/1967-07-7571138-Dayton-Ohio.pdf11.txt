"Dayton, Ohio 
7 July 1967

This report was written by the assistant principal of Kingsmont Elementary School in Dayton, Ohio, in response to an inquiry by the Air Force concerning a UFO sighting. 

On the evening of July 7, 1967, at approximately 9:15 pm, I was in my office at the school when my attention was drawn to a bright light in the southwestern sky. I went outside to get a better look and observed a large, bright, elliptical-shaped object moving rapidly at an angle from the southwest to the northeast. The object appeared to be approximately 1,000 feet in altitude and was moving at a very fast speed, much faster than any conventional aircraft. 

I observed the object for approximately 1 minute before it disappeared from view. It made no sound and left no trail. The night was clear and visibility was excellent. I am confident that what I saw was not a conventional aircraft, but rather some type of unidentified flying object.

I immediately reported the sighting to the Dayton Police Department and the local Air Force base. This is the first time I have ever witnessed anything like this, and I am still puzzled by what I saw that night. I hope this report is helpful in your investigation of this incident.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
Assistant Principal
Kingsmont Elementary School"
