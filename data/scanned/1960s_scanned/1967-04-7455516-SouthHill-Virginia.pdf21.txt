SIGHTING OF 21 APRIL, 1967 
SOUTH HILL, VIRGINIA
by C. M. CRONK

Investigated by:

On Saturday, April 22, 1957, nationwide coverage was given by the press to reports of a sighting of a large UFO seen taking off from a road in South Hill, Virginia. The investigator arrived on the scene at about 9:00 a.m., April 23, 1957. He was met by Sgt. B. H. Raines of the Virginia State Police, who provided transportation and valuable assistance and advice during the entire investigation. Lt. Hedricks of State Police Headquarters in Appomattox, Virginia, had authorized full cooperation and had also conducted his own investigation, the results of which he made available. Cooperation from the Virginia State Police could not have been given more freely, and was of great help.

The principal witness was (703/477-4177) manager of a fertilizer warehouse just on the northeast corporate limits of South Hill. (name redacted), is married and has children; during the investigation many people including all the police indicated that (name redacted), an excellent standing in the community, is a responsible citizen, and would by no means be involved in a hoax or falsehool. "If anyone but (name redacted) had made the report," the comments are, "we would not have believed him, but since it is (name redacted), we know it happened, it happened."

The second witness, who saw a portion of the event, is Mr. (name redacted) who owns extensive tobacco lands just south of and bordering on the zone on which the incident took place. He was not as well known as Mr. Grower, but seemed perfectly honest, even to the extent of sticking.
