Dear Major Quintanilla:

Thank you for your two most recent letters in answer to my request. I hope your Christmas was a happy one.

I still have one comment to make, and will let you know as soon as I receive the copy that was made from the enclosure. Enclosed is a copy of the letter I wrote to Mr. Manley giving a lecture to the Ohio T.S. society member, and it is hoped that he will pass this information on to you.

On November 7, I sent you several fragments believed to be the rilobacterium along with that information. Did you send these fragments to Dr. Brooks for analysis? I would appreciate knowing what results, if any, came about from this.

I am looking forward to the new Fact Sheet.

Yours truly,
