35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I'll try to be as objective as I can in describing this sighting. I do feel that it was a genuine UFO incident and not something easily explainable by ordinary means. My observance was at 7:30 PM, January 8, 1966, at Big Sur, California. I was driving alone along the coast highway when I saw a very bright light ahead of me, probably 2 or 3 miles distant. It appeared to be hovering or stationary, and was brightly illuminated, much brighter than any aircraft lights I've ever seen. As I got closer, I could see that it was not an aircraft, but rather a very large, disc-shaped object, quite low in the sky. The object was extremely bright, like a huge fluorescent lamp, illuminating the surrounding landscape. 

I drove to a point closer to the object, perhaps 1/2 mile away, and could then see its tremendous size, probably 100 feet in diameter. It was absolutely silent, and seemed to give off a pulsing or wavering effect rather than a steady glow. After observing it for perhaps 2 or 3 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated at an incredible speed, climbing straight up and disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. I have no explanation for what I saw, but it was most definitely not an airplane or any ordinary aerial object I'm familiar with.
