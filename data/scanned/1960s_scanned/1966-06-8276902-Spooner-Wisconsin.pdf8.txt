Dear sirs,

Having just received your report on a semi-identical appearing object a few days ago, it seemed to me another manifestation of the type of material that I have been investigating in the last several years. In response to your request for other visual observations that may help pin down this phenomena, I am enclosing a report on a sighting of mine which I feel may be of some value. 
The object in question was observed by myself as well as several others at approximately 5:40 p.m. central standard time on May 20, 1966 in the vicinity of Spooner, Wisconsin. It was a clear day with excellent visibility and the object was under observation for a total of 5-6 minutes. 
As I mentioned in the report, the object appeared to be in a controlled descent and exhibited characteristics that do not fit the description of any known man-made craft. The unusual aspect of this is that the descent was gradual and controlled rather than a ballistic type of trajectory. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if I can be of further assistance.

Sincerely,
Donald E. Keyhoe
