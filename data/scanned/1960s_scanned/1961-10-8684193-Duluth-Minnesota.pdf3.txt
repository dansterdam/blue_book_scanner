This is in response to your letter of October 17 in which you describe observations of an unidentified flying object near Duluth, Minnesota.

As you may know, a number of similar observations have been receiving attention from the United States Air Force through Project Blue Book. The Air Force has concluded that most of these sightings can be explained as natural phenomena.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has asked the Air Force to study this matter further. Your interest in reporting your observation is appreciated.

Very truly yours,
