The image contains two sketch diagrams. The first diagram appears to be an illustration of how an object was observed in the sky, with the viewer's perspective marked as a "B" and the object's location described relative to the horizon. The second diagram appears to be a compass rose or navigation diagram, potentially used to illustrate the motion or trajectory of the observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "x" on the object where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the point where you were when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and in what direction they seemed to be moving.
