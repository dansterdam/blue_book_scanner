There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed letter from Maston M. Jacks of the Public Information Division of the Office of Information, responding to a letter dated December 3, 1963 regarding unidentified flying objects.

The text of the letter is as follows:

December 23, 1963

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your letter of December 3, 1963, which you submitted information relating to a sighting of unidentified objects.

The theories you express are based on assumptions which have not been supported by evidence. To date there has been no "evidence" to support the contention that UFOs are from outer space which would substantiate the existence of flying saucers. The existence of intelligent life on other planets is a matter of conjecture. There has been no discovery of any such life.

With respect to your comment on your son's transfer to a base to California, we have been informed that a request submitted for a reassignment has been disapproved. The policy is to remain consistent with our established commands and not to make unauthorized transfers of personnel officers and hence no action will be taken in this case.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Chief, Public Information Division
Office of Information
