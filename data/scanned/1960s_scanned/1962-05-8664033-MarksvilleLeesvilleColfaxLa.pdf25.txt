May 8, 1962

The following information was received from COLONEL GEORGE EWING, USAF (Ret.),
20 South 4th Street, Leesville, Louisiana.

On May 8, 1962, COLONEL EWING received a telephone call from MAJOR FRED
M. HALL, USAF, stationed at England AFB, Alexandria, Louisiana. MAJOR HALL
stated that he had just received a call from SERGEANT ROBERT MOSCHEL, USAF,
stationed at Barksdale AFB, Shreveport, Louisiana. SERGEANT MOSCHEL informed
MAJOR HALL that he had observed a UFO over the area of Marksville, Leesville,
and Colfax, Louisiana on May 8, 1962 at approximately 1030 hours.

SERGEANT MOSCHEL stated that while on routine patrol, he observed a brightly
lit object, circular in shape, and approximately 50 feet in diameter. The
object was observed for approximately 10 minutes and was moving in a northerly
direction at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 mph. SERGEANT MOSCHEL further
stated that the object appeared to have a metallic outer shell and was giving
off a bright, bluish-white light.

MAJOR HALL in turn contacted COLONEL EWING and requested that he attempt
to obtain further information regarding the sighting. COLONEL EWING stated
that he would make every effort to gather additional details and would report
his findings to MAJOR HALL.
