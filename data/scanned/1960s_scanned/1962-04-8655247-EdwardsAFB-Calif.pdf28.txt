The academic phase of this school's curriculum is divided into four areas: Astronautics, Aerodynamics, Aircraft Operations, and Aeronautical Engineering. Students undergo an extensive training program which includes lectures, conferences, and visits to USAF installations as a part of their studies.
The Aerospace Research Pilot Course is intended to produce test pilots who are qualified in the latest types of military aircraft and spacecraft. Both government and contractor facilities are visited.
