"Concerning sightof around the house light evening, 8 Aug 1960, around 9:30 p.m., causing over the house reflection. I stepped outside to see what it was, appeared to be moving, couldn't locate the source. Tried with the aid of flashlight to try to find. Tried without the flashlight and saw same thing. It was lighting up the whole yard, didn't seem to actually cast a shadow, like a full moon. It was illuminating the area around the house for about 5-10 minutes and then just faded out and was gone. Couldn't determine source or anything."
