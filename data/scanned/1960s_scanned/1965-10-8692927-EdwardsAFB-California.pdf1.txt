At approximately 0720 and 0735L, the radar observers detected and tracked two unidentified bright objects at a range between 020 and 045 miles, traveling at an indicated speed of between 500-600 knots. The objects appeared at their scope for about 10-15 minutes and then disappeared from their scope. The radar operators reported that the objects were observed through binoculars and appeared to be flat, circular, and silver in color. Their flight paths were varying and erratic. Their main change in direction appeared to be a sharp banking turn. The radar operators attempted to get airborne intercept aircraft to the area but they were unable to make visual contact.
