PROJECT 10073 RECORD

Observers watched two orange colored objects which were later defined by them to have two slight white wings or wings flying side by side. A third object joined the first two and all three objects were moving at a rapid rate like four objects were traveling in formation. All were in a horizontal plane traveling toward the NE when they made a slight turn and continued in a path leading toward the south. There are these low level aircraft training routes in the general area. It is possible that the witnesses saw jet aircraft during night training flights.
