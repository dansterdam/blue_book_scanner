FIRST UFOs
OF SEASON 
ARE SIGHTED

Several reports of strange flying objects, like the season, have been reported in this area and a former fighter pilot says he has seen such objects.

The Air Force, which has investigated more than 12,000 sightings since 1947, said the reports do not indicate any threat to the security of the country.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, director of the astronomical observatory at Northwestern University, whose hobby is investigating UFO reports, said the reports did not indicate any unusual activity.

A Hillsdale College man named Stanley McKaigg watched a blue-white object hovering over the college campus for 40 minutes, and it suddenly disappeared. He reported the incident.

Officer Runyan said the object flew over the swamp and was lost in the swamp.

40 in Michigan Say 
A Flying Saucer 
Hoverd in Swamp

ANN ARBOR, MICH., March
9 — (UPI)  — Some 40 persons
said they saw a flying saucer
maneuver over a wooded area
in a swamp near here.

The unidentified flying ob-
jects, described as round and
flashing, were seen for about 20
minutes Sunday evening, the
witnesses said. They said the ob-
jects apparently came to rest in
the swamp.

Air Force investigators were
reported to be checking the area
but reported no unusual activity.

One observer, Stanley Mc-
Kaigg, a Hillsdale College man,
said he watched a blue-white ob-
ject hover for 40 minutes over
the campus before it suddenly
disappeared.

Other witnesses are only iden-
tified as "reliable persons" by
police.
