CAPELLA was on an azimuth of 40 deg and at an elev of approximately 40Â°. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer noted a star-like object in the NE portion of sky which remained stationary. The collecting of data from this unusual and continuous observation for five to ten minutes was made with the use of binoculars. But the most astounding thing was the twinkling star-like object would change color to a slightly bluish obliqe move very rapidly, at times disappearing briefly as though obscured by something. This performance was repeated for over five minutes.
