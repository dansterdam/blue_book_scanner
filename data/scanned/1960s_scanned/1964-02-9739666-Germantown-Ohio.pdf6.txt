The image contains two diagrams, but no photograph. The first diagram is a sketch showing the path of an object in the sky, with the horizon line and the object's elevation marked. The second diagram is a compass rose or navigation diagram.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a line to show how high the object was above the horizon (elevation) when you first saw it. Place a "T" on the curve to show the direction in which the object was traveling.

23. Draw a sketch that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "x" at the beginning of the path, a "y" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
