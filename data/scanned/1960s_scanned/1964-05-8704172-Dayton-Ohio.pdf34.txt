Transcribing the text:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No, dropped below horizon, going South

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? No

17. a. Sound: None
b. Color: White-light

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Won't know

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

A sketch shows an object with a bright, star-like appearance moving across a diagram.
