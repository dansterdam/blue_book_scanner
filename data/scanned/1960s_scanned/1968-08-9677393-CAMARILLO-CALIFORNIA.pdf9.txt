The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

CAMERA VIEWED: BINOCULAR
FOCAL LENGTH: 
SHUTTER SPEED: 
DISTANCE OF WITNESS FROM OBJECT: 
ESTIMATE OF SIZE OF OBJECT: LEVEL FLIGHT (LEVEL)SPEED OF THE OBJECT: 
ESTIMATE OF ANGULAR VELOCITY: SO SLOW THAT I COULD NOT FOLLOW IT WITH CAMERA. DAZZLING AND BRIGHT LIKE VERY INTENSE LIGHT. 
WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE DISTANCE FROM YOU TO THE OBJECT? APPEARED TO BE SOME DISTANCE BUT COULD NOT JUDGE ACCURATELY.
WHAT WERE THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT DETAILS OF COLOR, SHAPE, AND MOTION THAT YOU NOTED? SEEMED TO BE OF BRIGHT METALLIC MATERIAL WHICH APPEARED NEARLY WHITE. MOVEMENT WAS VERY SLOW AND LEVEL AND STEADY.

Along with the image, this would also be the output from the OCR system.
