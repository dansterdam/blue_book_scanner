Investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects
Seagler, Ohio
August 16, 1966

Dear Sir,
On August 10, 1966, I would like to call your attention to the information concerning some Unidentified Flying Objects observed on the night of August 7, 1966, in the skies over Seagler, Ohio.
We observed the objects about 8:45 p.m., on the above date, and they were in the skies for about 45 minutes. The objects were round in shape, gave off a bright reddish-orange light, and seemed to be hovering at times and then darting off at high speeds.  As soon as I first saw the objects, I called my neighbor, Mrs. [REDACTED], and she also observed the objects from her home. We watched the objects for several minutes, and another neighbor, Mr. [REDACTED], also came out and observed the objects. The objects were seen by us and others, and they were very, very unusual and completely unlike any aircraft I have ever seen before.
I would appreciate it if you would investigate this matter further. I am willing to cooperate in any way I can to help solve this mystery.
Sincerely yours,
[REDACTED]
