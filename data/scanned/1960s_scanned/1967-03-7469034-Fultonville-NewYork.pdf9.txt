The image contains a compass diagram and a space for drawing a picture, but no actual photograph is present.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Arranged to be 2. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling. One object which carried into three which dispersed after about an hour.
