CODE:

On Aug. 13, 1960, at about 11:13 P.M. I was watching for the launch of a satellite. I saw a small bright object coming from the direction of Terre Haute, Indiana, traveling rapidly at a constant angle. It appeared to be a large conventional aircraft, however it was completely silent and had no lights. As it passed over my head I could not hear any sound. It seemed to be at about 2500-3000 ft. altitude. As it passed over the house I ran outside to watch it, however it had already disappeared from sight by the time I got outside. The whole observation lasted only about 10 seconds. When I ran outside I could see nothing in the sky. I checked the area thoroughly with binoculars but saw no aircraft, either conventional or otherwise. I could not identify the object nor explain what I had seen. It did not fit the description of any known aircraft. I am quite familiar with aircraft, both military and commercial, and this was definitely something unusual. I would like very much to know if anyone else in the area observed the same thing at about the same time.
