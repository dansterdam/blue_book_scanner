This image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

to seven minutes finding a road over the dunes, and by the time they were in the vicinity of the lakefrond, the object was no longer visible.
On the basis of testimony alone, the object have been about over the lakefrond, or perhaps offshore a mile or so from an unidentified woman living just off Hiley road just the
Sally Averum, who was able to state from the earlier witnesses, as she reported it was observing about 8:20. This is not inconsistent with other report.
As near as can be determined, a the initial view of the object coincided with the evening observation, or followed it a few minutes a five minutes, which is enough time for the witness to reach his first point of observation at Chicago Drive and Hiley Road.
There were two lines of sight from the highway 31 and Hiley also passed through this area.
At about 8:15 this time, the witness reported the object was a silver disc blobby, with a definite outline, reminds his mind of the figure of a sheriff Grysen's position. The line of sight from Highway 31 and Hiley also passed through this area.
As soon as the witness saw the object, he said, it dive bombed to the nearest cottage: he had not gone to look after hearing f-figuring that this was just another UFO report, of which he had had so many. He then went to the window, and immediately saw an object smaller in size hovering about 50 feet above the trees (his upward view was restricted to that amount). The object observed at this point could not have been the same as the one watched for a few minutes and then disappeared. The second object was simply vanish from view.
