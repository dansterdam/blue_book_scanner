Dear Sir:

At 7:50 PM on 9 21 an unusual sight was observed in the northwest sky over Los Angeles. 

Very briefly, this was a brilliant white light which seemed to emerge from a green cloud. I will eliminate further details as I presume you will be receiving many other letters regarding this matter.

I would appreciate your opinion or explanation as to the nature of this occurrence.

Truly yours,
