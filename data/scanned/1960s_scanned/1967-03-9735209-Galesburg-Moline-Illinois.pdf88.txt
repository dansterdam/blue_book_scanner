Air Force Officers See UFO Film
Two U.S. Air Force officers made a "private" screening of a movie film taken by Fisher on Friday after viewing a Moline television showing of the same film (see J.N.Frazier) Friday in the sky. This film apparently shows an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky.
During the "private" screening of the film, one of the officers remarked that the film showed an object with an elongated silhouette, and the film showed a bright light at one point, deep pink at one point.
The two Air Force officers told Fisher to discontinue the film, their request was denied, but Fisher later told the officers he could "be in the laboratory when it is done," so he was allowed to view the film.
For several months, Fisher has been deluged with offers to see the film and acquire it, but Fisher has refused to relinquish the film and apparently remains undecided what to do with the film.
Other UFO developments Friday: Robert Merwin, superintendent of the Kewanee, Illinois, school system, and others found a hot air balloon made of a shiny material found Saturday on the north side of Kewanee. There was a candle tangled in the balloon.
Merwin said the balloon had just been seen by several residents in the Kewanee-Warren counties as late Wednesday, March 8.
University astronomer there stated he saw unidentified flashes in the sky Monday, as did the Bennett, 35, of Chandler, supervising custodian at the University, said strange lights were seen about 9:30 p.m. Thursday in the east-central hill district.
