22 January 1967

1. DG3 Howard E. Sweeney 359 380 USGS, was on Engineer-Security Watch at the USGS Loren Station Johnston Island, located on Sand Island in Johnston Atoll from the hours of 0000 - 0600. At approximately 0500, 22 January 1967, I sighted an object in the Northeast portion of the sky. The path of travel was to the West where it hovered over East Island at a low altitude and emitted a bright light from the vapor ring around it. The object was dish like in shape with a small dome on its top. The vapor ring about it was produced by gas given off from it. The object itself was a bright silver, which illuminated the vapor to a light gray. The object gained altitude and the vapor ring was not seen then, and at this time the object moved towards the West and disappeared out of sight around 0530. Its movement was fast, but you could still distinguish it from a star. The sky was cloudless, but after the object had passed and was out of sight, and after working for approximately 10 minutes, I looked up and the stars were now obscured.
