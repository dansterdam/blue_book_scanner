35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Every vehicle in sight (including some distance away) stopped. Street lights went out. A silent, bright white light, shaped like a saucer, passed overhead at low altitude, casting a bright reflection on the street and surrounding trees and houses. The light source appeared to be confined to the object itself and did not illuminate the area around it. The object was visible for about 20 seconds before accelerating rapidly and disappearing.
