Stationary Object
The "Whittle Mail" on January 3 reported this strange sighting:
The object was first sighted at 23.58 hours on January 3 by a Mr. Hook, who was collecting his son's newspaper deliveries. He said the object first appeared as a bright light, brighter than the moon.
It was a very large, very bright object, he said, stationary in the sky and about 10 to 15 miles away. It was larger than the moon.
Mr. Hook said he watched the object for about 10 minutes and then, at 00.08 hours, it disappeared. There was no sound.
The R.A.F. station at Wyton could not track the object on radar.
A spokesman at the Admiralty air station at Yeovilton said the station had not seen the object reported, but the station was not equipped for surveillance operations.
The local newspapers said there were definite sightings of the object, but the details were distinctly something.
