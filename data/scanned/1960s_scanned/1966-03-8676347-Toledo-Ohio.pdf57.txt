The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document reads as follows:

UFO Photograph
Mrs. G___
6 February 1967

Reference your unidentified photograph that was taken at 1100 hours 27 March 1966 at the Orlando, Florida. Study analysis has been completed with the following results:
a. The images suggest that the photograph was taken through a plate glass window or through an open doorway with an overhang. The images appear somewhat distorted and blurred, possibly due to reflection from the glass of the window or open doorway.
b. Any further detailed analysis would depend upon the receipt of additional information relating to the camera position, light sources and relative location to any surrounding reflecting surfaces.
