The handwritten text in the image is as follows:

My first sighting of a delighted wife and a wild red dog for some unspecified reason. A very bright light seemed to suddenly appear in the sky slightly to the northeast, and then moved slowly to the northwest. The light was variable in intensity, and seemed to flicker or pulsate at times as it moved. It was oval or elliptical in shape, and gave off no beams or other illumination other than its own glow. I watched it for perhaps 5 or 6 minutes until it disappeared below the horizon. The light was bright enough to cast definite shadows on the ground. The dog began barking excitedly during the observation, and the wife was also quite excited, jumping up and down and calling my attention to the light. I could not account for the presence of the dog or the reaction of the wife. No other witnesses. The light appeared to be several thousand feet in altitude and was moving at a low speed, perhaps 200-300 mph. The weather was clear, visibility excellent. No aircraft or other objects were seen in the sky at the same time. The object gave no indication of structure, just a bright oval-shaped light. I frankly do not know what it was, but I am certain it was not an airplane, satellite, or any other familiar object in the sky. I have no explanation for the presence of the dog or the wife's reaction, and can only speculate that some factor unknown to me may have triggered those responses. This is the first and only sighting I have ever had.
