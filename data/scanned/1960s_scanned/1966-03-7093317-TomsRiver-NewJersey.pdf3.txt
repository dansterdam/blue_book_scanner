Text from the document:

"Because a problem and of course causes a delay in the identification of the object. Another delay in identifying balloons is that we have to ask the American people to come forward and identify them. Certain details such as extreme importance in identifying balloon observations.

Militarily, of course, its very important for the good guys' USA, it would hardly a lot of people including the President of the United States. However, the public would finally be thoroughly briefed through NORAD and USAF.

I sincerely don't consider the American people bigoted or narrow-minded. There might exist in some form, on another planet or star in our universe. We ourselves were unable to locate this place. No other planet would have to state, but this is a far cry from proving it.

I'm inclined to believe that the American citizenry would accept the good news that our government would be prepared to welcome their arrival with open arms. And I am as certain as I can be that they world-wide, will detect the presence of a so-called inter-stellar space vehicle should it be en route to this planet. And I am certain that I could detect them with the naked eyes if they should display their presence in some dynamic way which would require a great power source.

As you state in your letter, and I wish that I had more time to spend in answering your questions, but unfortunately time passes much too rapidly."
