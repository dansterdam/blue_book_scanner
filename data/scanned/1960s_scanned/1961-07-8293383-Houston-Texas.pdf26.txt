"NO CASE (Information Only)
13 July 1961
Mt Rainier, Washington

Mount Rainier, famous for Kenneth Arnold's 1947 sighting, was the scene of another UFO incident in 1961. According to the witness, a man who works at a federal governmental installation on the mountain, he was driving up the mountain road to the installation when he sighted an unusual object. It appeared to be a silvery, disklike object hovering in the air not far from the road. He watched this object for several hours before deciding to drive closer to get a better look. However, as he neared the object, it suddenly took off at a very high speed and was lost to sight. He reported the incident to his superior at the installation and was told to say nothing about it."
