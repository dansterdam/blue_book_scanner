Narrative: At 9:30 P.M. on August 6, 1967, I observed an unidentified flying object in the northeast sky over my home in Clyde, N.Y. The object was a bright grayish-white light that seemed to be 50-60 feet in diameter. It made erratic, zigzag movements for about 15 seconds, then suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. There was no sound associated with the object. The sky was clear with stars visible.
