1968 March 20

Flower and Cook Observatory 
Mr. Sam Wesley Quinntanilla, USAF
Lt. Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Two letters from you March 18 are another result from an earlier communication from your AFB will now require.

First: object of 1967 Oct.27- Report from Blytheville, ARK, on subject above said report..... 

Second: Report by description of 1968 Feb.25 20:02 G.M.T. Observations were recorded by three observers of which I was one, at the Flower and Cook Observatory in the University of Pennsylvania. The pilot say it 'all erratically' on Bearing 165 at Elevation 10 degrees 24 minutes. Due to large difference in longitude it could hardly have been same.

Third, unknown object of 1968 March 6 at somewhere near 9:40 p.m. E.S.T. As I merely see it as a report in the press I have no further details concerning it, but questions arise.

Sincerely yours,

[Redacted]
