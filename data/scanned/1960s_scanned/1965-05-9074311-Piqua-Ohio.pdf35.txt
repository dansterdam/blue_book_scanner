OHIO CHILDREN WITNESS NEAR-LANDING. An unusually interesting clipping reached us telling of an incident that occurred in the early evening of May pan when some children who were playing baseball in a residential neighborhood in Leroy, Ohio, sighted what at first appeared to be a strange, object floating over the area. This object was described as being approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter and illuminating or glowing a bright white light visible to the children and some adults in the neighborhood. The object was said to descend and touch down briefly, and to have caused interference with the television sets of nearby homes. When the object departed it did so with great rapidity. There were no signs of physical damage or interference noted, but the incident has caused considerable speculation and investigation in the area.
