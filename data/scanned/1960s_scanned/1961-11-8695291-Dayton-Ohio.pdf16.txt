The image contains two sketches that depict how an unidentified flying object (UFO) may have appeared relative to the horizon (skyline) from the observer's perspective. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" to indicate the height of the object above the horizon, and a second curved line labeled "B" to show how high the object appeared to be from the observer's viewpoint when they first saw it. 

The second sketch shows a larger scene with a person standing on a road or pathway, with mountains or a landscape in the background. This sketch appears to be an example of how to complete a larger sketch to demonstrate the object's position when first seen.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
