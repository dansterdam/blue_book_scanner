Dear Capt Ruppelt,
Sorry I could not write sooner. Was quite busy and could not until today July 9, 1961

On the night of July 8, at 1:26 a.m. I saw a huge yellow object hovering slowly at about an 80 degree elevation approx over the area in approximately an east northeast direction. The object moved silently and was very bright, brighter than the surrounding stars and comparable in size to two moons. It was first sighted in a northwest direction and moved slowly toward the east northeast and disappeared over the horizon in that direction. 

It was observed for about three minutes. I am certain this was not any known aircraft or satellite. I could not determine the size or distance, but it was very large and seemed to be at high altitude. The night was perfectly clear with good visibility. Please advise if you have any information on this sighting. I would appreciate any comments you might have.

Sincerely,
Glen Spry
