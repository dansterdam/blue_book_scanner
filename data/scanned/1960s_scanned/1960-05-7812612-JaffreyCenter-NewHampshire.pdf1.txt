11. COMMENTS:
It is believed that the object of this sighting probably reflects one, or a series of small, dim oscillating or oscillating points of light. If the object had a real solid form, the witness could not have observed it in the manner described. The speed at which the object disappeared would probably have precluded its being observed. It is believed the witness made a wrong estimate of the time elapsed.
