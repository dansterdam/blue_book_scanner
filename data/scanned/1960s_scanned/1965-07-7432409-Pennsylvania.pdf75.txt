SPOTTED IN SEVERAL OHIO CITIES

Unidentified Flying Object
Has Switchboards Humming

By PERCY SMITH
An unidentified flying object
glimmered over Ohio yesterday -
and switchboards jammed with
calls from citizens in several
other cities.

SHORTLY, with the possible ex-
ception of the winona winters,
who once made a record-of-a-
kind accounts for the Air Force,
all kinds of citizens were calling
the cops.

THE SIGHTINGS came on
the heels of an Air Force an-
nouncement that it had picked
up an unidentified object over
Wright-Patterson Air Force base.

It does now, it seems, even
Lynchburge, O. -- a small Air
Force base at Columbus sent up
jets to get a closer look at the
object. The jets reached altitudes
of 60,000 and 50,000 feet.

"THE PILOT reported that he
could not get close enough to iden-
tify the object," said a base
spokesman. "The object was at
an altitude of 21,000 feet â€” the
highest he ventured to reach." 

Government agencies couldn't

agree on what the object, de-
scribed by a meteorological ad-
visory group as a "weather bal-
loon," might have been.

THE FEDERAL Aviation agen-
cy said it had no reports of any
unusual balloon in the skimmed
area.

LAST NIGHT the FAA in
Cincinnati said it, first thought
the object might have been a
weather balloon, but now they're
not so sure.

IT WOULD not comment further.

A spokesman at Dayton's
Wright-Patterson said the Air
Force had tracked the object over
that area, too, but described it as
a "tracking group" which traced
satellites for the government.

ORBIT ANALYST Friend
Hollstein said the object was
quite close, some 20-25 miles
within close range of the sun-
glasses he wears.

Officials at Wright-Patterson
told the Dayton Daily News they
had the object on their scope, but
they did not know what it was. 

They said they tracked it.

Sightings were reported over
Athens, Newark, Chillicothe,
Dover, Springfield and Hamilton.

Mrs. Fred Helmsman of 492
Harrison St., said her son, Terry,
18, spotted the object while he
was mowing the lawn.

"It seemed to stand still," she
said, "and then took off at a high
rate of speed." She said this was
about 4:30 p.m.

LATE this morning, Mrs.
M. L. Bouman of 3417 Catalpa
Dr., Dayton, called the Dayton
Daily News and the Air Force's
Project Blue Book at Wright-
Patterson to report she had seen
the object locally about 9 a.m.

The weather balloon was
released by the Atomic Energy
Commission at Miamisburg.

Mrs. Bouman said it was ac-
counted for several sightings about
6:25 a.m.

Project Blue Book at Wright-
Patterson said one of its technical
staff is investigating to see if it
was, indeed, a weather balloon.
