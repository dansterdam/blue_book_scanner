HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT 
8 SEPTEMBER 1960

INVESTIGATOR'S REPORT

The undersigned investigator visited the reported site on 10 September 1960. The witness, Mr. John Doe, reports observing the following:

On 8 September 1960 at approximately 2030 hours, Mr. Doe was working alone in his workshop, located in the rear of his home. He reports seeing a bright light through a window facing east. Upon investigating, he observed a small, disk-shaped object hovering approximately 50 yards from the workshop. The object was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter and was surrounded by a bright, glowing corona. 

After observing the object for several minutes, it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. Mr. Doe immediately notified local authorities, who arrived on the scene shortly thereafter. A thorough search of the area was conducted, but no physical trace or evidence was discovered.

Mr. Doe is considered a reliable witness. No further information is available at this time. This case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED.
