Mystery Light Panics Couple

At 8:15 p.m. on 3 November 1964, Rudolph Huster, 50, carpenter, and Blanche Huster, his wife, were out walking their backing dog at the Mutano Girl Scout Camp near Pescadero, California. Both suddenly saw a very bright light "about the size of a half dollar" which was hovering about 40 feet off the ground, approximately in the northeast sky. 

Huster said it was "high in the sky" and "just too brilliant to look at." The light pulsated approximately once every 5 seconds. It started to move and began to climb higher. When it reached a point about 150 feet high, the light suddenly disappeared.

Huster said there was no sound, just became larger and larger. Huster told deputies of the incident the next morning and said that after the light disappeared, the couple rushed back into the house and brought their wives out to watch. The light, however, did not reappear. 

The object immediately responded and moved away from the house and went up and off to the north. Huster said the object moved "like a full moon." It was as big as a football.

As the couple went back into the house and brought their wives out to watch, the object immediately responded and moved away from the house and went up and off to the north. Huster said the object moved "like a full moon." It was as big as a football.

The four people then called the Mutano Forest Ranger or Raymond Cavallero, who called the sheriff's office. Deputies who were sent out to the camp reported the object was gone.
