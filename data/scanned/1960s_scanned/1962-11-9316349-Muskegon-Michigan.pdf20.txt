The image contains a compass and sketches on the left side. The compass appears to be a detailed illustration with a sun-like symbol in the center. The sketch on the left shows a curved line labeled with angle markings from 0 to 90 degrees, likely indicating the path or trajectory of an observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.
