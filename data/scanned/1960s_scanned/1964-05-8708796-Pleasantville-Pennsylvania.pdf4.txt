I didn't talk about this for three months except with - - - -. Then this fall, - - - - - the local "Titusville Newspaper" said they had a picture of a UFO, when they were it and it looked like a cloud to me having no particular shape.

The reporter asked me why I had come in. I told him briefly what I had seen (a man from NICAP whom I had never heard of) who came over to the news office and talked with me a couple of hours and gave me a copy of "The Spacecraft Eyidence" .

Not long ago he called me and told me to get a copy of the latest "Flying Magazine" calling my attention to an article by Donald Keyhoe. I got the magazine and read it. When I finished it I would like to know if it is true that the Air Force has a policy of censorship concerning all UFO sightings, as Keyhoe asserted.

Much to all I should like know what you think these white and orange lights were that we saw. NICAP has not been of much help in explaining except to say that they are space ships from another planet. If this is possible I should like to know this also. I am sure that we saw no balloon, plane, or bird unless some type which we do not know of.

Sincerely yours,

P.S. One detail I neglected to mention. At no time did either of us hear any sound that could be connected with what we were watching.  
Also - I could not say for certain that there was a definite connection between the brilliant light I saw and the clear shifting sight that I watched. They may have been two or the same as we saw it going west ahead of the car and apparently it stopped in the field between Pleasantville and Titusville. We saw it standing still two times.
