Text from the document:

Dear Walter Webb,
The original report of the object sighted (on January 8, 1965) by the witnesses covered extensive details and presented a reasonable account of the unusual observation. It appeared to the witnesses to be an extremely bright light or object, much brighter than the planet Venus, which was visible in the sky at the time. The witnesses are considered reliable and their reports were consistent.

Beyond that, we have been unable to determine any further details or evidence concerning the sighting. While the unusual nature of the observation is recognized, the Air Force has been unable to establish the identity of the object or to arrive at a satisfactory explanation.

It is regretted that we are unable to provide you with more specific information about this particular case. The reports received give full details as we have them.

Very truly yours,
(Signature)
Commissioners
