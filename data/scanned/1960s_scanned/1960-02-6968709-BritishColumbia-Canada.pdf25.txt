"THE SIGHT OF A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SKY OVER BURNABY, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA, ON DECEMBER 27TH, 1959.

REPORT BY WITNESS MR. C ------- 

AT ABOUT 9.00 P.M. ON DECEMBER 27TH, 1959, I WAS WATCHING TV IN THE LIVING ROOM OF MY HOME IN BURNABY, B.C., CANADA, WHEN SOMETHING CAUGHT MY EYE OUTSIDE THE WINDOW. ON LOOKING OUT I SAW A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SKY.

THE OBJECT WAS A BRILLIANTLY LIT UP DISC-SHAPED CRAFT, ABOUT 75 TO 100 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT WAS HOVERING SILENTLY OVER THE ROOFTOPS OF THE NEARBY HOUSES, ABOUT 1500 FEET AWAY FROM ME.

THE CRAFT WAS ILLUMINATED BY A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM UNDERNEATH IT. THERE WERE NO ENGINES OR PROPELLERS VISIBLE. THE LIGHT FLICKERED SLIGHTLY BUT REMAINED STEADY.

I CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME IT REMAINED STATIONARY AND DID NOT MOVE. THEN IT BEGAN TO SLOWLY MOVE AWAY, ACCELERATED RAPIDLY, AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT WITHIN ABOUT 10 SECONDS.

THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR AND THERE WAS LITTLE WIND. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS OBJECT BEFORE. IT DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT.

I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE R.C.M.P. THE NEXT DAY."
