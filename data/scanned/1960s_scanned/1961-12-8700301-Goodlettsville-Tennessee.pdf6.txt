UFO Sighting, Goodlettsville, Tennessee
15 MAR 1962

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

The UFO sighted by you and Mr. [REDACTED] on 29 December 1961, near Goodlettsville, Tennessee, was determined to be non-persistent contrails illuminated by moonlight.

The objects appeared to be only five times their usual size because the condensation trails were non-persistent and were dispersing soon after they were formed.

There are two types of condensation trails, aerodynamic and engine exhaust trails. Since the engine exhaust type is usually of short duration, the engine exhaust trails were the ones observed in this case.

Though the sun had set at the time of your sighting, the condensation trails, due to their altitudes, were still in sunlight. The color of the contrails is attributed to dispersion.

We thank you for your interest in reporting an incident which might have been thought to be the sighting of the United States.

Sincerely,

[REDACTED]
DONALD E. KEYHOE
