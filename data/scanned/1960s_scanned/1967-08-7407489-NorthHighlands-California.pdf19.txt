14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The respondent wrote a detailed description about the object disappearing from their view.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The respondent circled "Yes" to indicate the object moved behind something.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The respondent circled "Yes" to indicate the object moved in front of something.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None
b. Color: Bright white - faintly red

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The respondent wrote a detailed description about the size of the object compared to a match stick.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The respondent provided a detailed hand-drawn sketch and description of the observed UFO object.
