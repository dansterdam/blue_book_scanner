and other similar assignable costs.
The unusual requirements of this request for services
makes it easy to forget the usual operational requirements. 
These may be summarized as follows: 1) flight altitude -- 
85,000 to 100,000 feet, 2) flight duration -- up to 24 hours, 
3) approximate weight -- 8,000 pounds, 4) geographical area 
centered on Cape Kennedy with radius of 300 miles, 5) accel-
erations on landings -- less than 1g, 7) accelerations on 
takeoffs on landing -- less than 1g, 8) number of flights -- 
4 engineering and several physics flights spread over 3 to 7
years.

The Panel is requested to approve NCAR participation in 
the flight series which Alvarez proposes if in the Panel's 
view the flights are feasible and warranted by the scientific
merit of the experiments proposed.

10. Water vapor measurement comparisons -- John W. Sparkman

This program is a continuation of a program started in 
November 1962. A meeting was held in Washington, D.C. on 
7 and 8 October 1965 to explore current interest. A resume'
of the status of the program and plans for its future will 
be given by Mr Sparkman at the meeting. Panel comments are 
invited.

11. Another equatorial ballooning expedition suggested -- Robert
S. Roberta

A second equatorial expedition has been suggested by 
Doctors M. E. Kaplan and J. C. M. Dutilh of the University
of Rochester. A copy of a letter sent by them to the scien-
tists listed is enclosed. Appendix B of NCAR has offered to 
provide ballooning advice and perhaps ballooning management 
assistance if it is deemed essential. Panel comments are 
invited.

12. Election of Chairman.

13. Date and time for next meeting.
