The image contains a sketch diagram and a compass rose. The sketch diagram shows the path of an object or objects in the sky, with instructions on how to mark the location of the object relative to the horizon and compass directions. The compass rose appears to be used for reference in determining the direction of the object's movement.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a figure that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
