Dear Dr. Hynek:

I was very happy to receive your letter of 12 February and read with interest your suggestion that the study of UFO's be transferred from intelligence channels to the scientist.

Accordingly, I am forwarding a copy of your letter to Headquarters, Air Research and Development Command with a request that it be considered.

Again, my appreciation for your thoughtfulness.

Sincerely,

D.C. RICHARDSON
