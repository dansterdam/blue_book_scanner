About a year and a half ago I reported seeing a white, partly translucent object which passed through my six inch reflecting telescope. It appeared to be oblong in shape, though it appeared to be the naked eye about the size of a jumbo marshmallow. This incident occurred near Wilmington, Delaware on the August 13, 1961, lunar eclipse. I would certainly know that they balloon through a telescope, there might not have been any visible details other than its shape. About the only thing I can say with certainty is that if it was a balloon, I would have know what it was since a balloon is the only explanation I know that would fit this sighting.

* I was taking a picture with my camera-which doesn't have time exposures and thus I obtained no picture - when the object appeared. And since apparitions are notoriously hard to photograph, there was little Chance I would have gotten a picture even if my camera had had time exposures.

I am writing this ninth-grade theme on flying saucers and would like to use the information from your investigation project on the Air Force saucer * investigation. Thank you.

Perhaps I should say unidentified flying object instead of saucer.

Sincerely yours,
