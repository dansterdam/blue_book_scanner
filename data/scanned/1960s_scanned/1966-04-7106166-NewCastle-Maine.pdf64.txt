KM DONALD G. WESTLAKE, CAPTAIN, CHIEF OF INTELLIGENCE, 15TH AIR DIV. AT THE PLACE WHERE THE OBSERVERS WERE LOCATED, THERE ARE SEVERAL TREES WHICH BLOCK THE VIEW OVERHEAD AND IN THE DIRECTION WHERE THE OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED. IN MY OPINION, THE OBSERVERS WERE VIEWING BRIGHT STARS THROUGH THE RATHER DENSE, BARE BRANCHES.
