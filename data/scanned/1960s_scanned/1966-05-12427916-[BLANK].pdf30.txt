CHANGE
AIR FORCE REGULATION
NO 200-2A

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
Washington, 20 March 1962

Intelligence Activities
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO)

AFR 200-2, 20 July 1962, is changed as follows:

7a. Reporting. USAF Scientific Advisory Group will continue to fix the reporting procedures, which will require prompt reporting by letter; however, keep the use of letter reports to a minimum in reporting initial sightings. The delays often involved in processing and transmitting correspondence through normal channels often make reports of the Agency investigations difficult, producing only limited usable information. This factor is a necessary consideration. Reporting by telephone and/or telegraph will eliminate delays, provide for prompt followup and/or complete report on all sightings, originally restricted electronically, if so required by the Agency.

13a(4). Change "AFCIN" to "AFNIN."

13b. Written Reports. Submit all letter reports (other than initial sightings) through an Authorized Reporting Procedure, 1st Lt. Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, 45433. AFSC (IFT) will distribute the reports to interested intelligence activities in the Air Force and to the Office of Information, if necessary. 

13b(1). Delete.
13b(2). Delete.
16. Change reference to paragraph "6" to "4."
18. Change "TD-E" to "TDEW."
