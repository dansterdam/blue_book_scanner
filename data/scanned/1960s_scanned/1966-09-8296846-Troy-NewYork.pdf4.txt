The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. I will now proceed to act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and output all the text found in the document.

a direct ascent as I it morning' directly over my residence. I a fly a flying at a very high rate of speed and also most certainly at a high altitude. I have seen such objects on prior occasions but this was the closest and most definite observation I have ever made. It was visible in the sky for several minutes and I watched it pass over my residence and then proceed in a southerly direction until it passed out of sight in the distance to the south. I have no explanation for the object, but I can assure you that it was not an airplane, helicopter, or any conventional type of aircraft. It was completely silent and moved with no visible means of propulsion. It appeared to be metallic in color and cigar-shaped, and I am certain that it was not a satellite or any type of natural phenomenon. I hope this report is of some value to your investigation. Please let me know if you need any further information from me.
