There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. It contains a form with various fields for providing information, but there is no photograph included.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: Monday 16 August 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
