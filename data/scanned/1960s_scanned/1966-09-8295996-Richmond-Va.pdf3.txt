The image contains a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page includes handwritten answers to various questions about the observed object, as well as a hand-drawn sketch of the object.

Text extracted from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Gradually and finally seemed to disappear into the horizon.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes.

17. a. Sound None
b. Color Faint white-pale red-amber light

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object of a comparable size. Tell us how many times the object would cover this known object if you had performed this experiment. Approximately about 1/2 the size of the known match stick.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or any other peculiar details you may have observed inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
