The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. The document includes handwritten notes and calculations related to the analysis of some lights observed in the sky.

Text from the document:

10 sec
night 200 ft
speed 15 mi/hr
object came garden direction
moved used beam of search light to

*2625* 
50 ft

X = 200 sin .0625*
20' 
50' = .0625* Y = 260.0625* = 3.7' 
= 260 sin 3.7' = 200 + .0625* 
= .23 ft
mydya diameter undoubtedly as on at least 10 m - 3.4x10-2 
1 m = 
15x10*3.4x10*3 = 7.2x10*6
and would have used only 220 ft.

The configuration of this light does not conflict with any an aircraft.
