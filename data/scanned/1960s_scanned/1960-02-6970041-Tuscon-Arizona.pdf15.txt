Since Wednesday the sky has had rather heavy cloud cover to the west. We have been driving out and watching the sky again. we have not noticed but a light reflection, both because of the cloudy shape and because of the strange effects of "might that looks off and then vanishes to the distant."

Is any of this of interest to you?

Sincerely yours,
