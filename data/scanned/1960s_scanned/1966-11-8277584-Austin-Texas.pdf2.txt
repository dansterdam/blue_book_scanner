The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, specifically a report dated November 8, 1966 from Austin, Texas.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
TAPED - 20 FEBRUARY 1964, SPECIAL AGENT JAMES M. JONES, 7503 STU-MV, PRECEDED AFTER A DEBRIEF1 NG OF THE FIVE OBSERVERS, IS THAT THEY WERE LOOKING ON OBJECT THAT APPEARED TO BE SHARPLY RISING FROM THE GROUND AND THEY SAY A FLYING SAUCER. THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE OBSERVING AN AIRCRAFT UNTIL THEY WERE UNABLE TO RECONCILE WHAT THEY SAW WITH NORMAL BEHAVIOR OF AIRCRAFT. NO OTHER REPORTS WERE RECEIVED ABOUT THIS INCIDENT. I BELIEVE THAT THE OBSERVERS SAY AIRCRAFT APPROACH THE AUSTIN, TEXAS AND DEPART TO THE NORTHWEST.

AGENT'S REMARK:
THE UNUSUAL APPEARANCE TO THE OBSERVER6 IS DUE TO THE LIGHTS OF NEWTON AUSTIN AND VIEWING OF THE AIRCRAFT FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE.
