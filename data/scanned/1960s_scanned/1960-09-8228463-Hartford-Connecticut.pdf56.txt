This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing the analysis of carbonaceous samples related to a UFO incident. The text includes details about the composition and characteristics of different types of samples, as well as observations and analysis of the samples.

The text in the document is as follows:

The numerical sequence was obtained to avoid possible confusion with the sample materials.

As can be seen, the 11 segments can be put into 5 groups:

1. carbonaceous
2. high-metallic (aluminum)
3. stony
4. slag

Of these, the slag seems certain to be of Hartford origin, the stony and high-metallic are also probably the same, the carbonaceous, however, do not seem clearly due to the observed fall, and, therefore, the most time was spent in their analysis.

Analysis of carbonaceous samples

The carbonaceous samples are 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9 and the 11 "black light ball" are very similar in composition. They look like coal, and the Geiger counter showed a high count, indicating they are highly radioactive. Sample 5 (coalish, mounted with white-coated side toward the background sample) when compared with the background sample 10 and 11 shows large differences, namely that it contains large amounts of Sr (up to 10% by wt.), Ba (over 1% by wt.), and long- lived radioactive elements. The heights of the major order peaks are as follows: using a 1/4 crystal and 1/8 source aperture at 19 KV and 10 ma.
