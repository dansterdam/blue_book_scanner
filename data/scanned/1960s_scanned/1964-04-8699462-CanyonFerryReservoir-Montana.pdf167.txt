MORE SAUCER LANDINGS IN MONTANA: According to a weird story in the Missoulian-Sentinel, an Missoula, Montana, flying saucer has been landing frequently at a farm near there ever since early last April. Mr. and Mrs. Allen Lung, who live on the saucer as a mountain say that the object has landed within a few hundred feet of their house, and have asked through the saucer lights around its circumference. It also has a single large light on its slightly illuminated disc. 

There have been many side-effects of these frequent visitations. Before the landings began, the wild game much as deer used to visit their property. Crows, starlings, and many other birds would dwell around their home, but ever since last April, causing the latter to stampede. Every time the UFO is in the vicinity, their dog, which is normally unafraid, has told his parents of a man with whom he talks, though he has told them the man's name. But no one else besides this little boy seems to be present on these occasions, and is sometimes away for hours. Each time the boy goes into the house and the oil furnace lights go out. Television interference has also been noticed during the saucer visitations, which have continued at almost regular intervals for several months!
