The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed report about a UFO sighting. The text describes several lights in the sky that were observed on the 3rd of August 1966 in the Philippines. The lights appeared to be steady with an occasional blinking, and moved at a high rate of speed compared to the observer's aircraft. The report is signed by George R. Staines, who was the flight mechanic.

UFO SIGHTING 

On the 3rd of August 1966, several lights in the sky which to me could not be logically explained, sighting our airPlanes on the south of our position (to the south of our position).

The lights appeared generally steady with an occasional blinking. There was no apparent movement, but as I watched, the lights disappeared and reappeared to the rear of our aircraft, when I last saw the lights they were to the left front of our position.
