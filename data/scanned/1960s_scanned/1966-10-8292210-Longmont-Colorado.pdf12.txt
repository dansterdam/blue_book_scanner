30. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS, OR A SIMILAR OBJECT BEFORE. IF SO GIVE DATE OR DATES AND LOCATION. (IT WAS THE GREATEST OR MOST PECULIAR LIKE AT 8 PM 10/8/66 NO FLASH NOR SOUND. IT MOVED IN STRAIGHT LINE THEN MADE SHARP TURN THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND TREES) IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCURATE DESCRIBE THE CRAFT DUE TO ONLY SEEING IT FOR A FEW SECONDS.

THE OBJECT I SAW ON OCT. 8, 1966 WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAVE SEEN BEFORE OR SINCE. IT WAS VERY BRIGHT, MOVED IN A VERY UNUSUAL MANNER, AND DISAPPEARED QUICKLY BEHIND TREES.)
33. WHEN AND TO WHOM DID YOU REPORT THAT YOU HAD SEEN THE OBJECT? [Redacted]
