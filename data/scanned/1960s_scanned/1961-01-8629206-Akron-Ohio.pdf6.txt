ASK ACTIVITY REPORT (Page )

ITEM 9 (CONT) - We believe that by utilizing the civilian UFO organizations two things can be readily realized:

1. Obtain any/all available information that may contribute to the solutions of UFO reports via the most economical means available to responsible USAF/ATC departments.
2. Realize a very amicable and cooperative relationship between officers of the DOD and the American Public which during the past years has become increasingly more antagonistic in many areas to include congressional interest.
