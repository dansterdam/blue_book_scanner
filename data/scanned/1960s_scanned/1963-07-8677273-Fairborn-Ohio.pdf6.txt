20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "Y" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
NW to SE orbited path about 5000'
approx 70' above night to 80-90' above horizon

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
Medium

22. We wish to know the size, color, and shape of the object, and more, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment with a match at the time the object was sighted, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Unknown

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Could not see in front 5 sec

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object.
