The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing some details or observations.

The text found in the document is as follows:

"The object appeared in the north in a southerly direction. It was a round, glowing object and appeared to have some sort of indentation or cavitity in the center. It hovered at about a 30 degree angle to the horizon and then suddenly shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object was observed by myself and several other people for about 5 to 6 minutes. The color was a bright white. The object was visible long enough for me to obtain a fairly good look at it and to make the above description. It did not appear to have any rotational motion and remained stable throughout the observation. I can say with complete certainty that this was no conventional aircraft or known type of object. At the time of the observation, the weather was clear and calm with good visibility."
