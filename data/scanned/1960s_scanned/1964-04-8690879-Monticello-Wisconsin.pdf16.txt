At the closest approach, the object was behind telephone poles and telephone wires and silhouetted at an angle of about thirty degrees. It was so large that although they viewed it merely by looking through the telephone wires, some of the lights were nonetheless above the telephone wires. The arrangement of the lights, as we could best discern, were arranged as though they were on a "flying hatches" or "inverted saucer" although at no time were any of them able to see any body to the object or any superstructure. Only the fact that the lights maintained a geometrical relationship throughout the sighting led them to believe that the lights were linked attached to a physical structure of some sort. A few times they gave the impression that the red lights did appear to change in intensity, but they passed this off as being due to the object's then passing all only to the rear at which time the red glare of the object, turned on the roadlights, and drove a head to turn around.

The witness's description of the motion and pattern of the lights indicative of an intelligently controlled flight, but they did not see any shape of the object. The object disappeared very quickly into the distance or horizon. The whole duration of sighting was somewhere between five and fifteen minutes. They did drive the car a considerable distance before stopping and turning around, and as I would say five minutes is about a minimum time for the intelligent operation and that it "appeared interested in the car." At some time or other during the observation, the pilot noticed green lights as well.

All data would indicate the impression that a soliderlike shaped object had approached them.
