"The person who had the experience of the object is Alexander Air Corp Pilot. The object was sighted at approximately 12:15 AM on September 1, 1964 at Clearwater Beach, Florida.
The object was described as a silver, shiny, metallic object, shaped like a flattened sphere or ellipse, hovering in the air approximately 50-100 feet above the water. It hovered there for about 5-10 minutes, giving off a glowing light, and then suddenly shot off at a very high rate of speed, north-west.
The object seemed to have perfect control over its motions, and appeared to be intelligently controlled. The pilot estimated the size of the object to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter."
