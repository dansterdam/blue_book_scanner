"DEPT (USO) Lt. Col Quintanilla/7709/dre/16 Aug 63
UFO Observation, 7 July 1963

NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10009

1. Reference your unidentified observation of 7 July 1963, which you reported to the Air Force on 9 July 1963. Office of Information.

2. Our satellite records indicate that at 1:33 am, EST, 7 July 1963, ECHO II was at an altitude of 640 miles, traveling roughly from the north to the south, and may have been visible from your location (approximately 7:33 pm). The satellite was at an altitude of 640 miles, and was visible for approximately 16-20 minutes.

3. The latitude, longitude, 649 miles altitude and should have been visible from your location from 7:33 pm for approximately 16-20 minutes. The satellite was picked up into the earth's shadow and would not have been visible any longer.

4. This, I believe, accounts for the bright object you observed on 7 July 1963. The satellite would have been at maximum brilliance low on the horizon to the northwest and would have been the brightest object in the sky other than most stars. The satellite would have continued to dim as it rose higher and then passed into the earth's shadow.

5. Our main, thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. As you described it in the AF Form 117 that you completed.
