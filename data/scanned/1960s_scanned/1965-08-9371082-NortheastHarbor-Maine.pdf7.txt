Transcribed text from the document:

The object was approximately 20 feet in diameter, egg-shaped and slightly raised in the middle. It appeared to be surrounded by a soft white glow. The object was first sighted at about 10:30 pm and was visible for approximately 30 minutes. It was observed moving slowly at first, then seemed to accelerate rapidly and disappear from view to the northwest. Two independent witnesses reported the sighting. The weather was clear and the sky was filled with stars.

Jackson (aster) and I observed the object together for about 20 minutes. We were camping in the woods near Northeast Harbor, Maine. The object appeared to be just above the treetops. It was silent and did not seem to be attached to any supporting structure. We were both surprised and puzzled by what we saw. The object appeared to be under intelligent control, but we could not determine its origin or purpose. 

The Air Force was notified of the sighting shortly after it occurred. An investigator was dispatched to interview us, but we were unable to provide any additional details beyond our initial report. The case was classified as "Unidentified" in the Project Blue Book files.
