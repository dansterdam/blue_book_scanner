Text extracted from the document:

The object was first seen in the east at approximately 10:18 PM, MST, on July 7, 1962. The object appeared to be hovering at an estimated altitude of 2000 to 3000 feet. Its size was estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter.

The object was observed for a period of approximately 15 to 20 minutes, during which time it made a series of abrupt turns and changes in altitude, hovering at times, and at other times accelerating swiftly and disappearing from sight, only to reappear moments later. It was described as a bright light, changing colors from white to red to orange, and it left no exhaust or trail.

No sounds were heard during the observation. The weather was clear, with no clouds, and the moon was approximately 75% full. Casper, Wyoming, is the location where this incident occurred.
