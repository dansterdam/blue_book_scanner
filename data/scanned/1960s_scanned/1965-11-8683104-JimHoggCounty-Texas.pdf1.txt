Laredo, Texas
Location: Chaparosa Ranch, Jim Hogg County, Texas
Laredo, Texas
November 21, 1965, 6:31 PM to 6:36 PM

The report describes an encounter where the witness and himself, UPON leaving a home on the ranch, saw an object in the sky. The witness described it as an intense red, flashing-like object that the witness thought was a plane. The object maneuvered and was shaped differently than a plane. The sky was mostly clear with some long clouds thinly scattered to the south. There was no sound whatsoever at any time.

At 6:47 PM an aircraft came flying from the direction of the object. The witness stated it was a Texas aircraft, but now appeared to have increased speed and altitude, as if chasing the object. The object was gone within a few minutes and the aircraft continued on.

My comments are that this object was like other objects only this one seemed to be all of one color, intense red, and could maneuver differently than a plane or aircraft. It appeared to be on top of the object. The characteristics of the light were the same as the same intensity and blinking before it seems to be on top of the object.

Report #5.
