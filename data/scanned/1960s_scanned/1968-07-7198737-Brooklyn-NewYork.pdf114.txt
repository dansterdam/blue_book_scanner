UFO Reports from Brooklyn, New York

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of several unidentified flying object (UFO) reports from observers in the Brooklyn, N.Y. area. These observers have been calling the Duty Officer collect.

2. On 16 and 19 August 1968, this office verbally requested that the Brooklyn, N.Y. field office of the FBI obtain additional details regarding these particular sightings. However, they are continuing to call. Therefore, I recommend the following:

a. Stewart AFB, New York, area code 914, John R-1300.
b. Suffolk County, N.Y., area code 516, Southampton 4-1900.

3. If the caller is persistent, please inform him in a kindly manner regarding the proper procedure for the reporting of UFOs. In addition, the local UFO investigator is in a better position to conduct an on-site investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

Lt. Attached is a listing of those persons who have been calling from the Brooklyn, New York area.
