The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a typed document. There is text in the upper portion of the image describing something observed that was characterized as very fast and bright. The text mentions that the object was observed by multiple witnesses, none of whom were able to identify it.

Something with such speed and size that it was noticed from 2 separate locations at that total time of observing was of a very definite object over three seconds of observing. 5 o'clock in the the setting when the light went out. It seems some kind of object three witnesses noticed in three separate areas over five minutes time Observed by them in three separate locations and then the light went out. This was noted by three different witnesses, none of whom could identify what they observed.
