The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 5 Day Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

There seem to be several lines of handwritten text that are difficult to read, but it appears to describe some additional details about the sighting that were not covered in the specific points of the questionnaire.
