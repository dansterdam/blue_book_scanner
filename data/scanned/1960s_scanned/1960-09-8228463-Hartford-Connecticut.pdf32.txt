S U B J E C r: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting

1. On 8 September 1960, the undersigned received a telephone call from Mr. Robert R. Reed, 205 Garden Street, Hartford, Connecticut. Mr. Reed reported that on the evening of 7 September 1960, at approximately 7:15 p.m., he observed an unidentified flying object while driving his automobile on Interstate Highway Route 91, in the vicinity of Windsor Locks, Connecticut.

2. Mr. Reed stated that as he was driving northbound on Route 91, he observed a bright light in the sky to the east of his position. He further stated that the object appeared to be stationary, and was brighter than the surrounding stars in the night sky.

3. Mr. Reed reported that he drove to a rest area on Route 91, located approximately two miles south of the Massachusetts-Connecticut state line, in order to observe the object more closely. He stated that upon arriving at the rest area, the object appeared to move in an easterly direction at a high rate of speed, and subsequently disappeared from view.

4. Mr. Reed described the object as appearing to be round or oval in shape, and estimated its size to be approximately the same as a full moon. He also stated that the object emitted a steady, brilliant white light.

5. No photographs or other physical evidence were obtained regarding this incident.
