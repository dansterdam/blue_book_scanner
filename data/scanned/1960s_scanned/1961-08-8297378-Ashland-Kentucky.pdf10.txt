The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a sketch or diagram that instructs the viewer on how to indicate the sighting of a UFO. The diagram includes instructions for marking the location of the UFO sighting on a compass-like diagram, as well as instructions for drawing a picture to show the motion or path of the observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the sacred line to show how high the object was above the horizon. Place an "B" on the compass when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Give a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
