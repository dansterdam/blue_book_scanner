REPLY TO
ATTN OF: L8L (UFO) 16 JUL 69

SUBJECT: Physical Specimen, 13 July 49

TO: Dr J. Allen Hynek
Reference the attached specimen that was sent to this office under date of 13 July 1949. This sample was obtained with the cooperation of the Greenland base that reported one of the so-called "flying saucers" to have been seen.

The sample has been studied by the Northwestern University and they report to us that it appears to be a piece of cellulose material, no different from ordinary cigarette paper. They are unable to find any unusual characteristics in it so that we can send it back to the owner.
