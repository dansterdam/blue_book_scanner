The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a UFO report form.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
