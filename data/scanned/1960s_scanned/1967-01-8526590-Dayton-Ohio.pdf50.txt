"3 UFO'S SEEN IN AREA...TWO UFO'S DESCRIBED AS SAUCE-SHAPED OBJECTS WITH RED, WHITE AND GREEN LIGHTS MOVING SLOWLY THROUGH THE SKY. DURATION OF OBSERVATION APPROX 1-2 MINUTES. AT ABOUT 1:30 AM, CALLED MILITARY BASE BUT THEY COULD SEE NOTHING ON RADAR. AFTER THAT, OBSERVED OVER AN ADJOINING COUNTY. FIRST UFO DESCRIBED AS OBLONG-SHAPED, BRILLIANT WHITE IN COLOR WITH RED AND GREEN LIGHTS ON THE OUTER RIM AND AFTER HOVERING FOR A SHORT PERIOD, IT TOOK OFF AND DISAPPEARED AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED. AND DISAPPEARED IN MINUTES.

TWO UFOS WHICH APPEARED OVER HIGH VALLEY VALLEY THIS WEEK MAY BE RELATED TO REPORTED SIGHTINGS RECENTLY SEEN OVER MICHIGAN-REPORTS INDICATE THAT OBJECTS SEEN IN BOTH SECTIONS CAN BE CONSIDERED ROUGHLY SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE. THE TWO UFOS OBSERVED HERE HOVERING OVER HIGH VALLEY WERE REPORTED TO BE SAUCER-SHAPED, WITH RED, GREEN, AND WHITE LIGHTS FLASHING IN SEQUENCE AROUND THEIR RIMS, AND WERE SAID TO BE SILENT IN OPERATION, AND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A MEDIUM-SIZED AIRCRAFT. ONE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT IN THE SKY WHEN HE FIRST NOTICED IT, BUT HIS ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY ITS APPARENT CHANGE IN POSITION. THE LIGHT MOVED VERY SLOWLY, HE SAID. THE OBJECT LATER SHOWED UP IN A DIFFERENT POSITION. HE AND HIS WIFE WATCHED BOTH OBJECTS FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES UNTIL ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY SHOT UPWARD AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED, AND DISAPPEARED IN MINUTES."
