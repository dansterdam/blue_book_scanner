There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed document from Project Blue Book, which seems to be describing a UFO sighting report.

V.F.R. air traffic on down-wind, base, and final to runway 27 at Stewart AFB flyover and parallel the Beacon-Newburgh Bridge. TAGAN approach 3 and Enroute/TAGAN approach to Stewart also parallel the Bridge on final. In addition, numerous VFR traffic use the Bridge as a check point and the Hudson River as an airway. The 90th Troop Carrier Group (CONAC) at Stewart AFB is presently checking out in C-124 aircraft and were flying approaches to runway 27 on the date of Mrs. Smith's sighting.

(1) All available evidence indicates that Mrs. *** observed an aircraft.
(2) Mrs. *** is very sketchy on the date and time of her sighting and as a result, it is impossible to exactly match her observations with reported traffic.
(3) A C-124 on base to Runway 27 at 1000 hours would appear the same as the description Mrs. *** gave of the object she sighted. The C-124's relatively small wings compared to its fuselage would appear as a elongated silver object in the shape of a short cigar.
(4) I questioned toll takers who were on the Bridge at the time of the sighting. They stated there was very heavy air traffic but nothing unusual.
(5) Traffic on the Bridge and its location justified two large towns base me to believe that any UFO would have instigated hundreds of telephone calls than just Mrs. ***. Obviously what Mrs. *** saw was not considered unusual by hundreds of other pairs of eyes.
(6) Refer to G(2).
