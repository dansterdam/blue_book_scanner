Imagery Vapor Trails

The Melbourne, Australia Herald of 13 January 1965, reported an article about a curious incident involving a USAF C-124 transport plane which encountered a mysterious vapour trail. The article reads as follows:

"The RAAF spokesman in Canberra said the claims that official official from the United States had disced the object were a flight made by a C-124 transport plane from the United States that the initial report was partly incorrect. In fact, he said, the C-124 had encountered a mysterious vapour trail while flying over the Pacific and the pilot had called to identify the flying object responsible from the vapor trail."

Captain D. Shannon and the crew of the Westralia, which was enroute to Australia at the time, reported sighting the same "vapor trail" formation. Shannon reported that the trail was observed to be moving from west to east. The trail appeared to disintegrate as Shannon watched it.

An RAAF spokesman in Canberra said the claims that official observers from the USAF had identified the object were incorrect. He stated that the C-124 had encountered a mysterious vapour trail while flying over the Pacific and the pilot had called in to identify the flying object responsible for the vapor trail.

The initial story was badly handled in detail but it is recommended that no further action be taken since the affair provides no substantial evidence of anything more than unusual atmospheric conditions.
