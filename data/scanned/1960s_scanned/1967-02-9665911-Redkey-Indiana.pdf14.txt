The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a compass rose and provides instructions for the observer to imagine the point they are at and how high the object was above the horizon. The second sketch asks the observer to draw a picture that would show the motion of the object or objects, and place an "X" at the beginning of the path to show any changes in direction during the course.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
