Balloon Drops In On Ohio 
PORTSMOUTH, O. (AP)â€”George L. Gus tin, pilot of a plastic balloon, dropped in on Portsmouth from France Saturday.
The Dayton Journal Herald here carried a story and photograph of the unexpected visitor.
Gustin said the big balloon was launched from Villacoublay, near Paris, on July 19 on a voyage to the United States. It had been aloft more than 57 hours.
Gustin said the landing in Ohio was intentional, that he was aiming for the Ohio River near Portsmouth. The landing caused considerable excitement in the area as the descending balloon was first mistaken for a parachutist falling to earth.
Gustin explained to newsmen that the flight of the balloon had been smooth except for some buffeting by winds. He said the balloon would be retrieved and returned to France.
