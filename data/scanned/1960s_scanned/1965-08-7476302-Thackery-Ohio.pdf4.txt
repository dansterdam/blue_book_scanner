18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
OBJECT WAS T SIZE THAN PLANET JUPITER. LARGEST STAR I HAVE SEEN. SO BRIGHT IT LOOKED BIGGER THAN JUPITER'S DISK.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please be accurate in your drawing to show the direction in which the object was moving.
THE OBJECT WAS TO HIGH TO DETERMINE ITS EXACT CONFIGURATION. IT WAS WING-LIKE. SOME PARTS OF IT DID LOOK LIKE WINGS. HOWEVER, IT IS INCONCLUSIVE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE OBJECT CAME FROM THE EAST AND THEN HEADED TO THE WEST THAN SEEMED TO RETURN TO THE EAST AND THEN MOVE TO THE NORTH AND DISAPPEARED TO DIRECTION.
