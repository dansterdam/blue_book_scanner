10. CONCLUSIONS: Possible Aircraft; Possible Missile; Probably Balloon; Possibly Astronomical; Possibly Hoax; Insufficient Data; No Identification; Probably Witnessed Something of Interest
11. COMMENTS: Past cases have shown that witnesses to UFO incidents often interpret what they see in a different manner than is actually the case. This incident would appear to be a case in point. The radar pick-up was probably a normal aircraft or balloon. The visual sighting was probably a natural phenomenon or some type of man-made object, but there is insufficient data to identify it conclusively. Without further information this incident must be classified as "No Identification".
