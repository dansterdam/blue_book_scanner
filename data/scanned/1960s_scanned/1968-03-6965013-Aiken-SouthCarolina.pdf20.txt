Dear Sir:
I at the woman at the radio station told me about the flying object. When you report it to the public they always tell you the public must be mistaken. What they air calmly tells you is a misidentification and I wonder why gentlemen position are so in public's misunderstanding. I thanks if you do know what they are.
