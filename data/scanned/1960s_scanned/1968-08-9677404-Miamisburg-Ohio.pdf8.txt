The image appears to contain two illustrations. The first is a compass-like diagram with directional labels and instructions. The second illustration shows two landscapes - one with a person standing in the foreground, and one with a bright object in the sky.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE PLACED EXACTLY AS IT IS ON THE COMPASS: HOW WOULD THE OBJECT YOU HAVE JUST SEEN BE POSITIONED IN RELATION TO YOU AND THE COMPASS? PLACE AN X-G" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE OBJECT WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCHES BELOW, PLACE AN X-AS' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENONG WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A TS AT THE POSITION AS IT WAS LAST SEEN. IF THE OBJECT MOVED, WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO THE SYMBOLS BELOW AS AN EXAMPLE OF ITS TO-COMPLETE MOVEMENT.
