The image contains a handwritten letter addressed to "Dear Sirs". The letter appears to be describing a UFO sighting, with the writer stating that "it was about 10 o'clock" when they saw something unusual in the sky. The writer goes on to provide some details about the object they observed.

Here is the text of the handwritten letter:

Dear Sirs,
I saw this at 10 o'clock when we came home from a party. It was above the trees and stayed for a short while and then went behind the clouds. It made no noise and looked almost solid. It was about 35 to 40 feet in diameter and had little lights around the outside and a little light inside. The whole thing moved as one unit and did not come apart or separate in any way. This is about all I can tell you. I hope this helps in some way.
Yours truly,
