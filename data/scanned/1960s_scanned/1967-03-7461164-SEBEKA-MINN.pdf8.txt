There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report document, containing handwritten responses to a questionnaire.

The text in the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: The sound was a constant 7-8 feet over ground
b. Color: Bright glowing reddish orange - very bright
17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, tail, vapor trails, etc. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred b. Like a bright star c. Sharply outlined d. Don't remember
19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
