SUBJECT: UFO Report from Bitburg, Germany (U)

TO: TDEER (Maj Quintanilla)

1. (U) The date submitted is not sufficient to make a firm analysis of this sighting. However, it appears feasible to eliminate the sighting as a possible hoax, since the apparent brightness of 2000 mph is highly unlikely, considering speed alone; but it is highly unlikely that the object could have traveled the indicated distance from Wittlich, Germany to the area. Further, it would appear that a missile, fired intentially or accidentally, would have been noticed in the area.

2. (U) Since other T-33's in the area noted nothing unusual, the probability of equipment malfunction seems to be somewhat greater than a "sighting" of a phenomenon. These are fairly standard troubleshooting conditions.

3. (U) Offered as a remote possibility is an accidental or medium scale disscrete CRT display diversion, which could conceivably cause the phenomena reported by the aircrew. The U.S. Air Force has used such CRT displays in the past and probably experimentating with them to some degree.
