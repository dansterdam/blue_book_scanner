There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a series of questions and answers.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know.   If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:
A cloud

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know.   If you answered YES, then tell what in front of:
A cloud

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
Soundless
b. Color
Red, oblong

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About 5 to 6 seconds

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
