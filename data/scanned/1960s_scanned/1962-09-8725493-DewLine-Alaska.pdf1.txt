PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 21 September 1962
2. LOCATION: New Ling, Alaska
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1515, 21 Sep 62
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: No
6. DURATION: 10 seconds
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 seconds
8. RELIEF INFORMATION: Radar paints and visual station gave objects heading NNE. In bright sunlight 30 seconds then disappeared. Objects gave definite indication they were visible.  Not close enough for details, too far away, however, to be associated with weather-visual visibility conditions. Could not be pinned down further due to brevity of observation.
