Dear Sirs,
I am writing to inform you of a strange U.F.O. sighting at February 23, 1965.
We were driving home on the highway at about 9:30 p.m. and noticed a bright light in the sky, stationary at first, then it started moving slowly. It would stop and start again, moving in an erratic manner. The light was very bright and seemed to be about 500 feet in the air. We watched it for about 15-20 minutes and it eventually disappeared in the distance.
We have related this incident to many persons, but of course none can verify it as no one else seems to have seen it. If just anyone could write, it might be of some value.
I hope this report will be of some interest to you. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Sincerely yours,
[Name redacted]
