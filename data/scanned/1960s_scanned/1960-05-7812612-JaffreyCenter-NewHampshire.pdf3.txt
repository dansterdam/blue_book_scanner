Any the varied variations in brightness were - 
Did it explode, disintegrate, or suddenly vanish? No.
Did it trail or fall? No.
Did any sound accompany the object? No.
If sound followed later, give time interval: No.
Was it examined with binoculars or telescopes or photographed? No.
Any other remarks: I was definitely wide awake, for I had just looked at my watch & turned up to see what was happening, so dull and unexpressed as it may have been, I was thoroughly awake and my mind was in perfect working order. The object that I saw passed by so quickly that of the details of its shape or appearance I am entirely uncertain. It was gone almost as soon as I saw it, and left no impression on my senses except that of a bright flash in the night sky which went by so swiftly that I could only say that there was a white or silvery object of some sort which vanished from sight.
Address: Jeffrey Center, New Hampshire.
I reported this verbally by telephone May 23, 1960, but this was only about my reaction. This was a pretty casual report. Regards, (Signature) Aug. 12/60.
