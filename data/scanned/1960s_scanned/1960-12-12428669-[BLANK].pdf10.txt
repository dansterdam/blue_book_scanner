COLONEL TACKER: Well, if they believe this, Ann, it's as a pure out of faith. Actually the Air Force does not deny the fact that many solid citizens have seen objects or phenomena in the sky which have mystified them for a time. In most instances when they reported these sightings to the Air Force we have been able to identify the object or the phenomena that they viewed and in most instances the reporting persons are satisfied with our interpretation.

GORRICK: Sid Davis. 

DAVIS: Colonel, in your book you say "there are just not any manned space ships yet." How are you so sure?

COLONEL TACKER: Because to date, said, there is no evidence to substantiate such a fantastic claim.

DAVIS: Well, you tell us a lot of reports that are unexplained and this is the way you list them in your book. What about the unexplained ones, the unknown ones?

COLONEL TACKER: Well, the unknown or unexplained cases in the last few years have run about two per cent of the total number of sightings; and in most of these instances the Air Force feels that if more immediate data had been gathered initially at the scene of the sighting, these too could have been explained.

However, we can't go along with the theory of the UFO groups and many of the persons associated with these groups that because we have not come up with a definite answer in a very few cases, that this is an argument for the existence of space ships.

GORRICK: Well Colonel Tacker, what do most of these sightings turn out to be?
