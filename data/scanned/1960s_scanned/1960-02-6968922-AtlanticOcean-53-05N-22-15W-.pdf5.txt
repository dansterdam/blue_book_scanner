Analysis and Conclusions: The report indicates that the object observed was a bright light moving with great speed for approximately 4-5 seconds. It was approximately 1/4 the size of the moon and exhibited a slow, jerky eastward motion. The observer, Barker, was unable to identify the object conclusively, but did rule out some potential explanations such as satellites, astronomical phenomena, and normal aircraft. The overall reliability of the source is considered poor.
