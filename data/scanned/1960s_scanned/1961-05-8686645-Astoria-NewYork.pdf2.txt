32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high on the object you see. Then, draw a line from the point "A" to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it. For a smaller sketch as an example, if the object is smaller than the example, draw it in approximately the same relative size.
