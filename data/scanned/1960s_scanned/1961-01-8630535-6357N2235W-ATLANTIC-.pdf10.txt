PAGE FIVE RJDIKF:
IMPRESSED AT THE OBJECTS BRIGHTNESS AND VERY HIGH ALTITUDE. THEY STATED TO THE BEST OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE THE OBJECT MOVED VERY SLIGHTLY DURING THE 5 MINUTES THEY SAW IT. OBSERVERS DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE OBJECT COULD HAVE BEEN A BALLOON BUT ITS VERY HIGH ALTITUDE, IT BRIGHTNESS, AND THEIR NOT HAVING SEEN A BALLOON QUITE LIKE IT, ASTOUNDED THEM THE OBJECT WAS NOT PURSUED BY THEM. DUE TO THEIR AIRCRAFT BEING LOW ON FUEL, BOTH OBSERVERS WERE VERY SINCERE AND COOPERATIVE IN RELATING ALL INFORMATION THEY HAD ON THE SIGHTING. THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED ON THE BASIS OF THE INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS SUPPLIED BY THE BASE WEATHER DETACHMENT- NO FURTHER FACTS ARE KNOWN AT THIS TIME CONCERNING THIS SIGHTING OR WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN.
