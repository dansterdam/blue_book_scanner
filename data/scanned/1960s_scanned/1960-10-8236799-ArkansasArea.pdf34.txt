The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a report, likely from Project Blue Book, that describes an observation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in Arkansas on October 19, 1960. The text indicates that a group of disc-shaped objects were sighted in the sky and that the UFO was undulating as it rotated around its axis, and the objects' positioning constantly changed in relation to each other.
