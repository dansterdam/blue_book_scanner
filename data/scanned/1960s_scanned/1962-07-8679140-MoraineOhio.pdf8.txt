The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon, and instructions to mark points "A" and "B" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when it was first seen and when it was last seen. The second sketch shows two larger sketches, one of a landscape with a person standing in the foreground, and another smaller sketch showing a silhouetted object against the horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch on an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
