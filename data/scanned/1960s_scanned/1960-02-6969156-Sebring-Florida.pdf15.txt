Sebring, Florida, February 6th, 1960

Shortly after 6:00 P.M. on February 6, 1960, I was in my back yard, Sebring, Florida, when I saw what appeared to be a strange object in the sky. At first, I thought it was an airplane, but it was traveling at a much higher speed than any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. It was very brightly lit and seemed to change colors as it moved across the sky. It appeared to be circular in shape and was traveling in a straight line. As it moved, it seemed to fluctuate in brightness, sometimes becoming very bright and at other times dimmer. 

The object was visible for approximately two to three minutes before disappearing from sight. I immediately called my neighbor, Mr. John Doe, who also witnessed the object. We both observed it for the entire time it was visible. The object made no sound whatsoever. 

After it disappeared, I began to think about what I had seen. I have never witnessed anything like this before. I can only describe it as a very bright, circular object that appeared to change colors as it moved across the sky at a very high rate of speed. It was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen.

I would be happy to provide any further information or answer any questions you may have about this incident. Please let me know if you require any additional details.

Sincerely,
