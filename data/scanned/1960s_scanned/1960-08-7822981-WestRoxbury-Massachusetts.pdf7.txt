14 October 1960

Dear Mr. [redacted],

The report of an unidentified flying object you gave to the 8th District Air Force Base, McGuire Air Force Base, is scheduled for analysis and/or evaluation. 

It is a matter of the Aero-Space Technical Intelligence Center that you probably observed a meteor. The absence of a trail indicates that this is more likely to have been a meteor or a small satellite, and the multiple illumination spots left are faint and can only be seen with an optical aid. Further, the motion was smooth and did not very possibly and may not denture look.

It is improbable that you saw the flame from a jet aircraft, first because this flame is not produced by blue, and second, it would not be very bright from the 500 vantage point enjoyed by you in viewing this phenomenon.

You also included a newspaper article concerning the objects described in your letter. While this case was open, but in view of the above information, it was considered that the high flying jet aircraft.

Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER
