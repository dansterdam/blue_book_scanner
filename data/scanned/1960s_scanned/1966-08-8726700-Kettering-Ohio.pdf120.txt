Transcribing the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that the object you saw was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show where you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
