OCT. 29, 1960 CRESSY, LAUNCETON, AUSTRALIA
AT 10:50 P.M. LOCAL STANDARD TIME. WITNESSES CLARENCE L. METCALFE, WATCHING TELEVISION AT THE TIME. SAID HE FELT A PECULIAR SENSATION OF UNEASINESS AND RESTLESSNESS, AND IT REALLY FELT AS IF THE HOUSE WAS CHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY - SO MUCH SO THAT HIS MOTHER AND NEIGHBORS MR. AND MRS. T. GALBRAITH DISCOVERED A TICKING SOUND. FOUNDATION -- SOME OF THEIR FLOOR BOARDS WERE LIFTED OFF ITSELF. METCALFE WENT OUTSIDE AND NEIGHBORS MR. AND MRS. K. G. WOODWARD DISCOVERED A GLOWING RED BALL COVERING ABOVE WESTERN TREES. A LITTLE TO THE SOUTH OF EASTMAN. AT THE SAME TIME, THE BALL SEEMED TO STAY IN THE SAME POSITION BUT SWELLED AND SHRANK IN SIZE AS I WATCHED IT. AFTER A MINUTE AND A HALF OR A LITTLE LONGER, THEN IT SEEMED TO GO OUT RATHER THAN MOVE AWAY. WOODWARD STATED, WAS SOON AS SENSATION AS IT DISAPPEARED, THE GROUND SEEMED TO BOTH FELT A MOST PECULIAR EXPLOSION. AT FIRST WOODWARD THOUGHT AN AIR PRESSURE HAD BUILT UP AND THE GROUND JUST COLLAPSED. ALL AROUND US â€” THEN CAME THE TERRIFIC SHOCK AND THE GROUND SEEMED TO BE ON FIRE. ITS EXHAUST, BUT HE NOTICED THE DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AVIATION AT LAUNCETON AIRPORT AND RECEIVED A NEGATIVE ANSWER. AN INSPECTOR WHO ALSO REPORTED HEARING AND FEELING THE EXPLOSION, HAD EXPERIENCED A SIMILAR PHENOMENON AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE SIGHTING ON OCTOBER 3. ALSO AT CRESSY (G.V.T.).
