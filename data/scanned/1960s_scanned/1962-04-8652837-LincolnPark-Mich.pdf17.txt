The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

WAS MUCH LARGER THAN TYPE DOF MATCH HEAD. IT APPEARED TO BE LONG IN LINE WITH KNOWN OBJECT AND HOW MUCH OF IT WAS COVERED BY HEAD OF MATCH. IF YOU HAD PERFORMED THIS EXPERIMENT AT TIME OF SIGHTING, HOW MUCH OF OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY MATCH HEAD?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

DISAPPEARED BUT CAME BACK AGAIN

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you observed.

IT WAS A ROUND OBJ CT ABOUT HALF THE SIZE OF A FULL MOON. IT HAD AN ORANGE SMOKEY GLOW AROUND IT AND SEEMED TO HAVE NO SHARP EDGES BUT WAS QUITE SOLID IN APPEARANCE.
