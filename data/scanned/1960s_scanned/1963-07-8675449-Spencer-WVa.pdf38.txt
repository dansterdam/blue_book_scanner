NOTES ON THE DUFTON FELL GRATE
JOHN BAINBRIDGE

The Chilton crater was reported fully in the September-October issue of FLYING SAUCER REVIEW, Vol. 8, No. 2 (which is devoted to crater reports, but the present instance is briefly reported in the World Round Up section. Here is a fuller report by a local investigator.

Location and approach.-Dufton Fell in North Westmoreland. Nearest approach by car from the south around Stanley Dymond. More than 10 miles from Appleby. From the car take the winding road past Stanley Dymond side into the fell. The actual main area is then about a mile from this point.

Description of valley and crater.- A shallow natural valley, sides averaging about 15-2o deg. The central area, about 100 yards across, is more or less level with scattered rocks and boulders. Here the gathering ground for the UFOs appears to have been. Beyond this area, on the north side, the valley suddenly deepens and becomes more steep-sided, especially in the north-east section. The two craters are clearly visible across the hillside, some 300 yards apart, rather larger than their dimensions indicate. Their separation from the buildings, presently and a half mile distant, appears very definite. The floors of the craters are approximately 10 feet deep and roughly circular, the material thrown out lies in scalloped ridges some 20 yards from the crater edges.

The craters.-There are two of them, each about 100 yards in diameter, with the nearest some 300 yards apart. All this area is gently sloping, nearly level, and the craters are more or less identical, save that one is rather deeper than the other. Their rims almost meet at the highest points but shallow troughs or gullies run down to the valley floor at the bottom of the slope. These run down to the valley floor and from which had a appearance of water drainage, very much greater in area of damage. From the actual impact to the edge of the debris could be 10-15 yards across. The gullies are at most half a mile wide.

Characteristics.--The crater floors are flat, or slightly saucer-shaped, the rims are not high, merely a low circular wall, 3-4 feet in height. The inner sides slope gently down to the crater floor, not a sheer drop. The material thrown out consists of crumbled rock, breaking down into smaller fragments and soil washed down into the gullies below. There were no signs of burning, no smell, nor any signs of radioactivity. The crater floors were damp but not wet.

Damage.--The whole area of the craters is devoid of vegetation, shrubs and grasses. This applies also to the gullies and valleys which run off from the craters themselves. Some few yards beyond the crater edges the vegetation and grass is normal and undamaged. There were no signs of any marks on the surrounding hill slopes, and no disturbance to sheep or other livestock or damage to land or buildings. The general impression given was of two shallow saucer-shaped cavities formed by some explosive force or displacement of material rather than by burning or melting.
