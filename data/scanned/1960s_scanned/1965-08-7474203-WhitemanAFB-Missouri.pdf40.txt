AIR FORCE INVESTIGATORS CHECKING REPORT
Counly Youth Snaps Whether you were in some distant
and tll some small county was
exciting phenomenon
unexpected or unintelligible to you,
or whether seemingly outlandish
reports of happenings or objects
sometimes from a nearby county
seem unbelievable - try to withhold judgment until the available
facts are assembled and weighed.
Our investigators have begun
checking this latest report from the
Beaver Valley Times, Beaver Falls,
Pa., of August 26, 1965, which de-
scribes the experience of three
Beaver County youths who saw
what they believe was a flying saucer
near Aliquippa, Pa. While the
investigators' report is not yet complete, some details have become
available.
JAMES LUCAS, aged 10, Greg a
Eakin, aged 11, and Mark Rogers,
aged 12, claimed that they saw a
strange object in the sky over
Aliquippa, Pa., about 11:20 p.m.
on August 23, 1965. They said the
object appeared to be hovering and
rotating, and that it had a flashing
light. When they tried to get a
closer look, the object then ap-
peared to speed away. The youths
told their story to local newspapers
and radio stations in the area.
One of the most interesting
items in the investigators' report
is a photographic enlargement
which seems to show the object the
youths saw, looking much like a
flying saucer. The enlargement was
made from a photograph taken by
one of the youths, James Lucas.
According to the report, the
youths' descriptions of the object
seem reasonably consistent and
credible to the investigators. While
the photographic enlargement does
not conclusively prove the existence
of the reported object, it does tend
to corroborate the accounts given
by the youths. The investigating
team plans to continue its inquiry.
