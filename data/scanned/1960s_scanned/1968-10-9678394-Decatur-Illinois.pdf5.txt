Dear [redacted],

My name is [redacted] and I live at [redacted], Decatur, Illinois. I have written to you before and you may remember that I reported seeing an unidentified flying object on [redacted]. That sighting was investigated by your Project Blue Book and I understand it was classified as an "unknown."

On the evening of [redacted], at approximately [redacted], I observed another unidentified flying object in the sky. This object was larger and brighter than the one I saw before, and it remained visible for a much longer period of time. I watched it for over [redacted] minutes before it disappeared.

The object seemed to be under intelligent control and was maneuvering in a way that could not be explained by any conventional aircraft. It made several abrupt turns and changes in speed that would not be possible for a normal airplane or helicopter.

I am writing to you again in the hope that this latest sighting will be thoroughly investigated by your Project Blue Book staff. I would be glad to provide any additional details or information that might be helpful.

Sincerely,
[redacted]
