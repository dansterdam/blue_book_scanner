1. Discussion for your letter concerning Dr. J. Allen Hynek and his availability as a guest speaker. However, we cannot schedule a guest speaker at this time due to the pending move of our training activity to Lowry AFB. We are interested in Dr. Hynek and will need to leave the arrangement procedure for future planning. Please forward to this information including our interest.

2. We appreciate your sending the UFO material.
