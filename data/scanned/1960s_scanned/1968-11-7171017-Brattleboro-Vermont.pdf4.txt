Transcription of the text in the document:

We watched a stationary light startled the sight up the area.
My sister and her daughter have made several sightings in july and august- observing the fact twelve years.
But during the last fifteen minutes the U.F.O. has become much more numerous and all new- a more sophisticated one.
We feel that we are under constant surveillance. There are a small one followed me.
I my clear night they can be seen from home which dominate the wide vicinity of the sky with a low altitude.
