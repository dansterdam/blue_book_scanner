September 21, 1967
Dear Sir,
Your letter, several weeks old, comes to me accidentally. It is quite true that I myself was present to this affair - my observations were not very fruitful however. There seemed to me to be a certain confusion - some say this, some say that. But quite honestly, I do not feel that I have much to add to what has already been said and written about this business. Observations were few and far between and I have not followed the case with the interest some may have done. I felt it was something of a tempest in a teapot so to speak and did not pursue it. But you may feel free to inform me if you develop any new information which may seem worthy of my attention. Thank you for writing.
Sincerely yours.
