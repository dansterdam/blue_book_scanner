The image does not contain a photograph. The document appears to be a report form from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to study unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The form includes instructions to "Draw a picture that will show the shape of the phenomenon" and provides space for the witness to describe the observed phenomenon. The witness has written a description, which reads: "Very bright and a bright glow. On Oct. 6, 1967 a red flashing came. There was a intersection light case so bright it appeared fuzzy as if the white fuzzy glow". The form also includes a section for "Angular Size", which has been left blank.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:
