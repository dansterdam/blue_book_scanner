The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document or report, likely from Project Blue Book, discussing an encounter with unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

AN ENCOUNTER
Page 13-

The following are the important things I have almost never seen mentioned or observed:

/ that first, there is not just one or two UFOs counted, as many as seven hanging around the horizon though they were stars or the first magnitude dazzling I have seen as many as six smaller dimmer ones which hover low in the skies. There may be a lot more, but this is the maximum count that I actually sight. All move at tremendous speeds but also a certain amount of undulation. They can turn and seem to disappear completely, but I have never seen them come back. Occasionally, they will just move above the path of flight, and sometimes they will follow for a while as if pacing the observer.

/ that secondly, they themselves can imitate a large, disc-shaped plane with the usual red and green lights, but with sound. I have seen a large, disc-move rapidly and glow outlining its shape when just overhead become a "jet" with running exhaust fumes streaming from its rear and with deafening whine of an actual jet, however, it is to be able to distinguish its undulation. Also a cylindrically shaped "plane" which looks like plane of earlier times and sounds like one is simply too big to be powered by any motor appear day or night out of nowhere. It has for me to see that it has no markings of any a dark stripe at its wingline. On bright days, it seems shiny too big to be some experimental aircraft.
