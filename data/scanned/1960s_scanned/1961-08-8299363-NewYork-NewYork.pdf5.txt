1. The photographic prints and negatives have been examined,
with the following results:
a. Photo Nr. 1: the image marked as a sea gull is a break
or scratch in the negative emulsion while the other objects are
the natural cry-stization patterns in the film's process.
b. Photos 2 and 3: the white objects indicated by arrows
are real images and the smatlion destruction at the time of processing.
c. Photo Nr. 4: on this photograph the white images are
sharply while the dark areas of the photograph is out of focus. No
corresponding images can be seen on the negative; and the white
objects may have been produced by the gaseous emission of foreign matter
in the film.
2. The unidentified objects are the result of poor quality
photo development.
