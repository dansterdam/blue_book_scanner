Concerning explanations, project it could not havo been an aircraft because the object did not change in size as it came closer. It appeared to be over a mile in altitude as it passed over at an estimated ground speed of 300 to 600 miles per hour. It was not a weather balloon because it was not affected by the wind which was about 15 mph out of the southwest at the time. It did not have the characteristics of a satellite or meteor. I was in the military at the time and have had experience in identifying all types of aircraft, missiles, and satellites, and I am convinced that what I saw was not of this world. The behavior and characteristics of the object were such that it could only be classified as an unidentified flying object.
