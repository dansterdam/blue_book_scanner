The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, likely describing a UFO sighting.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

"I also discussed a bright light in the sky which I had seen while flying earlier. This light appeared to be hovering and then quickly darted away. I felt this was a UFO. I was the only person who saw this light. Since no one else had seen it, I did not feel I could make a definite identification as to what this light was.

I recommend that any further investigative action or reports of objects displayed by this witness be followed up promptly. His future investigative action or reports of UFO's should be given the fullest possible attention.
