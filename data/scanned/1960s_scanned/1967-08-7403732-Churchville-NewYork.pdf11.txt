Transcription of the text:

"Slid out the bear cub, just went the streets a-jumping up and down the skyl I threatened to punch the trashman who lives with a canning army. Shut that is bad for it was a recluse and a grading enemy. 

About 4:45 P.M. the skies opened up, many people, including me, received a very bright light, severe enough to blind me for about 5 seconds. Same phenomenon occurred yesterday in the same area. From all accounts, it seems to me from the same object that appeared yesterday. 

Some said that it might have been a missile test. I must now ask the president (if he will listen) the rest of my life. I want to come to grabs with this matter which as I said before is intriguing to our country. So Mr President, if you would please for me to be certain to Washington D.C.? Sooner would not be too early for when the comet gets in, we want me to appear before the public should my story be acceptional with what I say. Sincerely, The shape, size etc."
