The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which is a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page includes a form with various fields related to sighting conditions, weather, and observations. The bottom portion of the form contains a handwritten description of a sighting, which mentions a "point of light" that appeared to be a "white light", and it was described as being "stable" and "motionless".
