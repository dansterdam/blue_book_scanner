SO NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "o" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "o" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "O" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE PHENOMENON. THIS SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM IS USED TO SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECT VISUAL DATA, AND EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
