The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn diagram and handwritten text. The diagram appears to show a UFO sighting, with a circular object labeled "UFO SIGHTING" and various annotations describing the sighting, such as "East or pas 52" and "Vapour or exhaust from aircraft".

The handwritten text provides additional details about the sighting, including the date "RT 87" and a note that the sighting was "for about 30-60 seconds (or approx. 1 min.)".
