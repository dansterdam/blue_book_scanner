The object hovered for a few minutes, then moved away to the Southwest at a high rate of speed, disappearing from sight.

The witnesses are considered reliable, and there is no indication that they were mistaken in their observation.

As described, the appearance is suggestive of a description of something in the sky which appears to be intelligently controlled. The details given indicate a bright, white, oval or spherical object, size of a tangerine, which hovered for about 10 mins and then departed at high speed. This is similar to many sightings of unidentified flying objects. While the description given is not detailed enough to permit a conclusive identification, it is sufficient to warrant the classification of "Unidentified" and the inclusion of this report in Project Blue Book files.
