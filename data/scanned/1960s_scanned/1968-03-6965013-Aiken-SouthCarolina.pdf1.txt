COMMENTS: The reporting officer stated that a DC-9 jet flight from Columbia to Atlanta might have caused the observation. The observer was asked to complete a Form 117 but refused. There is not enough descriptive data on the characteristics of the sighting. The cause of the object, altitude and elevation at the beginning of the sighting is not given.
