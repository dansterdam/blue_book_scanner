MEMORANDUM FOR CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY DIVISION, USAF

SUBJECT: Proposed Reply to [redacted]

The April 12th, 1962 event noted by [redacted] was thoroughly investigated by this Division and other appropriate government agencies. The investigation reveals that the several well-known individuals in the [redacted] area have, at different times, reported their observation of strange objects or lights in the sky. 

A detailed study of the descriptions have lead to the conclusion that the objects were a probable natural phenomena and not of extraterrestrial origin. The numerous reports gathered by the Air Force investigators do not provide evidence that would justify a further investigation under Project Blue Book procedures. 

The colored radar target reported and the 'lights' observed were determined by the Air Force investigators to be consistent with the appearances of distant aircraft lights or natural atmospheric disturbances. Interviews of the various witnesses indicated their probable location to be at a greater distance from the observers than was reported.
