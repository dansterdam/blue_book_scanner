Dear Mr. [redacted],

I sincerely regret the delay in evaluating your unidentified flying object sighting. Due to the amount of mail, sightings, etc. per to this subject, we have created quite a backlog.

Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has evaluated your sighting as ASTROIDENTICAL (NATURAL). I have enclosed your negative and also a copy of the photo analysis.

I wish you for reporting your sighting to the Air Force. It is my duty that circumstances precluded our answering you more promptly.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
