The sighted at about 6:15 p.m. on April 4, 1961 while driving west on U.S. Highway 14 near Sheridan, Wyoming. The object was first observed approximately 9 miles west of Sheridan, Wyoming and was seen for about 3 minutes.

The object was described as round and silver in color. It appeared to be rotating clockwise and at times would appear to vibrate or oscillate. The object was estimated to be about 80-100 feet in diameter and was flying at an estimated altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the ground. The object was observed to be flying in a straight and level course at a speed estimated to be 500-700 mph. 

The weather at the time was clear with unlimited visibility. The object was observed by two military personnel, one an officer and one an enlisted man. Both stated that the object was unlike any aircraft they had ever seen before. After about 3 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated and rapidly disappeared from sight to the west.
