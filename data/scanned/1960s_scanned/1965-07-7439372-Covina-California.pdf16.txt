The image does not contain a photograph. The page appears to be a handwritten note that says "Enclosed is a picture of myself" at the top, followed by the text "Send back the one I don't need it for F.D. THANKYOR 16".

Here is the transcription of the text from the document:

Enclosed is a picture of myself.

Send back the one I don't need it for F.D. THANKYOR 16
