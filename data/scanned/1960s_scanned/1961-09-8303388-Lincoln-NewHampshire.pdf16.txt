ITEM REPORTED: A luminous object with brilliancy greater than surrounding stars.

DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: A luminous object, considerably brighter than surrounding stars, was observed moving in the southern portion of the sky for approximately 15 minutes. The object appeared to move erratically, waver and change direction. It was observed through 7x50 binoculars.

Approximately 2 minutes after the object was first observed, another luminous object appeared in the southern portion of the sky and moved in a generally southeast direction. This object appeared to be considerably smaller and dimmer than the first object.

After the initial observation of the two objects, the larger and brighter object continued to be observed for approximately 13 minutes before disappearing from view. The smaller object was observed for less than 5 minutes before disappearing from view. Both objects were observed to be silent.

IDENTIFICATION: Insufficient information available to make a positive identification of the objects observed.
