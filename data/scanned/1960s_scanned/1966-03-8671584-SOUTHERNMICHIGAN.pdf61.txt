DISPOSITION: FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND SEARCH OF THE AREA WAS MADE WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS.
STATUS: U CLOSED OPEN

Mr. [REDACTED], the complainant, is the son-in-law of Mr. [REDACTED] who made the original sighting. Mr. [REDACTED] was about to enter his house from a front yard, when, according to him, he noticed a bright light out of the corner of his eye. He thought at first it was a setting star which he said immediately stopped and then over a period of five to seven minutes, the object was maneuvered south of his home where it hovered and then vanished. Mr. [REDACTED] called his son-in-law, the complainant, from the house to watch the sighting and together they watched the glow of light behind the trees. Apparently at this time Mr. [REDACTED] made the report to the Sherriff's office. Deputy Fitzpatrick and Airman Kelley were dispatched to the area and in an interview with Mr. [REDACTED] and particularly with his son-in-law, the complainant, the complaint stated that upon arrival at the farm house, Mr. [REDACTED] and Liaison were already making a trek to the swamp area to look in an attempt to locate the "object". [REDACTED] and his son did not carry an lights, gave a cigarette lighter (it seems strange since the night was dark, being the new Moon) The Deputies thereupon proceeded to the point marked A on figure #1, where they parked their car. They then proceeded towards the glowing along a path marked by a dotted line (a path which I almost exactly repeated on Wednesday, 23 March in the company of Deputy Fitzpatrick and Airman Kelley, to point B). From point B, Deputy Fitzpatrick and Airman Kelley continued the search, but the lights disappeared and were not observed again. Further search of the area was made with negative results.
