The image does not appear to contain any photograph or visual element, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will proceed to transcribe the text found in the document:

Very handsome and 28 by 32 inches, formed of a metal disk 1 1/2 inches in thickness with a circular depression in the center. The rim encircling the depression is rised about 3/4 inches above the surround surface and is about 2 inches wide. The depression itself is about 20 inches in diameter and about 1 inch deep. The whole object weighs about 25 pounds. The exterior finish appears to be a dark, dull gunmetal color.
