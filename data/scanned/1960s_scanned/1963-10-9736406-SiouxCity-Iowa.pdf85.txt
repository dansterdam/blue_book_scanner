A SAUCER RING, ABOUT 23 FEET IN DIAMETER, WAS OBSERVED NEAR SIOUX CITY, IOWA ON 9 OCTOBER 1963. THE OBJECT WAS ALSO REPORTED BY THE SIOUX CITY AUTHORITIES. IT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 700 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.

THE WITNESS, WHO HAS REQUESTED THAT HIS NAME BE WITHHELD, STATED THAT HE WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK WHEN HE NOTICED THE OBJECT IN THE SKY. HE SAID IT WAS ROTATING SLOWLY AND GIVING OFF A BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT. AFTER WATCHING IT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES, IT SUDDENLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

THE WITNESS DID NOT HEAR ANY SOUND COMING FROM THE OBJECT. HE SAID IT WAS ABOUT 700 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 23 FEET IN DIAMETER. THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 1 MILE FROM THE WITNESS' LOCATION.

THE WITNESS STATED THAT HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED BY WHAT HE SAW AND COULD NOT BELIEVE HIS EYES. HE SAID HE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE SIOUX CITY AUTHORITIES, WHO CONFIRMED THAT THEY TOO HAD OBSERVED THE OBJECT.
