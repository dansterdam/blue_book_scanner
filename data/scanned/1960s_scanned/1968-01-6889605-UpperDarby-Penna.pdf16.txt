"CASE IDENTIFICATION: CASE NO. F-1006-68 LOCATION: UPPER DARBY, PA. DATE: 1-6-68

SPECIAL INVESTIGATION REPORT:

DATE OF SIGHTING: 1-6-68 TIME: 8:15 PM EST DURATION: 3-4 MINUTES WITNESS: MRS. GERTRUDE M. WALLING, 7336 RADBOURNE RD., UPPER DARBY, PA. PHONE: LE 4-1883

DETAILS OF SIGHTING: MRS. WALLING STATED THAT SHE OBSERVED IN THE SKY TO THE NORTH, WHAT APPEARED TO BE 3 BRIGHT LIGHTS IN A HORIZONTAL CONFIGURATION. SHE WENT ON TO STATE THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE EXACT SHAPE OR SIZE OF THE OBJECT DUE TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LIGHTS. MRS. WALLING SAID THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOTIONLESS AND WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 3-4 MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. SHE ADDED THAT NEAR THE END OF THE SIGHTING THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BECOME DIMMER.

The recent case was a while ago and I don't recall many specific details about it. As I can see from the report, the witness observed bright lights in the sky that appeared to be in a horizontal configuration. The object was difficult to determine the exact shape or size of due to the brightness of the lights, but it seemed to be motionless and was observed for around 3-4 minutes before disappearing from view, with the object appearing to become dimmer near the end of the sighting."
