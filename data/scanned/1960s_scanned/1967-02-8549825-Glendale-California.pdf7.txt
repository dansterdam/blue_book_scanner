17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Heard nothing
b. Color: Off-white seems to have lost passenger plane

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the match it covers. Do this quickly, but this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Do not give exact angular measurement, but this will give us a fair estimate. This experiment is long on the 70's. DO NOT TRY THIS AFTER THE OCCURRENCE

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
There are no wings, small box or house on rear-no smoke-no noise.
