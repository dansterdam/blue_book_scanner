MEMO FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: UFO REPORTS, Wash D C area, 23 AUG 67
Lt Nielsen of Andrews AFB, Ohio spoke with a witness regarding additional information he had been able to gather on the sightings made in the Washington D C area on 22 August 67. Lt Nielsen checked with the D C police department and Ft Melington police department. They were negative, no enforcement observed a UFO nor did anyone turn in a balloon. Lt Nielsen also talked to a private citizen and he told Lt Nielsen that he was standing in downtown Georgetown and there was a policeman on the corner who was also watching this object. Lt Nielsen has been unable to get in touch with the policeman, however, he comes on duty at 1300 and he will try to reach him then.
Lt Nielsen also spoke with Lt Col Bunita who is with the Scientific and Technical Division of DIA. Lt Col Bunita said that based on everything he has seen and heard the object was most probably a surface balloon with some kind of light tied onto it.
I also asked Lt Nielsen if everyone reported that the color was red and he said yes.
Lt Nielsen said that he had previously checked National Airport, which would have been in the area, to see if any of their pilots had observed the UFO. However, Lt Nielsen said he could personally check each airline if one of their pilots had observed the UFO if Major Quintanilla would want him to do so. I informed Lt Nielsen that would call him back in approximately 24 hours.
