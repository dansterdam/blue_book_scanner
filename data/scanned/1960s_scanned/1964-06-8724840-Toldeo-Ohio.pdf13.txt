Dear Dr. Hynek,

Finally! The photos are numbered on the back. I hope some of them will prove interesting. They were taken on the day, I am afraid, that the photographer (alleged with half-hearted camera) was underexposed.

Between 2 and 3 are a few taken from close up where I first sighted the objects. (These numbers 1, 2, and 3 correspond to those on the other type numbered photos.) I can't seem to see the objects. Picture number 4 taken later shows nothing but the objects have finally dissolved. The effects finally formed and disappeared. Please let me know if you may have any comments.

Sincerely,

The text in the image is the handwritten letter described above. There are no other textual elements present in the image.
