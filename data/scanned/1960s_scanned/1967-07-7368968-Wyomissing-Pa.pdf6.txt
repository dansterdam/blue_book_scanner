The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten letter on the letterhead of "Howard Bond" addressed to "Dear Sirs". The letter describes the author's observation of a UFO flying over Berks County, Pennsylvania on a particular night. The author mentions seeing the UFO from their balcony and describes its movements and characteristics.

Here is the text of the letter transcribed:

Dear Sirs,
I am out on the balcony where I saw the U.F.O. According to the neighbors, I am facing North (9'9" facing the same spot that I saw the U.F.O.) As we (my mother & I) glanced over, the starry sky we noticed directly over head (a bit to the left of the star) the moving U.F.O. It kept going east as until it got out of sight. May I also tell you direct several hundred people saw this same U.F.O. The same night all over Berks County.
