They have not sized the object yet but they will send us the report as soon as they do. The size in the USO picture is a quite small one and was only very tiny invebible but could not be as large as a frisbee. The other boy was in the area because he was brought in a car to near the spot and then left. The contect used is an ordinary wooden college.
