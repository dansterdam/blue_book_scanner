"..talk. The matter is something like this. About the last of June 1962, I and one other person were driving around in the country near Brewster, Ohio searching for what we thought was unusual information. We have been interested in the UFO phenomenon for some time and frequently go out to spots where they have been reported thinking we may see something ourselves.

The morning I can recollect was a clear, sunny day and we were driving along a country road north of Brewster when we noticed something in the sky that appeared to be unusual. It seemed to be hovering and moving about in a rather erratic manner. We stopped the car and watched it for some time. It appeared to be a metallic, disk-like object reflecting the sunlight. It seemed to be about the size of a large automobile and was several hundred feet in the air.

We watched it for some time and finally it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from sight. The whole observation lasted about 10 to 15 minutes.
