Gentlemen,
May we draw your attention to the following event:
Today, Sunday, December 18, at 4:20 P.M. we sighted an object moving across the sky. The object was length about 4-5 feet, a distance from each other and were moving in a straight line to the northeast. The local direction was about Kentucky - southeast. It was a clear, sunny afternoon, and the brilliant objects were visible for about 4-5 minutes.
We are sure that these were not ordinary aircraft, and the brilliant objects passed the usual aircraft appearance.
Yours sincerely
Cincinnati, Ohio
