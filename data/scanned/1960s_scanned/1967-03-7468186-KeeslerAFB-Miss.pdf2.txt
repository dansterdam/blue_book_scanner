Unfortunately, there is no photograph or image present in this page of the old UFO report document. The document appears to be a text-based Air Force message with details related to a UFO report, including information about an "ELONGATED FIREBALL", an "ENGINE AIRLINER", and an "ORANGE-YELLOWISH FLAME". I have extracted all the text from the document and provided it below:
