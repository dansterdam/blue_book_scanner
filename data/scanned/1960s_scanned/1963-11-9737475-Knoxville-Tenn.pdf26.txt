Dear Mr. X,

This is in reply to your letter of December 2, 1963, in which you request information concerning the objects observed over Knoxville, Tennessee, on December 15.

The material reported is attributed to a meteor. Contrary to information given you in my letter of December 18, further analysis reveals that this was a satellite decay (or re-entry) rather than sighting of an unknown object. The observational data indicate that the colors, forms, and movements observed were consistent with a satellite decay rather than the sighting of an unknown object. 

The Sputnik IV decay on September 5, 1962 was in approximately the same general area and similar to the displays occasionally observed associated with the decay of orbiting objects as they re-enter the atmosphere. The above is given as the most logical explanation for the sighting in view of the observational data available.

Sincerely,
MAFTON M. JACOBS
