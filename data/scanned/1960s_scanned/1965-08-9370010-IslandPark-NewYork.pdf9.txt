UFO SIGHTINGS, 21 AUGUST 1965

1. REFERENCE the unidentified observation of 21 August 1965. Analysis has been completed on these negatives which were forwarded to the office of SD on 1 Aug 65. We are returning the original negatives.

2. The following is extracted from the photo analysis report:

The UFO in question cannot be identified beyond the fact that it is considered to be of light source. The shape, color and movement are characteristic of single-engine fighter-type aircraft or possible swamp gas phenomena. The blue-white lights on the object were probably caused by tungsten-type lights, while the slow movement and intermittent lighting is indicative of real aircraft rather than anything more unusual. The movement of the camera through a normal lens causing an irregular image is the suspected cause of the irregular lights. The object was observed for a maximum 30 seconds. Negatives indicated luminance between 24 and 30 exposures on each negative. Based on the details on the negatives, we have no reason to request any further examination.
