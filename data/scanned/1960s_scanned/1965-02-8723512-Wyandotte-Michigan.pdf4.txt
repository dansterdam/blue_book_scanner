The image contains a page from an old UFO report document, which appears to be part of Project Blue Book. The page contains a sketch showing a compass-like diagram with angles and instructions for describing the location of a UFO sighting. There is also a prompt for the viewer to draw a picture showing the motion and direction of the UFO object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the dashed line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
