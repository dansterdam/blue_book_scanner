The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads as follows:

The Winnipeg papers were called, but this being Saturday afternoon, and neither paper putting out a Sunday edition, no information was available.

Mr. Hove was contacted on Sunday; he got his radar information from the witness.

The Winnipeg Tribune found the story about an attempt to generate a man-made aurora; the test took place in northern Ontario on July 20th.

No subsequent reports of rocket tests were found.

Through the Roseau, Minnesota Times-Region, contact was made with _______ who together with another couple saw a phenomenon having the same description as the others, but their time-estimates are somewhat off. The line of sight is fairly well established, and indicates that the event was farther north than thought up to this point.

At this time enough leads had been accumulated to attempt to locate the position of the object. When appropriate times of sight were drawn on a map, the sightings being used in which there appeared to be at least some reliability to the estimate of direction, it became apparent that the object had been far to the north of the U.S.-Canada border. Furthermore, from the fact that the object had been seen low in the sky by _______ who was flying at 5000 feet, it was apparent that the object must have been at least 500 miles above the ground, in order to be seen over the horizon.

The lines of sight had a great deal of scatter, so it was decided to request (on behalf of Dearborn Observatory) reports from other witnesses. Half a dozen newspapers were contacted and requested to run an announcement.
