Gentlemen:

I have a good friend at Eastern Mennonite College in Harrisonburg, Virginia who on December 23, 1963 experienced an U.F.O. sighting. He told me the following:

He was driving on the highway between Staunton and Harrisonburg when he saw what he thought was a large aircraft, but as he drifted to a stop the object passed directly overhead, circling the highway about 175 feet in diameter. He judged the object to be about 125 feet in diameter.

I have no more details and what happened after. However, he said it set there about two minutes and left at a terrific speed toward the mountain at a terrific rate. The speed was so great the motor seemed to drive away very suddenly. 

This is probably routine to you, but the significant point is...on December 26, 1964 he had him show me the area and we went to the spot. The Geiger counter showed intense radiation where the object was sited for the object was terrific, in my opinion. No doubt the area is still radioactive.

Dr. Ginman did not say what type of rays were present, but this should be of some help to you.
