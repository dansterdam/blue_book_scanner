or sight." As far as Mr **** could estimate the object was at 30 - 40 degrees of elevation. Mr **** said he was fairly good at knowing his angles and elevations he had a course in astronomy, however, that was quite some time ago so he couldn't make any of the stars in the area. What he sighted the object with was a telephone pole that was close by to make his observations because he wanted something permanent so that he could spot it again and give a fairly accurate account. Mr Forr said that the gentleman last night (duty officer) did take a lengthy report. Lt Marano said he would like to get the report in his own handwriting. Mr **** said he hadn't called the newspapers and neither does he believe or disbelieve in UFOs, but this was out of the ordinary. Lt Marano asked Mr **** if the object was as bright as Jupiter? Mr **** said it was sitting between a couple of stars. When I called my daughter (17) and I showed her the general direction and she said two or three stars and that is what it appeared to be to the naked eye. The brightness was similar to that of a star. I gave her the binoculars and then she saw it to. It looked like one of these big dome lights on an emergency vehicle revolving light, it looked similar to this. The light appeared to be of an earth made origin but I couldn't figure out what it would be doing up so high at night. This was my first gathering of what it should be, a helicopter light or something like that. The moon was about 100 - 110 degrees on a circular plane from the object, in other words, the moon was in an ENE location. I have never had a compass out to my house to get a positive location as to what is exactly north and south. There were other stars in the area, they were all dimming because of cloud cover. At approximately 12:30 my daughter and I went out and there were no stars showing.
