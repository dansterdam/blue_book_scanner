Observers watched a formation of approximately 31 objects hovering in the sky, then move towards the north. The objects appeared to be bright, larger than a star, and were as bright as a light bulb. Contact was made with the Air Force Operations in the area. Two KC-135s were over the area at about 4 Oct. 66, but at different locations. The description of the objects did not fit the normal pattern of aircraft reported for a bird.
