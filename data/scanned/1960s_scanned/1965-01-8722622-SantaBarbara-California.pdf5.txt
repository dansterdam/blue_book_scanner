There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to show a page from an old document or report, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

The handwritten text reads:
"It had been foggy, visibility was poor. He came out of the fog around 6:35 pm, it was heading in a northwest direction at an altitude of about 2,000 feet. It appeared to be a metalic [sic] object, about 50-60 feet in diameter, disk shaped, with a slight dome on top. It made no noise and had no visible means of propulsion. It remained in view for about 2 minutes before disappearing back into the fog."
