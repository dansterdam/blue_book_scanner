The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch is a compass rose with the cardinal directions labeled. The smaller sketches depict a person standing in a landscape, with a close-up view of the horizon in the smaller inset sketch.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

IN THE SKETCH BELOW PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A + ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
IN THIS SKETCH PLACE A CROSS (X) AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN AND A PLUS (+) ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
