Mrs Hunt/SAPUCOC/2240/29 Jun 65

Dear Mrs. ____,

This is in reply to your letter concerning unidentified flying objects.

I am enclosing a copy of AFR 200-2 which is used for the investigation of UFO reports. As soon as possible, we will evaluate your report, and you will be informed of the results.

The material that you found in your yard was probably caused by meteorological conditions and did not originate from any UFO. However, I am requesting a laboratory analysis of this material, and the results of this analysis will be furnished to you.

I am also enclosing the standard report form for Project Blue Book. If you wish to submit any additional information, please fill out this form and return it to this office. I hope this report will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
