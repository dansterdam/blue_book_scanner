10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Called to window to observe large ovoid shaped obj. flying at high alt. from north to south. Obj. appeared steady, grey-white color, without observable shape or structure. About 1 degree apparent diameter. Silently flew almost due south on straight course. After 3 minutes, obj. passed out of sight. Obj. appeared luminous internally, giving off no trail or exhaust.
11. COMMENTS. Speed too fast for jet. Size, speed, and maneuverability not consistent with known aircraft. No known natural phenomena can account for visual observations made. This is one of best sightings in this area involving reliable witnesses. Object was tracked on radar by Sault Ste.Marie Air Force Station but was not intercepted. Determination of exact speed, altitude, and size not possible from this observation alone, but all indications are that this was an unconventional flying object of unknown origin. Sighting duration of 3 minutes, observed path and speed, and radar tracking all consistent with each other. This sighting deserves further investigation.
