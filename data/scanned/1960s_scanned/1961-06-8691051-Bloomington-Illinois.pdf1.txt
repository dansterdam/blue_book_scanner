10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING Party saw star-like object moving in a zigzag motion, leaving sometimes a short trail of light. Object appeared to be about the size of a basketball. Proceeded in a straight line at first, then began to zigzag and disappeared from sight. No sound was heard.
11. COMMENTS During investigation, was advised that the object was probably very likely Venus. However, witness felt that it was not Venus as the motion and appearance was completely different from the planet. As insufficient data, and no evidence to conclusively identify the object, case is filed as an UNIDENTIFIED object.
