20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
An angled line like a diagonal movement with the start and end points labeled as "A" and "B".

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
Not specified.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Not specified.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Gradually faded or disappeared from view.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
The trail or movement of the object as described.
