Transcript of the text in the document:

"Sighter Story - The witness, Delila, stated that at about 10:00 P.M. on August 7, 1967, she was sitting on her porch at her home in Homestead, Florida, when she noticed a bright light in the sky. She said the light seemed to be hovering or remaining stationary. She immediately called her husband, Merle, to come and see it. Merle stated that when he came out, the object was still there and appeared to be a bright-white light, larger than a star, but smaller than the moon. It seemed to be about 8 to 10 feet in diameter.

The object remained in view for about 10 to 15 minutes, and then it started moving very rapidly to the east, and in a few seconds it disappeared from view. Delila and Merle both stated that the object made no sound and that it did not appear to have any discernible shape other than a bright-white light. According to the Pennsauken, N.J. report, the couple called the police and the sheriff's office, but no officers were available to come to the scene. Delila and Merle stated that they were both convinced that what they saw was some type of UFO."
