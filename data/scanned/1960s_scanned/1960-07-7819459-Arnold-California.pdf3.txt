...TEST is the incident Richard L. Arnold ( continued) The document describes a sighting that occurred on 21 July 1952, as the Air Force 10.5 report. 
The sighting occurred on 21 July 1952, as reported by Maj. Gen. Albert M. Guidera, Commanding the 4th Air Division, Hamilton Air Force Base, California. He said that on 21 July 1952, he received a report of strange lights in the sky over Mount Rainier, Washington. He immediately dispatched an F-94 jet interceptor to investigate. The pilot made visual contact with the lights, which appeared to be a formation of 5-6 objects, bright reddish-orange in color, and estimated to be about 2500 feet above the ground. The objects were manuvering in a definite formation at an estimated speed of 600 m.p.h.
The pilot fired his jet's afterburners in an effort to close in on the objects, but as he approached them, they suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. The pilot reported that he was not able to get a closer look as the objects moved away from him at a very high rate of speed. 
Since this incident was reported through normal intelligence channels and considered a high priority at the time, it was never brought to the attention of Project Blue Book. If I may be of further assistance, please let me know.
