The witness stated he observed a bluish object that looked like a moon, only brighter. The object was reported to have been hovering near the Corpus Christi and Robstown, Texas area at about 9:30 - 10:00 pm on the night of the report. The witness stated the object's shape varied from round to elongated, and it seemed to disappear toward the Corpus Christi area. No sound was heard, and the object was estimated to be 1 to 2 miles distant and 2,000 to 3,000 feet in altitude. The operations between 2000 and 2100 hrs on the 19th had no unusual activity, and nothing further was sent in addition to return the 2f-16 call.
