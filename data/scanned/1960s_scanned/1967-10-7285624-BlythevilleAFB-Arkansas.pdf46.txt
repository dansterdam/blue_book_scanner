Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

I am writing in reply to your letter of May 16th, and to enclose copies of pilot reports regarding this event.

If you will plot on a map, the positions of these three reports and show plane boundaries THIS of such aircraft involved, you will note that in each case, this aircraft could easily be three sightings of one and the same event.

There is a possibility that this was a large meteor decaying in our atmosphere breaking into two major components. If this is the case, then certainly the event was taking place far to the south of all four (yourselves/sighting included) reports.

These reports do not check out with any known satellites re-entries described at SDC in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Since your inquiry brought to our attention the fact that these were pilot reports, appear to be of some object or event, pointing out at the same time the plausibility of this being a meteor, I have asked a duplicate copy to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

If there is anything else I can help you with, be sure to write.

Sincerely Yours,

H. C. Roth, Project Director
Volunteer Flight Officer Network
