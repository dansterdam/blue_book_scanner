The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document, possibly part of a Project Blue Book report.

The text in the document reads:

The light shone steadily - not flickering.
It seemed to hover at approximately 200 feet above the trees.
At one time it seemed to come directly toward me, then it would move away.
It was triangular in shape and appeared to have lights on the corners.
The lights appeared to alternately brighten and dim.
At times it appeared to be one solid light, then it would break up into three distinct lights.
After about 15 minutes the object moved off to the northwest and disappeared.
The sighting lasted for about 30 minutes.
The object made no sound.
