Re: reference your recent telephone conversation with 2Lt Carson Warren in which you reported the unidentified observations of your daughters on 17 August 1963. The information you provided is not sufficient for evaluation. Please have your daughters complete the enclosed AF Forms 117 and return them in the envelope provided. Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.
