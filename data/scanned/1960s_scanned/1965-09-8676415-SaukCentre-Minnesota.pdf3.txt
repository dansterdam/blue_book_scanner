REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEW/UFO

UPO 8 IGHTIMO, 11 September 1965

TO: Hq USAF SAFOIDG (Mrs. Hunt)

REFERENCE the attached letter from Sgt. Atch, USAF, a resident of Sauk Centre, Minnesota. The following ia suggested reply:

Dear Mrs. Hunt:

1. Your sighting of 11 September 1965 has characteristics of an aircraft observation. However, it is impossible to check the military traffic at that time to determine positively your identification. Your description of the blinking light and disappearance of the object is consistent with an aircraft at high altitude. An aircraft at high altitude often appears to disappear when reflecting surface of the aircraft becomes invisible as it banks away from the observer. The fact that it was not seen to land is explained by the fact that the aircraft was at a very high altitude.

FOR THE COMMANDER:

ERIC T. de JONCKHEERE, Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Technology and Simulations

Please accept our apology regarding the volume of mail received on the same subject. Your understanding of this situation is appreciated.

A Thank you for your interest and assistance in our program. 

Sincerely,

C. L. Hitch  
Lt, Atch, USAF
