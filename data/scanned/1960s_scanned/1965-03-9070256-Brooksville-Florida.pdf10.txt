The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an observed UFO incident.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The hole or shallow depression was about 35 feet in diameter and about 3 to 5 inches deep. The hole walls are steep and almost circular. The ground is powdery dry of a grayish color. The grass, sand, and debris around the hole and area give the impression that it was heavily compressed as if something weighing about 25 to 30 tons had been there. The witness said it was a whistling sound. He said he in his state since it was a familiar sound. The witness said in his tape there were many footprints, but the photos only show a few persons. The holes are to shallow for objects this size to make. Also the leaves with an object, with an object, would surely distribute the grass, sand, and debris around the hole and area."
