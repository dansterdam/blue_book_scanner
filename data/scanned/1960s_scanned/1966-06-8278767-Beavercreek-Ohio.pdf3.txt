Text extracted from the document:

"Please excuse our delay in answering your letter of 9 February 1967 in which you reported your observation to the Air Force. With out essential data such as angular velocity, flight characteristics, duration of the sighting, etc., a comprehensive evaluation cannot be undertaken. If you had reported your June 1966 observation to the nearest Air Force Base, a detailed investigation would have been undertaken. It is extremely difficult to investigate a sighting which is more than a month or so old.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force."
