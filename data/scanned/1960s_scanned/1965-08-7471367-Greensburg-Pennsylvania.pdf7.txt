There is no photograph present in this page from the old UFO report document. The text appears to be a detailed description and analysis of a UFO sighting that occurred on August 13th, 1965 in Greensburg, Pennsylvania.

The sighting of August 13th, 12:17 A.M. Eastern Daylight Time is the best reported, and I will give a description, the other two sightings different from that.

It had been seen on several counts. He rules out a slow meteor on several counts. He is also rules out because he saw the object on the New York-Pittsburgh flight pattern, and was seen by plane spotters.

It is interesting to note that if the objects on success seemed a startling, the reported would have been 1 bright enough to illuminate sufficiently that a life of that 6 a few day passage would have been possible, and that the time giving an average height of 57 miles and an angular speed that observed. There is the outside possibility that it was internal visible which would have had a life of just a few seconds.

The passage would have been considerably to the west, the object must not have reappeared. At about 2:00 A.M.
