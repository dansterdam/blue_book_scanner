1. This refers to your correspondence on your unidentified object sighting of August 26, 1967.  Although we have written to you other times about similar sightings, you indicate that other reports have been received on sightings of garment bag hot air balloons. These balloons are similar to the objects you describe, and are the most probable explanation.  The upper dull glowing object is the garment bag, and the reddish and yellow pulsing lights are the burners which control the lift of the object. Some times the object is mistaken for something more exotic when the garment bag and as it rises, sparks and pieces of burning debris fall from the unsealed bag before they hit the ground.  Sightings of these objects have been reported throughout the country and the colors of these balloons are red, orange, yellow or white.

2. All of the above should be consistent with your sighting.  However, on your form you indicate that the objects traveled from the northeast.  This is the route these balloons are usually launched from the southwest.

3. We would like to know if you are positive that the objects were traveling toward the northeast. Could the objects have been traveling from the southwest?

Any additional information you have on your sighting may be helpful in clarifying this matter.  Thank you for your assistance in this fascinating matter.
