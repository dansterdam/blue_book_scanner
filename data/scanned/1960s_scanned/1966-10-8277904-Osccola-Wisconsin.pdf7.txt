The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, specifically a questionnaire with handwritten responses.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 14 - 8 - 66
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
When, it was first sighted, it was in the sky and stationary, it was stationary about 10 minutes, the sighting just started and ceased as suddenly as it started, then seemed to go in different directions a while on the right side, them seemed to go back to the original orange again as if it moved on.
By the time it was sighted again it seemed to go through them. There was no sound as far as could be recognized, as it was not heard at all, after a time it seemed to go in a different direction and was seen no more.
It had wings of smaller dimension and smaller as was estimated to appear at it front or sides as it moved.
My parents did not see it all, but was awakened in shock, as it was not at this instance all children to be.
Reached home and drew this illustration to be.
