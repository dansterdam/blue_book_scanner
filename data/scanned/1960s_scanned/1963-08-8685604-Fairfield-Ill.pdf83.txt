Story Given Big Play

The "light in the sky" story is 
gaining momentum.

Series of people saw an unusual
object on the eastern sky here
Wednesday night about 9 o'clock.

Bright As Diamond
Perhaps getting the best view
of the phenomenon was Chaffney
Hill, operator of the gasoline
station at the junction of U.S.
highway 45, four miles east of
Fairfield, and he said that "it
was brighter than the
brightest star." Mike Hill, operator of the
Hill gasoline plant here, said 
that he and two other men were
standing in the yard talking and

"I quickly saw it . . . it was
moving from the west, some over
25,000 feet high." 

"SHE SWOOPED AROUND WITH LIGHTNING-LIKE SPEED," said Chaffney Hill, "and changed its
course as she did so." Mike Hill, when they described the object.
