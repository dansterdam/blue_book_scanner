Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

We have the analysis of your conversation piece back as from your letter of [REDACTED] which you submitted and enclosed with original. The object you described as a strange native copper cover really has the appearance of an opened up copper covering such as further explained in your letter. Native copper is closely tied up with the history of certain areas of the State and the presence of native copper could really opened up the territory.

I am sorry that you have a motorist, but this was a good conversation piece.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
