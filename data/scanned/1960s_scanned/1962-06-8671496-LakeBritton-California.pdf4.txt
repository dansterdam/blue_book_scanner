Dear Sirs:

On a recent trip in Modoc County, we were camped near Lake Britton on June 13th, when we saw what happened. We would like to know if this is some "natural" thing that has been recorded before, or if it is something "secret" that the military is involved in.

Shortly before 9:00, we noticed a "shooting star" that streaked across the sky for about a second... then another, and another. This happened quite a few times, and about that time, a few "objects" had come from same place in sky, and vanished at same "level."

A few minutes later another went over...and about that time, ALL had come from same place in sky....and vanished at same "level, at a trip "half way" across. I got the closest apparent to me near the ground, and caused no disturbance in area, coming about every ten minutes for several trips, to miss one interval. The next was in proper time, then, in a slow, continuous motion, hover for about two minutes, and then zip back to ten minute intervals again. These objects had no "light"....Then about ten minutes to twelve, an object came, hovered about thr "stars"...this object was slow, did it seemed to never, or stop in place, then seemed to fade as it moved in distance.

ALL THAT CAME FROM SAME PLACE IN SKY....AND VANISHED AT SAME "LEVEL"
