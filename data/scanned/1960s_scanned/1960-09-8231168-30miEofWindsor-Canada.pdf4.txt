There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a typewritten letter.

Dear Sir:
Your letter dated 9-8-60, concerning an unidentified flying object was drawn to my attention.
This is highly probable that as you observed a bright object hovering stationary for a period your observation was a satellite, which many persons confuse with unidentified flying objects. The object you were - sighted would most likely be a known satellite, its appearance and behavior accurately described by Astronomical information which is available. Meteors become visible when they enter the earth's atmosphere and trail light and flame between their point of entry and disappearance. This can be explained as a natural atmospheric phenomena and seen by many observers.
I must caution you that your visioinal perception may not always be correctly interpreted, especially in dealing with objects at a distance, and whose speed and behavior between minimum and maximum limits is difficult to determine accurately. Weather conditions, lighting factors and the observer's own frame of reference are factors often overlooking in evaluating the nature of such objects. I trust this explanation will assist you in your future observations.
Sincerely,
LAURENCE J. TABON
