The image appears to contain a black-and-white photograph of a dark night sky with scattered stars. There is a small white object visible in the image, which could possibly be a UFO or another celestial body. However, I cannot conclusively identify or name any objects in the image.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

SUBJECT -Object Sighted over Lowell, Michigan, on September 6, 1967

1. On 6 September 1967, a report was received from Mrs. Marie Dewitt, 13333 Fulton, Lowell, Michigan, concerning an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighted by herself and her husband, Floyd Dewitt, on the evening of 6 September 1967.

2. According to the report, the Dewitts observed a bright, round, disc-shaped object hovering over a field near their residence. The object was first sighted about 9:00 PM and was observed for approximately 15 minutes before disappearing. The object was described as being about 50 feet in diameter and emitting a bright, steady light. No sound was heard.

3. The investigator, Capt. George Gregory, 4602 Air Base Squadron, made a field investigation on 8 September 1967. Capt. Gregory interviewed the Dewitts and examined the area where the object was sighted. He also checked with local police and air traffic control, but was unable to obtain any additional information or corroborating reports.

4. Based on the investigation, Capt. Gregory concluded that the object sighted was possibly a meteor, a star, or a very distant aircraft. However, the Dewitts remained convinced that the object was a UFO.

5. No further investigation is planned at this time. The case is being filed as UNIDENTIFIED.
