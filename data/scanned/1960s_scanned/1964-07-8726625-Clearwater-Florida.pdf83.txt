Case of a alleged U.F.O. sighting at Clearwater, Florida on 1825 July 3. Witness: Capt. William F. McDaniel, U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Retired.

Witness's description:
At about 8:05 P.M. on July 8, 1964, while on the beach at Clearwater, Florida, I observed an object in the sky to the west, which seemed to be about 1,500 to 2,000 feet in altitude. It appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and circular in shape. It had a bluish-white glow and was moving at a very rapid speed, much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. It was heading in a northeasterly direction at about a 45-degree angle. As it moved, the glow seemed to intensify and then diminish. After observing it for about 10 minutes, it suddenly disappeared from sight. I called the nearby Clearwater Police Department to report the incident, but they stated they had received no other reports of such an object.
