The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document with text about a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Lansing, Michigan, and 'what's it, but there was a lining, a dome, on top?' This apparently occurred as described, not from the vantage point where the observers were, but could have been something on their side.

The investigators found the two witnesses described running at 90Â° to the directions described later during the interview, and in correspondence to the original description, stated clearly in this interview, that the object was stationary on the east-west course; the object would then have appeared from the south, and disappeared ahead of them, that is, to the north.

All the witnesses were students at Michigan State University, where they had returned from the scene. They were returning to their residences after a speech on campus."
