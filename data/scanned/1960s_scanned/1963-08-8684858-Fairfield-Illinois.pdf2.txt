Dear sirs,
Queen June 23, 1960

Chicago 1963, 020

Dear Sir:
I would like to report a sighting of an unidentified flying object which I observed on the evening of June 23, 1960. While driving from Fairfield, Illinois to my home, I noticed a peculiar light in the sky. At first I thought it was an aircraft, but as I watched it, I realized it was not an ordinary aircraft. The light was moving in a very erratic manner, making sharp turns and changing direction rapidly. It was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. 

Between this peculiar light and another light about 1/2 mile away, there seemed to be some kind of connection or relationship. The two lights would move together, one appearing to follow the other. At times, the lights would join together and then separate again.

I watched this display for about 15 minutes before the lights disappeared from view. It was a clear, moonlit night and the lights were easily visible against the dark sky. I have no explanation for what I saw, and I would very much appreciate any information you could provide about this sighting. Please let me know if you require any additional details from me.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
