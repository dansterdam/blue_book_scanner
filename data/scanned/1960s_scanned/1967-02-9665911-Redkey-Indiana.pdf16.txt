The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing a questionnaire with blank spaces for the witness to fill out. The text on the page reads "34. Date you completed this questionnaire:" and "35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting." The rest of the page is blank, presumably for the witness to provide additional details about their UFO sighting.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 3-7-67
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
