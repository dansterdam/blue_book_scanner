There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from a document with text and instructions, but no photograph.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

An x, y plot of 20.5, 21.5 - 25.5, 13.5 - 25.5, 19.5

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

Seemed to slowly fade away.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Disc-shaped object or objects which, when viewed from a distance, would appear similar in size and shape to the one observed.
