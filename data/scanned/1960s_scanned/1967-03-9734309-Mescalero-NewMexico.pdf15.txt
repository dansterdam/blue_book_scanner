The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document page discussing a hypothesis regarding visual and radar descriptions of an unidentified object. The text does not mention or describe any visual evidence or photographs.

7. One hypothesis which fits the visual and radar description is an extraterrestrial vehicle in the area. No one will admit dropping chaff, although an aircraft from the 47768th observed it following. It was returning from a chaff mission elsewhere. If the objects were chaff, however, someone else at the Summit should have seen them.
8. No other explanation presents itself.
