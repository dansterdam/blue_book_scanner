The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will now proceed to extract and output the text from the document:

I am James Lutz of Ft. Seneca, Ohio and have been interested in the subject of flying saucers for some time. On the evening of October 8, 1960 at approximately 8:15 p.m. I observed an unusual object in the sky. The object was about the size of a quarter held at arm's length and appeared to be silver in color. It was moving in an erratic manner, darting back and forth and up and down. It made no sound that I could hear. I watched the object for about 2 or 3 minutes before it suddenly disappeared. I have no idea what this object was, but I am certain it was not an airplane, meteor, or any other known object. I have seen many things in the sky over the years, but this was unlike anything I have ever seen before. I hope this report will be of some value in the continuing investigation of unidentified flying objects.
