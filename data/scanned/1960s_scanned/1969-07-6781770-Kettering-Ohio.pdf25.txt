The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of two objects in the sky, a larger disc-shaped object and a smaller object. The text below the image provides some description of the objects, indicating that the drawing will show the shape and size of the phenomenon observed, and provide an arrow to indicate the direction the phenomenon was moving.

TEXT OUTPUT:
THIS DRAWING WILL SHOW THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON. IT INCLUDES AN ARROW THAT MIGHT INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE IN MILS OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED? ON THE STREET THIS OBJECT WOULD BE ABOUT AS LARGE AS (WHAT OBJECT) AND (HOW FAR) AWAY, JUDGING BY THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT WAS COVERED BY THIS MEASURED ANGLE, AND APPROXIMATELY WHAT ANGLE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBTENDED BY THE TOTAL OBJECT?
