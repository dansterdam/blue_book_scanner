Recently some newspapers and television sets have learned that an unidentified flying object was observed over the city of Bolar, Virginia and due to these reports, thanks have been played by leading citizens. I can truthfully say and I do not consider it a figuring matter. The small village of Bolar is located in a sparse area and is closely guarded. The residents there are cautious about discussing sightings in our area that would make the headlines when they do occur, and are reluctant to discuss the details of what was observed. I hesitate before reporting this subject as the postal inspector, who after his review, did not consider it a reportable incident to the Project Blue Book authorities. I did however not feel that these questions were the highest aspect of the matter.

Sincerely,
Mrs. Josephine D. Randolph
