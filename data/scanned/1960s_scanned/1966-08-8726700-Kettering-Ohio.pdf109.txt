DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
In this case an atmospheric phenomenon was involved. The observer saw a bright light in the sky which at times appeared to break into smaller lights and then regroup into a single light. This effect was apparently caused by the light passing through varying lenticular atmospheric layers of differing refractive indexes. This caused a refraction and dispersion effect similar to that seen in a prism. The witness was mistakenly interpreting this as a "disintegrating" or "reforming" UFO.
