to the front yard took another 10 seconds; the final phase probably lasted about 10 seconds. The total time of the event, then, would be about one minute; the estimate given by was 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. A reasonable estimate would be one to two minutes.
While the events at the home were occurring, the son and his friend, [REDACTED], were walking along some railroad tracks about one-half of a mile north of the home, their position being in a direct line with the window-to-fence-post line of sight described previously.
They heard a wavering sound "like a police car", and saw the sky to the northeast light up. The light appeared to travel rapidly (in less than five seconds) from bearing 045 to bearing 120. No light-source was seen, just the lit-up sky. The point where the light disappeared was in the direction of the suburban home, but could also have been over the highway. Neither boy thought much of what they had seen. They returned home within ten or fifteen minutes, and only related what they had seen when Mr. [REDACTED] said that they had missed seeing a flying saucer.
[REDACTED] said that he never had believed in those things before; in fact when he heard that his children were learning about UFOs in school, he thought the teacher was wasting their time on nonsense. The only book on UFOs he has in the house is a paperback by Frank Edwards, given to him after his sighting, by a friend. He now definitely believes that there are such things.
At the time of the sighting the weather was threatening. The ceiling was about 650 feet, solidly overcast, and there was a tornado near.
