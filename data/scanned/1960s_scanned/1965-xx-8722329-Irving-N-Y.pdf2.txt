UFO SIGHTINGS

Mr. USAF RESERVE (Ret. Ring)

1. We have received a letter from Mrs. *****, who apparently resides in the vicinity of *****, Texas. According to her account, she and her family sighted a UFO on the evening of November 8, 1965. The duration of the observation should not exceed two to three minutes. 

As described, the object appeared to be high in the sky, and was a bright, steady light. It did not appear to move, or change color, or even disappear. It just seemed to hang there, without any visible means of propulsion. No sound was heard.

During the course of October, this planet VENUS was very bright, low in the southwestern sky, and could have been mistaken for a UFO by some observers. As the description given is rather meager, it is difficult to determine if this was indeed a UFO sighting, or simply a misidentification of a well-known celestial object.

3. ALL REPORTS, regardless of their apparent validity, are recorded in terms of man-made objects or of objects attributed to natural explanations. It is regrettable that the scope of this case precludes a more detailed investigation. However, without an actual sighting, or other tangible evidence, a definitive conclusion as to the identity of the object cannot be made at this time.
