Alliance, Ohio....April, 1964....A large orange glow, was the first thing noticed around 5:30 A.M. on this morning. Directly east, in the distance it seemed to be hovering, and then suddenly disappeared against a large white building about 400 yards away, on his neighbor's property. The observer-claimed redditional sharp object, 1 1/2 times as high as the white building itself, about 100 feet broad, was moving to and fro in a radius of about 50 yards, this object being in the air above the building. Its dimensions being greatest. He could not determine the exact attitude, due to the dimness. After about 10 seconds, it darted away to the east and by the time he had run inside to obtain his binoculars, it was no longer be seen. He couldn't discern anything where the object had been. In the morning, early, he went down into the pasture and saw some peculiar markings on the ground. The grass and ground were flattened. No residual marks could be found, that would indicate any landing or take-off. After careful search, no other evidence could be found. Subscribing to the investigators' opinion, similar but incomplete "design" on the ground. Substantiating witnesses have not been contacted on this recently discovered sighting.

The form of these discolorations: generally hour glass-like.
