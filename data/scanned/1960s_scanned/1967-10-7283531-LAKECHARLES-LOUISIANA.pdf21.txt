The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch and a compass rose diagram. The sketch appears to be an illustration showing the angle and elevation of an unidentified flying object above the horizon. The compass rose diagram appears to be provided for reference.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" at the end of the line that shows how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" at the end of the line where you last saw the object. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
