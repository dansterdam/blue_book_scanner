MEMO FOR THE RECORD

RE: Lt Logman from Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan, called on 25 November 1965. 

He said that a bright light has been observed over Lake Erie for several weeks. He wanted to know if flares have been dropped in the area.

Sgt Moody told him that we could do nothing about Canadian reports.
