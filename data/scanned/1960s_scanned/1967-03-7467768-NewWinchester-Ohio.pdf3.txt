The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image shows a form with various questions about the observed object, including whether it disappeared while being watched, whether it moved behind or in front of something, and a description of the object's sound and color. The witness also provided a sketched description of the object's shape and movement. I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document, excluding any references to or descriptions of the human witness.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Unusual, colored light, buzzer
b. Color: Orange to red

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
BETTER THEN ONE HALF

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

This object had a shape and was no more than 300 yards away and it moved in a straight line very slowly and silently from directly overhead in a southerly direction.
