34. Date you completed this questionnaire:       Day       Month       Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The first object and second were oblong in shape. The first one seemed to be burning at its edge and had a yellowish-orange glow. The second one was about the same size but not as bright. They passed in the southern most part of travel at about a 30 to 40 degree angle. Both object moved at a terrific speed, faster than any jet I have seen. They appeared to be about 4 to 5 miles away and not more than 1000 feet high. The second object was slightly higher than the first. They disappeared very rapidly in the southern horizon. I got a very good look at both objects and they appeared to be solid and not just lights. I do not believe this was any type of aircraft I am familiar with.
