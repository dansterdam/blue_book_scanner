Text output from the document:

NOTE: It should be clearly established that sightings of such objects are quite rare and should be thoroughly investigated.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

90°
75°
60°
45°

0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture to show the way they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

We saw only one object that was really strange (horrible). The only other object we saw was a satellite (moon) which was also unimaginable, but it was not nearly as impressive or concerning as the strange object. We could not identify the object, nor its purpose or origin, but it was clearly visible for around 5 to 10 minutes, and then disappeared instantly, rather than fading away.
