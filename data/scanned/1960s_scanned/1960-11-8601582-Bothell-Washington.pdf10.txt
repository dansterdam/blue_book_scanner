The image appears to be a photograph showing a landscape with some distant buildings or structures. There is text below the photograph describing the image, but no human faces are visible.

In addition, here is the text that I have extracted from the document:

An attempt to recreate, o or frame, what 3 private citizen's claims they saw - A bright white light hovering about 3 feet off the ground for approximately 1 minute, then suddenly vanishing. Photograph taken November 8, 1960 at Bothell, Washington.
