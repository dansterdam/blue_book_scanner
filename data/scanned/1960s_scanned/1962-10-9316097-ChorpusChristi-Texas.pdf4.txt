EVALUATION REPORT
Analysis of Glass-like sample.

I. PURPOSE:
TO chemically analyse a glass-like sample.

II. PARTIAL DATA:
a. The sample was assigned ASRCPA control number 10,360.
b. It was tested for radioactivity using a scintillation counter. No radioactivity above background was detected.
c. The sample was tested for the transmission of light in the visible region. It has good transmission in the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared regions. It has about 10% transmission in the visible region, 0.4 to 0.75 micron wave length.
d. It became brittle on exposure to ultraviolet radiation within the test chamber.
e. Chemical analysis for carbon and hydrogen using microchemical techniques detected no carbon and only 0.16% by weight of hydrogen. This concentration of hydrogen is less than the allowable error of 1.02% consequent to the significance in negligible.
f. Analysis by light emission spectrography provided these data:
