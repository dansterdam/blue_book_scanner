"SANDS 'SAUCER' LANDING PROBED

shaped object on the desert about a mile south of Socorro. He denied seeing any signs of life around the object and said the machine rose and fell slowly - vanishing until it faded from sight. 
He said he spotted what appeared to be a pair of white overalls near the saucer, but could not tell if anything or anyone was in them. The object, about the height of a car, but larger, appeared to be made of a shiny, aluminum-like substance. A moment later, it flew slowly after the gas disappeared within about 100 yards, he said.
TWO INVESTIGATING officers were at the scene yesterday from Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque. Maj. William Connor and Sgt. David Moody used a Geiger counter to check the area. where the only evidence of an unusual visitor was a burned bush and four small depressions in the ground.
Zamora said the machine had been supported by a round, blue leglike object, and the bush supposedly was burned by exhaust from the saucer. He said he first saw the object from about 200 yards away and thought it was an overturned automobile. He said it was smoking.
Zamora said he also saw what looked like white coveralls, but could not tell if anyone - or anything - was in them. 
DRIVING to within 100 feet of the object, the policeman said he saw what looked like red lettering on the side of the object. He said it then rose from the ground and sailed off in a westerly direction, never getting more than 20 feet off the ground and narrowly missing a dynamite shack.
Holder said he checked with both White Sands and nearby Holloman Air Force Base. Neither base, he said, is using any object comparable to Zamora's machine. Government agencies will continue the investigation, Holder said."
