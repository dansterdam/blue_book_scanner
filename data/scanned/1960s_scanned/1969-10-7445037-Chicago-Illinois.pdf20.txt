NOV - 5 1969

Dear Sir:

The enclosed requests for help have been sent to Chicago Today. The Action Line column receives over 4,000 such pleas every week. We have sifted the complaints and are sending along only those which we feel merit your attention.

In behalf of Chicago Today and of these people, we ask you give them consideration if your investigation shows that action is justified.

May we ask that you advise us of any action you take.

Sincerely,

Kenan Heise
EDITOR OF ACTION LINE

P.S. May I ask that you please return the enclosure with your reply. It helps us serve both you and the correspondent better.
