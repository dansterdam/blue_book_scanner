TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "A" on the curved line that the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the point on the compass where you first saw the object. 
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place a "B" at the point, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
