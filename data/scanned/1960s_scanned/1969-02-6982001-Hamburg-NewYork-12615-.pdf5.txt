The image shows a black and white photograph of a Project Blue Book contact patch on a fabric item, likely a hat or uniform. The patch appears to have a circular design with several elements inside it.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969. This image appears to be from a document related to that program.
