The document image you've provided contains a compass rose diagram at the top and two sketched images at the bottom. I'll describe the images and then provide the text content.

Top image:
- There is a compass rose with cardinal and intercardinal directions marked (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and the variations in between like NNE, ENE, etc.).
- Two letters are placed on the compass rose: "A" is positioned between E and ENE, and "B" is directly at E.

Bottom images: 
- The first sketch on the left shows a domed horizon view with clouds in the sky. A dashed line starts from the lower center of the image (indicating the observer's point of view) and goes up and to the right, labeled with an "A" at the start and a "B" near the top where the line ends, suggesting the path of the observed phenomenon.
- The second sketch on the right is similar to the first, showing the domed horizon but with a shorter dashed line connecting an "A" and a "B".

Here is the text as requested:

```
6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. 

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT
APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE
THE LARGER SKETCH.
