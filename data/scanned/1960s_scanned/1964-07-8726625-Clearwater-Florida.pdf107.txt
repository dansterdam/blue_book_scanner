There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

"There the reliability of Clearwaters report is been amply confirmed, since an examination of the available official records shows that an unusual unexplainable aerial object was reported and actually observed by the witnesses.

The present location of the object and time and nature of its appearance are so well established that they can with certainty be placed on the map and on the astronomers and navigators star charts.

The location of the object coincides closely with a point marked on the nautical charts as the place of an unusual incident reported by an airline pilot in May 1964.

The formulation of the light was the most accurate and important aspect of the record, since accuracy in knowing the exact nature and behavior of the light is essential for establishing its identity. In this respect the witness' testimony can accurately be depended upon. 

It is highly significant that the testimony of the witnesses shows the object failed to maneuver in any way that could be associated with aircraft, missiles, or similar devices. It is evident that only one conclusion can be drawn from the facts that the object was all things of the kinds the witnesses could readily identify, and yet it exhibited properties that are mutually exclusive of each other. (The witnesses specifically stated the object was not moving in any way associated with aircraft or missiles.)"
