1. Received several reports in the area of several reports of unidentified flying objects over the Memphis area, particularly on 9 May 1967.

2. Request information on activity of any aircraft engaged in aerial advertising in the Memphis, Tennessee area. Reports consist of blinking lights descending, ascending, circled, and hovered over Memphis. If not determined, would indicate if such an aircraft was airborne over Memphis on the night of 9 May 1967. If the control's name and address are known by your office, this information could be most helpful in our evaluation.
