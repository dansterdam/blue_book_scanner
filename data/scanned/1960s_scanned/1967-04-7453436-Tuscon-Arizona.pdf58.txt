35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting:
I watched cant of my yard towards the East and noticed at about 8:30 PM (DST) a bright light in the sky travelling in a easterly direction at a high rate of speed. The object appeared to be stationary for a few seconds and then started travelling again in a straight line. The object left no trail and appeared to be oval in shape. The color was very bright and close to white. The object was visible for about 15-20 seconds before it disappeared from sight. I tried to locate the object by looking in that general direction but could not see it again. I live on a farm and have not seen an object like this before. The night was clear and there was a 3/4 moon.
