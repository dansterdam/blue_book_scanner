The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with text but no visible image.

I will now act as an OCR system and transcribe all the text found in the document:

March 4, 1968

I compare this with meteorites, missile re-entries and satellites I have seen and am certain this is none of these. I hope this information is helpful. I have no other information to add and heard perhaps half a dozen air carrier pilots make similar reports.

Drop me a line when you compare this and next time I am in Denver, I would enjoy a chat with you.

Yours very truly,
