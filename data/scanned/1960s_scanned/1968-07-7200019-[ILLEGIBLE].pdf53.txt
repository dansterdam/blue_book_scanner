WEATHER MAPS
SERIES JULY 8-14, 1968

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analyses of the principal weather features. The curved isobars show the height contours of the pressure levels, the wind direction and speed, and the weather symbols at each station.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the contours of the pressure at the 500-millibar level, about 18,000 feet above sea level. The isotherms are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius.
