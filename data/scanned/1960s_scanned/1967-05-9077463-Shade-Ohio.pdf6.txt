Dear Sirs,

On 5 April 1967 at approx. 8 - 8:30 P.M. central standard time, I observed a very bright object in the sky in the east southeast direction. At first I thought it might be a star, but it was moving rapidly and changing colors from blue-green to red to yellow and back again. It appeared to be at a very high altitude and I watched it for approximately 3-4 minutes before it disappeared from view. I have never seen anything like this before and I am quite sure that what I observed was not an airplane, satellite, or any other known type of aircraft. If you have any additional information on this sighting, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Sincerely,
