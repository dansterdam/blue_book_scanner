The image contains a pencil drawing of a triangular-shaped object with an arrow pointing to it. The text indicates that the observer was asked to draw a picture that would show the shape of the object or objects, and to label and include any details of the object such as wings, protrusions, and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It seemed to be a high vertical climb and disappeared out of sight.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one:)     Yes         No      Don't know.  If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: 
A small cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one:)     Yes         No      Don't know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - silent
b. Color - varied from reddish white to bluish-white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
All of it

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
