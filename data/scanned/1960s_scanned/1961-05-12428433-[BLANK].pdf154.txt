PROJECT MERCURY
The cost of successfully completing Project Mercury could exceed one-half billion dollars, dependent upon the success of meeting the flight test and development goals as presently envisioned. Again, consideration must be given to the fact that Project Mercury is, in fact, two programs - a bold development program just to establish the basic capsule costs.
Some critics of Project Mercury believe that it is being overtaken by advancing technology; however, it appears that the state of the art provides the resources that such is the case. The Air Force plan calls for MIDAS and SAMOS as a parallel program as we progress in our approach to manned-space flight. The Discovery program is providing valuable data for future space endeavors. DOD and NASA participation in numerous missile and space program developments that would result in certain hardware developments and configuration of the capsule and the booster that would directly benefit the Mercury concept which is to achieve an early capability for orbiting.
Project Mercury is now 24 years old. Since its inception, an extensive development and flight test program has been carried out to meet major rocket launchings; the Mercury production capsules were designed and tested, and a major network of communications and tracking stations was completed and continuing readiness of both the systems and the institutions involved in their utilization for the Mercury Project have led to manning and unmanned-ballistic flights, leading to manned orbital flight.
Project Mercury continues to move forward in an atmosphere of confidence. Morale is high, hours are long, and the achievements of successful manned-orbital flight.
