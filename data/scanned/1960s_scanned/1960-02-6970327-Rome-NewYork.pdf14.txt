SIMILAR SIGHTINGS ELSEWHERE:

It is interesting to note that the explosion and flash which covered a wide area (Hollywood), occurred within this area, in the first instance, that a bright flash, accompanied by explosion. The time of the object's observation over New York was 12:03 A.M., EST, February 6. (See article page 11.)

Also of interest was the "fiery red flying object" which was seen over Oakland, California, December 2, 1959. (See article, page 11.) The object was sighted at approximately 5,000 feet altitude, and it shot up at "fantastic speed".

Sightings over Alaska, February 16, 1960, mention "flash" and explosion.

The significance of those sightings, in relation to the Hollywood sighting of February 5 and 6, is speculative, but too important to be overlooked in an overall evaluation of the problem.

"Sky-Riding Objects Confirmed" 

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Feb. 16 (AP) - The North American Air Defense Command confirmed today that unidentified flying objects were observed over Alaska early yesterday.

The spokesman said the objects were reported by several observers near Nome. It appears they may have been Russion satellites reentering the atmosphere. The objects disappeared without a trace, the spokesman said.

Note object "silvery" and "tubular" seen over Alaska Feb. 16.

"Tubular" object reported over Hollywood Feb. 6 by Mr. Harold Sherman and Mrs. June Di Maggio.
