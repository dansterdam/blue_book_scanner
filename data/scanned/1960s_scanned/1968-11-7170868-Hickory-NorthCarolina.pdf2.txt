The size is about the same as the sun. It would not stay still, but rather would dart back and forth and up and down. It was either bluish-white or reddish-orange in color. It seemed to be giving off its own light rather than reflecting light. After about 5 minutes, it went out of sight. I could not determine how far away it was.
