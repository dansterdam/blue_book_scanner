1. Following is a summary of UFO activity in the Hawaiian Islands (HIFP) during the period 2 August to 5 August 1965:

a. On 3 August 1965, 0800Z (2/2000 local) a family living in Waikiki Beach reported bright lights moving across the sky at high altitudes and on various headings. The lights appeared to change colors from red to blue. During the telephonic conversation with the family, I was able to obtain the following additional information:

(1) The lights were very bright and illuminated the Waikiki area.
(2) I saw nothing except some bright stars. Since no one else reported the lights, they reportedly were flying over a heavily populated area, I consider the report to be unidentified.

b. On 4 August, 0644Z (3/2044 local) numerous sightings were made 55 miles southwest of Oahu. The sightings differed on the colors but all described it as bright lights which fell from the sky to the ocean. One object was said to have descended at a rapid 180 degrees per second. Honolulu VORTAC said it was bright enough to illuminate the clouds as it fell to earth. Both pilots and naval observers believed that it burned out before hitting the water. The pilots said it finally broke into three pieces before it burned out. It could not have been an aircraft from U.S. space operations, and it is unlikely that it was Reentry from U.S. satellites. Analytically, there is a possibility that it was an unidentified natural phenomenon.
