This page of the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) incident that occurred in Bloomingburg, New York.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Enclosed please find the recording tape involving an unidentified flying object incident at Bloomingburg, N.Y. I feel that it is reasonably accurate, and I sincerely hope that it will be of some value for what it is worth.

Several months ago, the person, item A, stated that she sighted the incident to the Middletown Record. Shortly afterwards, while the paper (Middletown Record) quotes her as stating that the older girl, item B, was the first to relate the incident.

The letter states that they believed that the object was a "Flying Saucer". It was stated that they were positive it was not any hoax. The author states that since the Air Force classifies UFOs as "Unknowns", they didn't want to delude them.

The author concludes by requesting that the Air Force contact them regarding any stated or relative issue on the tape, which they found puzzling.
