OPERATOR'S REPORT RECORD

SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

1. On 30 April 1960, a report of an unidentified flying object sighted in the area of La Camp, Louisiana (02450) LOC) on 25 April 1960. This report was forwarded to ATIC by the Intelligence Division, USAF, England.

2. The object was reported to have been seen by two witnesses. The witnesses stated that the object was a round disc or sphere, apparently about 25-30 feet in diameter, and was observed for approximately three seconds.

3. The investigation of the details of this report revealed evidence that some object had hit the ground at some point within the area, but there was no other confirmation that what the witnesses saw was actually the object that hit the ground. The search of the area, on foot and by helicopter, failed to reveal the object.

4. Investigation of the points of impact revealed evidence that a foreign material had struck the ground, but the investigation further revealed that this was most likely a meteorite impact rather than any man-made or unidentified aerial object.

5. On 21 April 1960, Major Tripp of the Aerial Phenomena Group, ARDC, conducted an interview of the witnesses. This interview was made with the full cooperation of the local Air Force Base, which assisted in the investigation.
