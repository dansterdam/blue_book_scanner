Dear Major:
The enclosed clipping will show you how I handled the information on the Florida sighting.
Some of the reports seem to get rather garbled as they come down the pipe, but you have given me the general outline to keep on top of.
I'm sure you will be interested to know that when those reports are back, I'll be glad to know more about them so I can pass on what information seems worth passing along. As you mention, if they can't figure out what it is, I'd certainly like to try and make an interesting story from it before your final evaluation is released.
I appreciate the assistance, and wish you luck in ferreting out the final answer.
Cordially,
Alan Watts
