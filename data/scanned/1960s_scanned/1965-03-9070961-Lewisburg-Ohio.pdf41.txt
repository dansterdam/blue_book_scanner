The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document with astronomical data and information about a reported sighting of an unidentified object. The document provides details about the position and stellar magnitude of various celestial objects observed on March 30, 1965 from Lewisburg, Ohio. It also describes a reported sighting on April 2, 1965 of a possible sunlight reflection from an unidentified object near 2200 hours, which would have required an altitude of 200 miles to be visible from the observer's location.

On 2 April 1965 called Dr J Allen Hynek regarding possible sunlight reflection from an unidentified object at 2200. The object was near 2200. At 2023 an object would have to be at an attitude of 200 miles to be in the sunlight. This eliminates the possibility of sunlight reflection on any object in the earth's atmosphere as the cause of the observation.
