Gentlemen:

On 23 October 1966 at approximately 5:00 A.M. Central Standard Time, at Fort Rucker, Alabama, 360 west and 310 north, I observed an earth satellite. It was moving from northwest to southeast and was brighter than the brightest star.

Can you please tell me which of the many satellites it might have been?

Sincerely yours,

Colonel, Infantry
