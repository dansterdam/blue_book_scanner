E. SPECIFY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS OR STREETLIGHTS.
DESCRIBE YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE OBJECT, USING FAMILIAR OBJECTS TO COMPARE IT WITH. FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT APPEARED ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DIME HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH, SO STATE.
IT SEEMED ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL AS SEEN AT A DISTANCE. OR 5 TIMES THE SIZE OF A STAR.
F. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTIVE STATEMENT OF THIS PHENOMENON, NOTE ANY FLASHING LIGHTS OR UNUSUAL COLORS YOU NOTICED. DESCRIBE YOUR IMPRESSION OF WHETHER IT WAS SELF-LUMINOUS AND WHAT COLORS YOU NOTICED. DESCRIBE YOUR IMPRESSION OF WHETHER IT APPEARED TO BE METALLIC, LIKE STARS, DULL, ETC.
THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE BRIGHT BUT NOT EXTREMELY BRIGHT. IT WAS A SINGLE SOLID SOURCE OF LIGHT, LOOKING THROUGH IT I COULD SEE IT WAS NOT JUST ILLUMINATED ALL THE WAY ACROSS, BUT SEEMED TO BE SOLID LOOKING THROUGH IT LIKE LOOKING THROUGH A GLASS OBJECT. THE EDGES WERE SHARPLY DEFINED AND THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE IN VIEW.
