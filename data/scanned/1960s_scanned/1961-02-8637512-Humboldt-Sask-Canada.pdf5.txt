INVESTIGATOR'S REMARKS
According to the information, the investigator has evaluated the content of the report and found multiple witnesses unable to contact. One witness reported seeing a bright object at about 7:30 p.m. through a Weyburn garages. The object moved in an intense manner and according to the witness, appeared to be metallic in nature. Another witness also reported seeing the same object moving at a low altitude. The investigator concludes the report based on the evaluation given by USAF Satellite Tracking Program which suggests the object was an atmospheric entry.
