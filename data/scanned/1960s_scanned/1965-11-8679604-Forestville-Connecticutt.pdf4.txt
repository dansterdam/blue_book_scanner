HEADQUARTERS
FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION
AIR FORCE SYSTEMS COMMAND
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO
REPLY TO: FDJSD/530
DEC 2 1965
SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: Hq USAF SAFOIN (Mrs Hunt)

This written to Defense Secretary McNamara for information as to the sources or sources who have been dropping flares in her area. It is suggested that she contact Bradley Field as Windsor Locks, Connecticut, the next time she sees the flares to be able to tell her which organization is dropping the flares. The recent power failure in the Northeastern was not caused by flying saucers nor was it associated with known sabotage.

FOR THE COMMANDER

Deputy for Technology and Subsystems
