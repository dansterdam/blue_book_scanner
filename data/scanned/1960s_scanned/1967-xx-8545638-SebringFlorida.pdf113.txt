Witness was driving approximately east when she noticed a bright flash to her right. She saw a large red-orange glowing mass approaching at high speed. It appeared to be just a few blocks ahead of her and at tree-top level. She was driving in a residential section. Upon arriving home, she phoned for a sighting report into the police department. The police department contacted the witness for basic details.

* - Assume that UFO was a fireball although no trail was seen or falling sparks. It would have to be extremely bright to be seen in broad daylight. The apparent size, altitude and distance are understandable. Without a reference point, such data are not attainable.
