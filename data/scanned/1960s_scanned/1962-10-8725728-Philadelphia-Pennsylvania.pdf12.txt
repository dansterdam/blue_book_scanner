The image appears to contain two sketches rather than photographs. The first sketch shows an object in the sky above the horizon, and the instructions ask the viewer to place an "A" on the curve of the object and a "B" on the horizon line. The second sketch shows a larger landscape view, with instructions to place an "A" at the position where the object was first seen.

Text from the document:

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this.
