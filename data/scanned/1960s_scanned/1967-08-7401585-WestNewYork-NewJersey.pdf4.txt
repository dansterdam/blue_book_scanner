The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a page from an old report document that lists photographic data, including information about the type and make of camera, focal length and make of lens, brand and type of film, shutter speed used, lens opening used, filters used, and whether a tripod or solid stand was used. The text also mentions that "exact direction camera was pointing with relation to true angle with respect to the ground" and that "if supplemental information is unobtainable, the minimum required are the type of camera and the shutter speed readings of the camera."
