The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page discusses technical aspects of radio interference and its potential effects on UFO sightings. However, there is no image or photograph visible in the provided image.

Text extracted from the document:

of the literature on this subject has, however, failed to substantiate this statement, which is not referenced by Astapovich.(10)  Astapovich has suggested that certain features exhibited kilowatts of power can be omitted by the fireball sources of radio interference. A reception field of 10 to 100 microvolts per meter bandwidth, which would be needed only on the receivers with a 10-kc or more bandwidth. This could account for the relatively few reported instances of radio interference. Wide variations in radio-interference reception could also be explained if the intensity of the effect was a function of the relative direction of the trajectory and loose magnetic-field lines, i.e., if the emission had the sue to lensing-antenna-like effects.
