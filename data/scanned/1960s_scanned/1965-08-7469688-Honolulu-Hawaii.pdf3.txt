TAC C-130 crew observed a high altitude, high speed UFO pass directly overhead on 4 August at 12302 (approximately). At ocean station on November, the same object was sighted and reported to lit up the whole sky as it passed overhead. Investigation revealed it was probably an Atlas satellite drifting from launching. The bright light sighted on 5 August at 0500Z was reported, but ruled non-significant and no investigation was made. This information is forwarded as background information for the Commander.
