The text in the document is as follows:

5 October 1960

Dear Mr. _____,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 11 September 1960 concerning the unidentified flying object you viewed on 16 August 1960.

The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center's analysis of these objects reveals that they were probably velocities comparable to that of satellites and appeared as two end magnitude lights. These observations indicate typical high-flying aircraft.

It is possible to see the lights of high flying aircraft and not be able to resolve the outlines, even with binoculars, on a dark night. The lights seen by you would be the relatively bright running lights on the bottom of the aircraft.

Due to the great amount of traffic through the area, it is impossible to determine the specific aircraft which were probably responsible.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
