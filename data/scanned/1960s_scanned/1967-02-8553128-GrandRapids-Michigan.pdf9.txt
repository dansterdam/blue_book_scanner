There does not appear to be any photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

It occurred at a small airport and the duration was only half minute. There were other potential witnesses. Since it occurred at night it is possible that there were other witnesses available. The case contains potential evidence, but it is possible that there were no other witnesses.

15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California
It was a witness, duration of sighting only 15 seconds.

16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire
Nothing of interest. Sighting lasted a few seconds. No additional information.  

17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.
Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit.

18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.
Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case, the other agency's report, the signing is obviously unidentified.

19. 12 February 1957, Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
I have only the card on this case, but judging from it, there seems to be a possibility that this concerns a sighting of low-flying birds reflecting light. The sighting lasted 4 to 6 seconds and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.

20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Loco, Texas.
I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it classified.
