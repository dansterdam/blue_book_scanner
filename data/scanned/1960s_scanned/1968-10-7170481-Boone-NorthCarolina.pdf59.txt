At first observation, it looked like an inverted bell with a definite outline or a similar form as best. The Paproski material formed a spherical formation for my wife and is registered silver-white in color. It was about the size of a basketball but round-shaped, not football-shaped. I estimated the overall length (or diameter) at 60-70 feet, or about three-quarters of the height of the trees which were a little over 100 feet high.

The object held a steady hovering position, not quite stationary and had a very slight vertical oscillation as if it were balancing. I was amazed to observe such a large machine quietly holding in this position. The most important thing to me at the moment seemed to be the silence - no sound or motion was apparent. Quite suddenly everything seemed to go blank again. I then got out and took a look around, but the object had disappeared. It was about 6:30 when I entered my house.

The sun sets early behind the trees in this area, and this had already occurred. Daylight continued good enough for me to notice the experience to my wife and for her to observe the details I mentioned. I didn't intend to have an undisclosed view of all landscaped flights. Daylight continued long enough for us to relate the experience to my wife and for her to observe the details I mentioned.
