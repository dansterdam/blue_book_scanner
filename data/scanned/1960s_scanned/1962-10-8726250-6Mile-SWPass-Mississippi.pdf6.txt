GLOWING LIGHTS INVADE HOME
On Pampas Drive, which connects with Spring Park Road, an unidentified woman (by request) said a formless "glow" moved through her house, and about a half a block long, and brilliant illuminated car and objects in the yard, that as the glow moved through the house, it moved...and this glow hand light children screamed, through fear. 
Mrs. Gladys Pawette of Cascade Road, the street from which Mrs. Bakers' fire-hall screamed to come, said she saw a glow about 2 feet long between her home and the adjacent house. She said the form was too vague to identify, but called it a "terribly big brilliance." She said the circuit which carries electricity to her bathroom and bedroom was burned out about this time, and was still out the next morning.
