There is no photograph present in this page from the old UFO report document. The page appears to be a form or questionnaire with questions and blank spaces for the witness to fill out.

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound 72" around could be heard
b. Color shiny white at first, then turning to a dull reddish-orange

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show the direction the object was moving.

The witness has provided a written description of the object, describing the sound and color changes, but there is no actual drawing or illustration included on this page.

18. The edges of the object were:
a. Circle (No) b. Fuzzy or blurred c. Like a bright star d. Sharply outlined

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
The witness did not indicate there were multiple objects, so this question was left blank.
