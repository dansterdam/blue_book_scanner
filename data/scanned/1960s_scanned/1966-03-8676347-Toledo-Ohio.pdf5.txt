11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer was asked by other friends to come out of her house to observe a strange object in the sky. When she went out she saw a reddish orange object with luminous bands coming out of the object. The object appeared to be at a stand still. Then it seemed to move slowly. When it moved the object seemed to disappear. Then a reddish glow seemed to reappear. Observer went in the house and got a pair of binoculars. The glow came back out and an aircraft was sighted, giving the observer the impression that the object may have been a bright white light as if a flood light was used.
