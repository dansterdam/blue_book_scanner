RECEIVED 55 WOODMERE 
31 JAN 1965

JACQUES VALLEE, PH. D.,
MANAGER, SYSTEM DESIGN DEPT.,
BOULDER, COLORADO.

DEAR DR. JACQUES VALLEE,

I WAS INTRIGUED BY YOUR RECENT TV APPEARANCE ON THE JOHNNY CARSON SHOW. AS A PROFESSOR OF ASTRONOMY, I AM INTERESTED IN INVESTIGATIONS OF UNKNOWN PHENOMENA, AND I FEEL THAT YOUR WORK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN THIS FIELD.

I ENCLOSE A COPY OF A LETTER I RECENTLY RECEIVED FROM A CORRESPONDENT IN VERMONT, CONCERNING A SIGHTING WHICH HE MADE ON DECEMBER 22, 1964. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN YOUR COMMENTS AND REACTIONS TO THIS REPORT. IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO PURSUE THIS MATTER, I WOULD BE GRATEFUL TO HEAR THEM.

AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFICULTY IN GETTING THE PUBLIC TO TAKE THESE MATTERS SERIOUSLY. I FEEL THAT YOUR OWN WORK HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM, AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO COOPERATE IN INVESTIGATING THESE PHENOMENA.

YOURS SINCERELY,
HECTOR QUINTANILLA
