Proposed reply to ___ (Sighting February 1967)

Dear Mr. ___,

Reference your recent correspondence requesting the Air Force evaluation on your February 1967 observation. I regret the delay in answering your initial correspondence; however, our present heavy workload has precluded an earlier reply. 

Investigation revealed that you probably observed the star Capella; however, without an exact date, we are unable to positively identify what you observed. The description you submitted is consistent with that of an astronomical object. The report is insufficient for numerous unidentified flying object (UFO) observations. Your case is being carried as insufficient data, since without a positive date, a definitive conclusion is not possible.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force; your interest is appreciated.
