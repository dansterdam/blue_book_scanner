HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE A DOT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A SPOT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH IMAGINE YOU HAVE TURNED TO OBSERVE THE PHENOMENON.

THE SMALLER SKETCHES SHOW TYPICAL LANDSCAPE BACKGROUND WHICH OFTEN ACCOMPANY THE PHENOMENON. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "Y" DOTTED LINES AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE TO INDICATE THE ACTUAL MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. SOMETIMES THE PHENOMENON DRIFTS OR IS ACCOMPANIED BY SOME DETAIL WHICH MOVES SEPARATELY FROM THE MAIN OBJECT. A SKETCH MAY BE ADDED ON THE LARGER SKETCH.
