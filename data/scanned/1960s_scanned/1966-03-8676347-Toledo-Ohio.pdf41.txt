Dear Sir:

On March 28, 1966, I reported in a postal card, to you, a UFO incident which I observed.

In reply to this card you sent me an FTD Form 164 to fill out and return. I did so and mailed this form to you on April 6, 1966. I have since received no reply from you and was wondering if maybe you didn't receive or misplaced this report form. If so I would appreciate you sending me another report form which I mailed to you and have not yet had a chance to reply to me as I am interested in your findings and evaluation of the report.

Sincerely,
