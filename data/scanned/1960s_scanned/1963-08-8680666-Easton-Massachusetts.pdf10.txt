REQUEST for UFO Information

To: SAFOI-PB (Mrs Gaise--)
Wash 25 D C

1. The following information is provided to assist you in answering a letter from which our records indicate no previous correspondence.

2. There is no point in discussing the belief that UFO's are real. Extraterrestrial intelligence and advanced technology cannot be proven by the act of Faith, without scientific support. There is also no point in sending him an information sheet, unless he provides us with the evidence to warrant his position.

3. Regarding the sighting at Easton, Massachusetts, August 1963, it is apparently a meteor observation, however, the duration was not recorded and the object was not investigated further. If the witness desires further information, it is suggested that he fill out the form 164 and forward the completed evaluation.

4. The information provided on the South Weymouth, Massachusetts sighting is inconclusive and requires a tentative analysis.
