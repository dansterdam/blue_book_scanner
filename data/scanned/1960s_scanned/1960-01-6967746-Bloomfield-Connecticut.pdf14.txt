The image does not contain a photograph, only a handwritten form with questions and space for responses. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

16. The edges of the object were:
a. Sharply defined
b. Like a bright star 
c. Sharpely outlined
d. Don't remember

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
