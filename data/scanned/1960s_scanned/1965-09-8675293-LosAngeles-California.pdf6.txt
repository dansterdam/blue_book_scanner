The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The first one shows a curved line and an arrow pointing to a compass rose, with text instructions to indicate the direction the object was first seen. The second sketch is a blank space where the observer is instructed to draw a picture showing the motion of the object and any changes in direction during its course.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where the object was when you last saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
