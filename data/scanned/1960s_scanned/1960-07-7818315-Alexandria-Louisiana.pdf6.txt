Output of text from the document:

The sky was very clear and bright. I could see stars in the sky and it was a beautiful night. I noticed a bright light that appeared to be a star but it started moving rapidly. It changed directions sharply several times and was traveling at a high rate of speed. I watched it for about 15 minutes as it darted across the sky. It did not make any sound and seemed to be under intelligent control. I have never seen anything like it before and I am convinced that it was some type of unidentified flying object. I called the sheriff's office to report the sighting but they did not seem very interested. I hope the authorities will take these sightings more seriously in the future.
