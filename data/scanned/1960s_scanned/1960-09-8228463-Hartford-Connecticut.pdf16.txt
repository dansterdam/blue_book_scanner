Dear Major Friend:

It was a pleasure to be with you last Wednesday. I was glad to have the opportunity to give you some information on the internal fall-to-ground phenomenon as an engaging factor in UFO behavior. 

Professor Robert Brown telephoned me upon my return to Washington and mentioned that your office had requested additional samples of our materials and that no samples had yet been received. I assured him of our willingness to comply with your request, and that our efforts would be closely coordinated with the Air Force.

Sincerely yours,

T. Townsend Brown
President
