Dayton Ohio

Dear Mrs. ____,
After reading of your reported UFO observation Tuesday night, March 30th, I am convinced that I also seen this object at approximately 10:00 PM. A passing glance from the corner of my eye to an extremely bright light. This was somewhat low in the sky, south of Dayton near Moraine City. First thought also was of an aircraft, with landing lights, but it did not move. After a short time I got binoculars and could see positively that it did not move and also was much more brilliant than any star. The light was somewhat oval shaped and distorted. Yet despite the perfect atmospheric conditions and I could not gain any idea of the distance. As I was watching the light went out just as if it was turned off by a switch. I watched briefly, and could not detect any beacon light similar to aircraft which I mentioned, passively, at the time to my wife that I thought I had seen a UFO, but gave it no more thought until I read the newspaper story of your experience. You may forward this letter to any investigative authority if you care to, and I will absolutely verify the information as I have described it. If you gain any information as to the explanation of this experience I would appreciate hearing of it.

Sincerely,
_____
