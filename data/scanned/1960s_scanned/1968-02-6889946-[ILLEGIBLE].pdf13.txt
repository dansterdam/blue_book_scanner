USAF 
VEHICLE CASE REPORT 
LOCATION: ALLIS 
DATE: 1/15/
I am writing this report because it seems that the object that was reported sighted does not appear to be the kind of thing that we have come to expect as a normal aircraft. I have a friend who has also seen the same object and he describes it as being much different from any aircraft he has ever seen before. The object appeared to be of a round or disk like shape and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. It seemed to be able to change directions very rapidly and to hover in mid-air as well. The object did not have any wings, tail, or other aircraft type appendages that we would normally expect to see on an airplane or helicopter. The object was sighted on several occasions over a period of two days and the descriptions given by the various observers seem to be consistent. I would be interested in knowing if your organization has had any other reports of similar sightings in this area and whether you have any explanation for what the object could have been.
