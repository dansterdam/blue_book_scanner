Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Thank you for your card of November 18. I hope this letter finds you still interested in the matter you discussed with me. At your request, I have thoroughly reviewed our files and find that in the report you referred to, there was no photograph or other exhibit on the subject incident. It is sometime difficult for us to arrive at a solution to the enigma of UFO's without the assistance of photographic or other physical evidence. If you have any chance to take a photograph or other exhibit on your next observation, it would be most helpful.

Thanks again for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
