Remarks: For the Easter week-end when some elderly neighbor's sitting on their front porch called my attention to the strange lights in the sky. He noticed three lights only then, but subsequently four visual sightings occurred when he took his binoculars. He estimated them to be about the size of the Red River Bridge from Barksdale AFB, and they appeared to be hovering, as though it was a stationary object. When a fourth light appeared suddenly, he decided to get his own binoculars and started following the object. The lights disappeared into the overcast. I drove to the area to see if I could see anything remotely resembling the object described, but could not observe anything. The lights are reported to have hovered for quite a while, but on my arrival the sky was overcast and the lights were gone. SEE AF 232 FOR PREPARATION OF REPORT.
