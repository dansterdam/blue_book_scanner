Dear Miss Shea:

On 8 July 1965, at about 7:11 p.m., this office received a report from you concerning an unidentified flying object (UFO) observed in the Colorado Springs area.

According to your report, you observed a bright circular object, approximately 35-40 feet in diameter, which you described as silvery-white in color. The object was observed hovering and moving about silently for approximately 15-20 minutes before disappearing from view.

This report has been carefully evaluated and analyzed. However, based on the information provided, no definite conclusion can be reached as to the nature or identity of the object observed. It does not appear to match any known conventional aircraft or other identifiable aerial phenomena.

The case has been filed and will be kept on record for any future reference. Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. Should you have any additional information or observations, please do not hesitate to contact this office.

Sincerely,

J.A. HYNEK, Lt. Col., USAF
Commanding Officer
