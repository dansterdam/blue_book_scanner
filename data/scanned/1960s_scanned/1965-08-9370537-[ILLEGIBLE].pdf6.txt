15 APRIL 1966

Dear Mr. __________:

Regarding A. Fontaine's latest "Soucoupes Volantes" bulletin (issue No. 143), which I received for Major Hector Quintanilla, Director of Project Blue Book with the Aeronautical Center in Dayton, Ohio.

Please excuse me for approaching you directly instead of passing through certain hierarchical channels and for taking the liberty of writing to you; but it is necessary that everything be placed in its proper condition in order to arrive at a result with respect to the inquiry undertaken by this government.

I clarify the mysterious appearances throughout the world of these "mysterious" objects which, since the 1950s, are seen with increasing frequency in various parts of the world.

What I have to say follows as a sample to the strictest truth and I assume upon myself the entire responsibility for it and do not hesitate to affirm that what may follow is the product of careful and meticulous research.

This is a very serious matter and certain was experienced more than dramatic.

To think of an impenetrable day, when I had the chance to analyze in detail a certain "object" which I happened to meet on the way, and on this day of the 8th of August 1955 at 1:35 hours, to contemplate these objects and to fix them in 3 photos at 1.9th of a second, is more than the unit can "digest".

And thus to prove to the entire world the undeniable existence of these M.O.C. (Machines Originelles Celestes) (Original Celestial Machines) O.V.N.I. (Objetos Voladores No Identificados) and O.V.N.J. (Objetos Voladores No Jentificados), which are the French and Spanish equivalents of U.F.O.s. It is very difficult to have solid proofs, without being considered "crazy" persons believe in sights or convincing proofs, without being considered "crazy" persons.
