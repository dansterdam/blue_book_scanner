Dear Sir,

I dont know of any reason why we would not be able to look further into it. By my count, the us. nite- lies are not the first one to have worked well over 4000 and observed a bright white of the sky over the northeast as a strange anomaly.I have obtained a brief write up by the Univer-sity of NE & the explanation I got is not complete.May I resubmit the details of this anomaly.
