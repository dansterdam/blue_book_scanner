The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document, possibly related to Project Blue Book, with a series of questions and blank spaces for the witness to fill out their observations.

Here is the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It went bare and forth and expanded and contracted.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: buzzing
b. Color: red
18. Were you able to estimate the size of the object? If so, compare it to the size of the full moon, a car, etc. About 1/2 the size of the full moon was covered.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
