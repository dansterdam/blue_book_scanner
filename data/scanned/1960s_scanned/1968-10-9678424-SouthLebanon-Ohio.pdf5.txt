The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text in the document appears to be a report or witness account related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"It seemed to me that the object was to the east of me, going to the south at a rapid rate of speed. I forgot the illumination it gave out. I could not discern any windows or doors or protrusions of any kind. The movement was too rapid for me to get the exact shape. I have to admit that the object was traveling at an unbelievable speed, much faster than any known man-made aircraft. If this sighting is not a hoax, then I must conclude that the object was an unidentified flying machine."
