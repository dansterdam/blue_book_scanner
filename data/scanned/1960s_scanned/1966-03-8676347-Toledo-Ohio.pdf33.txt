A was in my back yard at the time of the sighting. It was the first time I had gone out to look and see if I could see anything since the sash of sightings in southern Michigan. I had with me a Polaroid camera. I was nervous when I quickly snapped the camera picture as I don't think I got it in the picture. If I had it might not even show as some it was night time, and also because it takes such a small and indistinct picture. I am however submitting the picture for your viewing. These object are were moving in a different direction than usual that night.
May I point out that the line white lines are scratches on the picture made by me while examining it.
