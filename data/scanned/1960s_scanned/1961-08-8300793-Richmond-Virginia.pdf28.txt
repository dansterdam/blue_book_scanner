Transcribing the text from the document:

An object which appeared to be a large aircraft similar to a monoplane, but somewhat larger, passed over Cincinnati, Ohio at an estimated altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. The object was observed by several persons in the area and the sighting lasted approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The object appeared to emit a glow that was described as being a bright luminescence. It moved in a steady course and at a steady speed without any variation.
