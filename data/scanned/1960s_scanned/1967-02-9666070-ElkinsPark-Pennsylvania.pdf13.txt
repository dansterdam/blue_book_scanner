The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document states:

THAT OBJECT WAS THERE.  
I SINCERELY HOPE THAT  
YOU GIVE THIS CASE SOME THOUGHT.  
I'M ABOUT TO FEEL FREE TO CONTACT  
ANY MORE INFORMATION.  

CORDIALLY MAY  
YOURS,
