While at the station, Lt. Anderson asked me to watch by the desk while he was busy on the phone. During this time a couple came in and reported a sighting of a bright light. The man said he was parked south on 26th street and saw a bright light pass over the house across the street to the north, and then come back by again. The light seemed to be about 40 to 50 feet off the ground. The witness seemed very sincere, and said they had never seen anything like it before. They gave the following account of the incident:
They were in their car and were parked on 26th street. They first noticed the light coming from the southwest and passing over the house across the street to the northeast of them. They were sure it was not a plane or helicopter, but rather a round, bright white light. After passing over the house, it turned and came back again. They watched it for a couple of minutes. They said the light was about 40 to 50 feet off the ground, and that it seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. It was a very bright white light, not blinking. They said it did not make any sound. After watching it for a couple of minutes, it suddenly took off at a very high rate of speed in a southwesterly direction and disappeared from sight. This offense is declared:
UNFOUNDED[] FOUNDED[]
