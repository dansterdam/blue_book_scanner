The image contains two diagrams. The first diagram is a compass rose with directions labeled. The second diagram depicts a person standing on a road with mountains or hills in the background. There is also a smaller inset diagram showing a similar landscape view.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X AT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE BEGINNING WHERE FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "T" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE DISAPPEARANCE POINT.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "T" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE X AND T WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATELY SHOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "T", THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS ITEM.
