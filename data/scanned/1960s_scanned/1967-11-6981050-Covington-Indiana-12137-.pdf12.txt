The image appears to be a black and white photograph, but it does not contain any discernible objects or shapes that could be identified as a UFO or other significant detail. The image appears to be a blurry, grainy photograph showing some textured or patterned surface, possibly wood or some other material. There are no human faces or identifiable individuals present in the image.

CASE NO. 12137
DATE 6 NOV 1967
LOCATION COVINGTON, INDIANA
INVESTIGATOR JOHN KOVACS

SUMMARY:
Mr. James Ruble, a local resident, reported observing an unidentified flying object in the sky near Covington, Indiana on the evening of November 6, 1967. The object was described as round in shape, approximately 30 feet in diameter, and emitting a bright light. It hovered silently for several minutes before rapidly ascending and disappearing from view.

Mr. Ruble stated that he was able to obtain a photograph of the object, which he provided to the local authorities. However, the quality of the photograph is poor, and no definitive conclusions can be drawn from the image. The case remains unresolved, and no further information is available.
