The clipping mentions that a "little more light was cast today on the identity of the mysterious objects" seen in the eastern suburbs the previous night. It also mentions a neighbor who has been observing the balloons for about a year. The reason for the "muffled explosion" observed on Monday night is still unclear, and the balloonist was unavailable for comment.
