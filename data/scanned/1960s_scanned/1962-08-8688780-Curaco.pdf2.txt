Dear Gen.Ramey,

On the evening of 14 Aug.1962 we received information that objects of a metallic nature were being observed in the sky over Curaco. We were requested to investigate this report as our personnel had a great interest in the subject of UFOs. We dispatched a patrol car with instructions to proceed to the site and make a thorough investigation.

The patrol car located a large, metallic object resting on the ground. The object appeared to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was glowing with a reddish-orange hue. The object was under close observation for several hours. During this time, several smaller objects were observed leaving the main craft and returning to it. Our personnel were not able to approach the object due to the intense heat and glowing nature of the surface.

We would like to maintain close liaison with your office and keep you informed of any further information that may come to our attention. Please let me know if you would like any additional details with regard to this incident.

Sincerely yours,
Roy F. Dardanelli
