Dear Sir: Three months ago when I was stationed at Galena AFS, Alaska, I observed a very strange object that glowed with a reddish color. This object was about 40 degrees above the western horizon. I observed the object for about 20 seconds and then it went down behind a row of trees by my house. The next day I went to the area where I had observed the object and there was no physical evidence that could be observed. The time I saw this object the sky was clear of all clouds. The time was about seven p.m.

On the sky, the object seemed to go forward then backward and then straight down. If possible, I would like to get a picture of where the object hovered. Could you please send me some information on what to do and if I see this object again.
