The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed page from a report or document related to a UFO sighting or investigation.

The text in the document is as follows:

1. A star could be seen over a telephone pole and could be used as a comparison.
2. The comparison took about 5 minutes.
3. This small bluish picture is the bottom of the object. Its trail was not seen clear and this may be a reflection and not the actual trail.
4. Film used: Kodak XX.

It should be noted that while watching for these objects, no photographic or binocular instruments were used.

It is my opinion that this report is accurate as possible, and describes as well as possible what I observed.

Anyone desiring to speak to me or offer a suggestion as to the nature of the objects described, contact:

Photos will be forthcoming.
