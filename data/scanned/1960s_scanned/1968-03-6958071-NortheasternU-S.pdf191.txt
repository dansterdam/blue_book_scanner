UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
PHILADELPHIA 4
1968 Oct. 9

Flower and Cook Observatory 
Dear Col. Quintanilla:

This morning I was working on the corrections for a fireball and was about to put the corrections for Kitt anning in. To my dismay I suddenly remembered that I had put it in with a 3 min. 30 sec. error in the orbit I sent you so please hold publication until I correct this.

Fortunately this error I made does not effect the atmospheric path at all, nor the computed distance to the radiographic path, the error changed only the altitude of the terminal point and the parabolic orbit.

As I believe you plan to publish until after 1969 begins, I suggest you do not be serious - it is a hope that you will accept the corrections I sent you only for ten days and let it off to you. As said before, no other significant changes in the paper. Only from the radiant coordinates on, will changes be needed.

I naturally regret this, but for some years now do all my work alone, and have no one to check with me. This inevitably leads to some errors, which are not so rare. I found by me.

Sincerely yours,

Newhenth, Pa. 19072
