[Handwritten text]
At first I was uncertain as to whether or not I should call this in, since the incident was not of a sensational nature and there was no immediate danger. However, I felt that the information might be of interest, so I decided to report it.

To go into more detail:
The object was approximately 100 to 150 feet in diameter, round and flat on the bottom, with a domed top. The color was a whitish-silver, and it appeared to be free of markings, ports, or protrusions. It seemed to be moving at a slow to moderate speed, and at no time did it appear to make any evasive maneuvers or abrupt changes in direction. The flight path was a relatively straight, horizontal course. The object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before moving out of sight.
There was no noise or trail of any kind associated with the object, and it gave no indication of having been under any kind of propulsive power. It seemed to float or glide effortlessly through the air.
There were two other people with me at the time, and we all observed the object together. After it had gone, we discussed it briefly but none of us could offer any plausible explanation for what we had seen.
That's about all the pertinent information I can provide. I hope this report will be of some use to you. Please let me know if you require any additional details.
