"U.S. Files to Draw GM Into Accident Suit
BY MORTON MINTZ
Washington-The United States is seeking to bring General Motors into an accident lawsuit involving a 1961 Pontiac Tempest sedan in which the government says the car's safety features were faulty.
In a brief filed in U.S. District Court here, the government contends that General Motors should be found responsible for an accident last July 11 in which a pedestrian was injured.
The government is being sued by a woman who was seriously injured when the Pontiac struck her as she was crossing a street in Baltimore. She contends that the government should be held responsible because its General Services Administration had approved the Pontiac for government use.
The government counters that if the woman's claim is valid, GM should also be found liable for the alleged defects in the car's safety features.
The brief says the government "has not yet determined the precise legal theory under which it seeks to implicate General Motors" in the case.
But it says this theory would be based on GM's alleged failure to provide an "adequately safe" car.
The accident occurred on July 11, 1965, when the Pontiac, which was being operated by a U.S. Forest Service employee, struck Mrs. Katherine Earl Eckleton, 63, of Baltimore, as she was crossing a street. Mrs. Eckleton suffered leg fractures and other injuries.
She filed suit against the United States, contending that the government was negligent in its operation and maintenance of the car. The government denied liability and said the accident was caused by Mrs. Eckleton's own negligence.
The government now seeks to bring GM into the lawsuit, saying that if Mrs. Eckleton was injured because of defects in the car's safety features, GM should be held responsible.
The brief does not say precisely what alleged defects in the Pontiac the government believes caused or contributed to Mrs. Eckleton's injuries."
