SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: Hq USAF SAFOI (Mr. Galaser)

On 13 July 1964, MCCLURE, OHIO, reported a sighting of an aircraft that he considers to be a possible UFO. The sighting occurred at approximately 2210 hours (10:10 PM) EST on 13 July 1964. The object was described as a bright, white light that appeared somewhat larger than a star. It was observed in the southeast sky, maintaining a stationary position for about 15 minutes, after which it moved off to the east at a high rate of speed and disappeared. The object exhibited no visible means of propulsion. The observer states that the object was observed by several other persons in the area, but I have no additional information on the number of observers or their description of the object.

This sighting is of interest in that it was made by a mature and reliable observer who is associated with a known military activity. It is likely that Mr. MCCLURE has had some experience in observing aircraft. The area is sparsely populated and it is considered a possible aircraft observation site. This office would appreciate any additional information your office can provide on this sighting.
