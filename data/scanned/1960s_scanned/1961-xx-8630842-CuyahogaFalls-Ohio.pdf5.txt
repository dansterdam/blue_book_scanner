DAVID E. DAUTHERS, DIRECTOR

8 June 1961

Gentlemen:

I write to report that the Air Force has prepared a classified letter concerning a sighting made by Captain William Huie and observers at the Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, Nike-Ajax missile site on 8 June 1961.

In brief, the facts as I know them are that the site was put on alert at about 12:30 A.M. on June 8th, when observers sighted a brilliantly lighted object in the sky over the area. The object was maneuvering at high speed and appeared to change color. The Air Force has classified this incident as a UFO report.

May I point out that Section VII, Paragraph 33, of JANAP 146(C) states that information concerning UFO sightings by military personnel is to be handled through official Air Force channels. I understand, of course, that these restrictions are intended for security reasons, and I do not wish to obtain information that would be in violation of these regulations. However, since concerned citizens interested in UFO research have normally been cooperating with the Air Force, it would be most helpful if you could provide me with any further unclassified information about this particular incident.

I would appreciate, for the sake of clarification, please inform me as to what extent the details of this sighting have been publicized, if at all.

Sincerely yours,
[REDACTED]
