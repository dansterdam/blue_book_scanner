Gentlemen:

I am 47 years old & am sending you a sighting of a U.F.O. which I have
just encountered at about 7:30 P.M. May 10, 1968
about 4 miles north of Syracuse
Ohio.

As I was traveling on Highway 33, I sighted an unusual object in the
sky. It appeared to be circular in shape & seemed to be approximately
40-50 feet in diameter. The object was hovering or drifting at an
altitude of 500-600 feet. It had multi-colored lights flashing on & off
in various patterns & the object was illuminated from within. I watched
the object for approximately 3-5 minutes & noticed that as I got closer,
the object began to increase its altitude & speed. I decided it would be
best to stop & observe the object rather than to continue driving. As I
stopped my car, the object accelerated at a very high rate of speed &
disappeared from sight. I am certain the object was not an aircraft,
satellite, or any other known object that I am familiar with.

I hope this information will be of some value to your investigation. If
you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
