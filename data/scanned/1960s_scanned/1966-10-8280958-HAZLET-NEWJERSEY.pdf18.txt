"Dear Sirs,

On Monday, October 10, 1966 there occurred a most unusual sighting of an unidentified flying object near Hazlet, New Jersey. The object was first observed at approximately 7:30 PM as I was driving along the Garden State Parkway and very shortly after just under the influence of Pegasus and a very bright star. At first I thought it was merely a reflection of some type of aircraft on the south east horizon, but as I continued to observe the object, it became quite apparent that it was not any known type of aircraft. It hovered for a few minutes and then commenced to move in a northerly direction. The movement of the object was from south east to north west. The movement was slow and steady and the object appeared to be about the size of a small airplane. As the object continued on its course, there seemed to be no sound or any apparent means of propulsion, and there was no blinking of lights as on a conventional aircraft. At the time I saw the object, there was a slight haze in the atmosphere and visibility was not too good. However, I was able to observe the object clearly and distinctly. From the time I first observed the object until it disappeared from view, it took approximately 3 to 5 minutes. They gave off no light, but any apparent illumination, and I have never seen anything like this object before.

Sincerely,
[Signature]"
