November 19, 1963

Dear Mr. and Mrs. [Redacted],

This is in reply to your letter of November 8, 1963, in which you inquire concerning a sighting by your neighbors on October 19, 1963.

The report of this incident has been reviewed, but as indicated, the unidentified flying objects seen number more than 8,000 and they have been observed at various locations all over the country. Positive identification has not been made in most cases because not enough information is available to determine what they are.

The two reports you mention were given by the Air Force to the University of Colorado for study. This was done because the Office of Aerospace Reports can no longer handle the volume of reports received from the public. The University is making an evaluation of selected reports for the Air Force as part of their contract, and they will report their findings. In the meantime, the files on record in this office are available for your public information.
