The image contains two illustrations, but no photograph.

The first illustration is a compass rose diagram with instructions on how to use it to indicate the directions of a UFO sighting. The second illustration shows two sketches, one depicting a person standing in a landscape with curved horizons, and another smaller sketch of a landscape.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE. CURVES OR ZIG-ZAGS ON THIS LINE INDICATE CHANGES IN THE DIRECTION OF MOTION. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS.
