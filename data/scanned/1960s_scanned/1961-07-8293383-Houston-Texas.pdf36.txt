Transcription of the text:

"just an idea had about - so it was that i was going down the highway and i spotted something that really looked strange. it was a - thing of some kind hovering slightly above the ground and it seemed to pulsate or vibrate in the air. it didnt appear to be solid as far as i could see but more like some sort of energy form. it was definitely not a helicopter, plane or any known type of aircraft. i slowed down to get a better look but as soon as i did, it just seemed to disappear. i would swear to it as the truth but i know no one will believe me. i just dont know what i saw but i know it wasnt normal. i wished i could have gotten a better look at it but it was only there for a minute or so. i tried to follow its path but it just vanished. i have told a few people about this but they seem to think im crazy. i know what i saw though and i can only wonder what it was and where it came from."
