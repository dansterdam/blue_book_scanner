one startling feature alone the end - bright, soft glow beneath the object, I was not watching on  arrival at scene, but walked over to see object not over 800 feet from my location. observed to descend slowly, lights went out as landed. object on ground about 20-30 feet in diameter. approached to within 50 feet, unable to account satisfactorily. noted domed or conical top. base appeared to be slightly convex, grey-white in color. no windows, ports, or markings visible. remained on ground about 4-5 mins. then relit, rose vertically and disappeared in seconds at a terrific rate of speed. leaving no vapour trail. whole observation about 10 mins. went home and reported immediately to authorities.
