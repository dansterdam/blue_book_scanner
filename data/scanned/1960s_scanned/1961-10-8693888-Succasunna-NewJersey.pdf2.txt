The image contains three sketches. The first sketch is a curved line showing how a high object would appear above the horizon (skyline) when first seen, and then how it would appear below the horizon (skyline) when last seen.

The second and third sketches depict the same landscape scene, with a person in the foreground. The second sketch shows the position of the object when it was first seen, marked as "A", and its position when last seen, marked as "B". The third sketch provides a more detailed view of the landscape.
