The image contains a sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch shows a diagram with an object or objects in the sky and various angles and direction indicators. There is also text below the diagram providing instructions and questions related to the sketch.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line that shows the highest elevation at which the object was seen. Place a "B" on the horizon (skyline) where you first saw it. Place a "C" on the low point on the curved line where you last saw the object.

28. Make a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a sketch of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were moving.
