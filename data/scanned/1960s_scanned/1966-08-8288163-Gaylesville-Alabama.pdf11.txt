The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing a factual observation of unidentified objects. The text in the document is as follows:

(there was a 3/4 full moon), which was behind me and shining over my left shoulder. The objects were first sighted at 8:55 (+ 1/2 min) in CST (no daylight saving time).

when I went down the window, the objects were in clear view, and no discernible sound could be heard during the observation. the objects produced

FACTUAL OBSERVATIONS:

(1) The objects were sighted when directly behind the moon, when distance could not be determined. The diameter of objects was from 1/3 to 1/4 that of the moon.

(2) The objects' formation increased in size approximately seven to ten times.

(3) The time of final observation was 8:55 pm CST + 1/2 minute.

(4) The objects were circular.

(5) The triangular pattern was maintained by the objects for the duration of the observation.

(6) The light received by us was orange-yellow when they were at maximum size and bright white when first sighted.

(7) The objects made a smooth maneuver, turning from East to West.

(8) There was no noticeable wind on the ground and visibility was excellent for that time of night.

(9) The moon was bright and about 3/4 full.

(10) All objects were of equal intensity and were glowing when closest. (The center object was slightly a shade brighter than the outer three.)

(11) There was no detectable sound produced by the objects.

(12) When the objects reached their furthest position, there was a definite decrease in the intensity of the light. This corresponds to the center and three outer satellites being seen at their closest visual position. This was significant enough that it was noticeable; I didn't think that this was important during the observation, but the Physics Department said that this could be a result of the light being out of focus but still being held together by interference. 

*This statement was sent to the Air Force the next day as an appendix to official report. I believe it to be the most significant factual observation.
