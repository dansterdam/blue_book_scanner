Angular measurable bright luminous irregular object
Moving  Vertical rock twice seen Approx.
4 to 5 seconds.  Diminishing gradually at a longer range.
The object had a very bright lighting and seemed to have an irregular shape.  It was moving rapidly and ascending at a bright mirage-like rate upwards.  The speed appeared to be much greater than regular aircraft.  The object did not reflect light and moved in a controlled manner.  As it moved out of sight it appeared to contract and become more intense.  It was observed for a longer period than the initial sighting.  I wondered if it could be some form of plasma or a rare meteorological phenomenon, but I'm not sure.  Step - affirmations - this is not a routine sighting.
