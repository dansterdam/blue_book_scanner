The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a blank space with instructions for the witness to "Draw a picture that will show the shape of the phenomenon" and provide details about the movement and appearance of the observed object. The document appears to be a form or report from Project Blue Book, likely used to collect information about alleged UFO sightings.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:
