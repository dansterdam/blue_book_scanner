The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. It contains no photograph, but rather several horizontal lines or streaks that may represent some kind of visual information or data related to a reported UFO sighting. The text at the top of the image appears to be handwritten and says "Proj. Blue Book Waldwick, N.J. 7/7/67".

Project Blue Book was the name of the official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects. The document appears to be related to a reported UFO incident that occurred in Waldwick, New Jersey on July 7, 1967.
