Project Blue Book

Feb 11 '67
Dear Sirs,
As one of my friends would say to you, "About your Blue Book, I have been to too'. Like this:
It was Feb 11, 1967 about 11:25 PM EST. I saw this UFO saucer, just like it says in the books. It was a saucer-like object, with a motor-like sound. It was abo't 100 ft. up.
At this point I'm saying to myself, 'This is really something. I only wish I had a camera to take a picture.'
It's dark, I know, but I can see it quite plainly. It seemed to be about 40 feet across. I watched it for about 2 minutes. Then it just went straight up and disappeared. Think you very much for any light you can shed on this.
