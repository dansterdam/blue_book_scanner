The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO document. It contains a sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The diagram includes instructions for the viewer, such as indicating where to place a "B" on the compass to show where the object was first seen, and instructions to draw a picture to show the motion or direction of the object(s).

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the image, the output is:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon. (Bullseye) Place a "B" on the compass to show where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
