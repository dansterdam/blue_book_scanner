Unidentified Flying Objects

Directorate of Information
9170 Air Division (SAC)
Eglin AFB, New Hampshire 03803

1. Reports which have been received by our organization from individuals in the Exeter, New Hampshire area indicate operation of high-speed, maneuverable objects in the vicinity of that reporting area. Investigation with the exception of the Exeter, New Hampshire report was made. Following analysis of our investigation, no definitive evidence of a positive nature was established to indicate other than normal flight operation. The operations being reported seem to warrant a further "Far Trappers" refueling area and Down Date" refueling operation. It is our belief that aircraft for this operation and various other national air defense purposes are not involved with the operational activity being reported in this area.

2. AFR 200-2 specifically states that only those objects which are undeniably associated with the operation. Therefore, balloons, satellites, aircraft, etc. are not covered by this regulation and such identification may be released. The sighting is not evaluated as a "known or conventional object" when in our opinion the reliability of the observer or other pertinent information is not
adequate to support that conclusion. The release of such information is not
permitted.

3. Investigation or unidentified flying object reports is made only in those cases where the observer contacts the Air Force directly. Information is not interchanged with any other governmental agencies as rumors are carefully considered.

4. The Air Force does not, as a rule, provide speakers to private groups on the subject of UFOs. Past experience has indicated that talks on this subject only serve to generate additional requests for speakers and create additional interest in the subject.
