Larger than the biggest match, covering a larger area.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects.

Please an arrow beside the sketch to show the direction the object was moving.
The drawing indicates a round or oval shaped object with a glowing, fiery appearance. An arrow indicates the object was moving from right to left. The description mentions details like "exhaust trails or vapor trails", but none are visible in the drawn sketch.
