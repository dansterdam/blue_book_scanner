Mystery Flash and
Power Failure
On 7 February 1960, at about 2030 hours (Pacific Standard Time) a mysterious flash was observed in the sky over Mojave, California, followed by a power failure in the area. The power failure lasted for about 30 minutes.

The local power company was notified and it was determined that the power failure was not due to any problem with the power distribution system. The cause of the flash and power failure remains unknown.

Witnesses reported seeing a brief, intense flash of light in the sky at the time of the power failure. One witness, a Mojave resident, reported that the flash was so bright that it momentarily illuminated the inside of his home.

The Air Force was notified and investigated the incident, but was unable to determine the cause of the mysterious flash and power failure.
