NEW YORK STATE POLICE
MEMORANDUM

Troop "C" Station: Ithaca
Date: November 17, 1967

To: TROOP COMMANDER, TROOP "C", Sidney, New York
From: Lieut. J.J. Carroll

Subject: Report of Unidentified Flying Objects ("U.F.O.'s")

1. Contacted Telephone, 10/26/67, the Ithaca station and requested to send a patrol to 13 Benjamin Hill Road, Newfield, N.Y. relative to seeing "some lights in the sky". Trooper J.P. TROMBINO was assigned to interview complainant.

2. On 10/26/67, Trpr. J.P. TROMBINO personally interviewed Complainant, age 33, Ithaca, New York, at the residence of a third subject, age 24, also of Ithaca, New York. Complainant and the third subject stated they were at the back yard of the residence trapped in blankests looking into the sky. They observed a flying saucer-like object with a bluish-green glowing exterior. It appeared to be stationary, but suddenly took off at a high rate of speed. All three subjects claimed to have observed the object with many flashing lights, and that the saucer cast small white lights at them. The story was difficult to believe. Upon completion of his tour of duty, Trpr. TROMBINO did observe what appear to be the description given by the subjects in the yard for a short time, but could not determine what the object was.

3. Trooper EISENOERG subsequently obtained a special file ch. from SP Sidney on all three subjects with negative results. During completion of his tour of duty, Trooper EISENBEEG made a blotter entry covering the incident.

4. At 7:20 P.M., 11/1/67, a subject identifying himself as WILLIAM DONOVAN, President of Aerial Investigation and Research Inc., telephonically contacted Sergeant R.J. CARTIER at the Ithaca Station. He stated he was investigating reports of U.F.O.'s in this area.
