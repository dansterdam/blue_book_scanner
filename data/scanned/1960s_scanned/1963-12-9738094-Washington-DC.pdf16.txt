The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing a report received by Captain Quintanilla, who is said to be from the Netherlands Embassy, regarding a UFO sighting over Washington, DC in 1963. The document mentions that the reported phenomena was a "flight of starlings (or which there are millions in this area), most often being chased by a bird of prey."

April 13, 1954

Captain Quintanilla: 
Major Jacks this morning, upon receipt of a UFO Fact Sheet sent to him some time ago. He said that in reading over the 1963 cases, #14 regarding the phenomena observed over Washington, was of particular interest to him. He said that he had seen this same type of phenomena on several occasions. What it was (he reported) was a flight of starlings (or which there are millions in this area), most often being chased by a bird of prey.
