Here is the text output from the document:

The different occasions. The layering effect, plus the inclusion of high moisture could be tentative to indicate that the ice was formed as the result of these more phenomena than the freezing of a steady pond.

It seems highly unlikely, considering the location of the incident; however, the location of formed as the result of water vapor arising from thermal regions of the soil. The presence of strong temperature gradients (80-95F) are necessary to help this process. The vapor rising taking trapped soil particles with it to the upper layers of the soil, where it condenses in the temperature gradient. It appears that the ice has grown in the layered structure, the growth of the layers of ice depend upon the ambient air temperature, water-soil temperature gradient in the soil and perhaps particle size of the soil.

In summary, I find nothing in the evidence submitted with this report which would indicate anything occurring other than as the result of a natural phenomenon.
