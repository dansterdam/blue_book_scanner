Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Our Project Greige at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has investigated your report of an unidentified flying object observed on July 11, 1964. Included with this correspondence is the official report of our investigation.

The investigation indicates that your sighting was of an experimental aircraft from the [REDACTED] Air Force Base. It is impossible to state conclusively that it was a known aircraft, but the evidence suggests it was a recognized military test vehicle.

I understand this may be disappointing, but it is important that we strive to identify and explain all reported sightings. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter, and any additional information you can provide will be helpful.

Sincerely,

MARION M. JACKS
