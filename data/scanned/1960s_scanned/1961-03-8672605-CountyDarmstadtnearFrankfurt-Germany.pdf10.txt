BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The witness while looking out the window saw a bright white object which appeared to oscillate or flutter going in a horizontal direction east to west. The object appeared to be flat and disc-shaped in form. It made no sound and disappeared from view. The witness stated the object appeared to be higher than the adjacent buildings and trees and was about the size of a car.
EVALUATION CASE CATEGORY: POSSIBLE
CONCLUSION: It appears the witness observed a natural phenomenon. The description of the object's movement and appearance are consistent with a balloon or other airborne object. No other substantive evidence is presented to indicate this was an unidentified flying object.
