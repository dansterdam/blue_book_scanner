We saw some lights in the sky. They were moving and blinking and then they disappeared. My friend and I felt they were objects that were not normal. We first saw the object at about 5:15 he lived in Camp Kilmer, NJ. Please send me back your version. When I first saw the object I saw about 7 or 8 of them moving in a line. We were observing stars in which we were amazed.
