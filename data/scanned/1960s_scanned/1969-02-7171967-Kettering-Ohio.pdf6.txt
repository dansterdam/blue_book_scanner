Dear Sirs:
This note confirms you of the U.S. Air Force sighting reported in my letter of February 22, 1967. It was while 75 feet above a cornfield near Kettering, Ohio, I saw an object, a round disc, hovering near the ground. I am not a crackpot, nor am I seeking publicity, for I know that most people will think this incredible. From the experience I had, I am convinced that what I saw was an Unidentified Flying Object and have a few sketches concerning them, but cannot forward them at this time. I have read the various ways you think we may be seeing natural phenomena, but still insist that what I saw was a metallic craft of unconventional design, hovering silently about 75 feet above the ground. I noticed the "thing" outside was a field of cornstalk and it appeared to be circular in design with a dome on top, with a small light on the top. As it began to rise, a bright light emanated from underneath and it made a slight humming sound as it moved away. I realize it might seem rather far-fetched, but I can assure you that it was at a most close to center of way.
