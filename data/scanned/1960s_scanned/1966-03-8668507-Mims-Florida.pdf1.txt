The object remained motionless for about 30 seconds with a varying quite rapidly in color. After the initial sighting the object descended stopping for about half a minute, then descending again. During the descends neither the apparent size nor the color changed. Remaining very bright, it then quickly ascended out of sight in a northerly direction.
