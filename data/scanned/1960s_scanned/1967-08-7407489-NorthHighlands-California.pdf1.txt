PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE-TIME GROUP: 27/05/52
2. LOCATION: North Highlands, California
3. SOURCE: CIVILIAN
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 6-8 minutes 
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-air
7. COURSE: North to South
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: Possible SHOT AIR BALLOON

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observers saw different lights similar to aircraft landing lights or artificial satellites. After the observer had watched the objects for about 30 seconds, the objects intentionally disappeared abruptly. A few minutes later, the objects reappeared and remained visible for some time. The description is exactly as would be expected for a shot air balloon. However, the observers give the direction of travel roughly SE, but wind was (considered) to be NW, which seems very possible that the objects were carried bag.
