SIRS:*
REF: MY LETTER OF JULY 18TH,1963 IN THE REPORTING
OF AN OBJECT WHICH WAS SIGHTED AND THEN FLEW OFF.

ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 13TH, OUT OF CURIOSITY, ON THE EXACT COURSE
AND IN ALL RESPECTS THE SAME KIND OF OBJECT WAS SIGHTED AT APPROXIMATE-
LY 10:40 PM EDT LAST NIGHT (JULY 19TH). IT TOOK A SLIGHT DOWNWARD COURSE INITIALLY AND THEN MAINTAIN ED AN EVEN STEADY COURSE FOR SEVERAL
MINUTES. BOTH THESE OBJECTS CAME FROM THE NORTH IN STRAIGHT COURSE 
AND MOVED IN A SLIGHT DOWNWARD DIRECTION. ON PASSING OVERHEAD IT STOPPED
DEAD IN ITS TRACKS OR TRACKS AND HOVERED MOMENTARILY. IT IS NOT
CLEAR WHETHER THIS SECOND ONE BLEW UP OR MERELY EXTINGUISHED AS NO FLAME 
WAS NOTICED AT THE END.

ON NIGHTS BETWEEN JULY 13 AND 24 NO OBSERVANCE WAS 
MADE SO CANNOT SAY WHETHER THESE WERE ANY MORE FLIGHTS.

THIS WAS SIGHTED FROM A POSITION TEN MILES NORTH OF
KEY WEST ON SADDLE BUNCH SHORES, BOTH TIMES.
