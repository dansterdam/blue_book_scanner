There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten letter or report related to a UFO sighting.

Five days after this experience I notical in the Boston Herald an artitle on flying saucers. It stated that scientists at two Antarctic bases sighted a terns - shaped object in the sky. Response accelertas were manual and maneurevering abilities were mentioned. The same report was sighted at a base in Chile and Buenos aires these officials saw if on Saturday July 3rd. We saw it on Sunday July 4th. Scientific officials verified the story. Whoever has a photo of such an occurrence is requested to mail it back to me with your reply, because if would like to have it. We would appreciate it if you would write back and comment on this and give us all the information possible on the matter.
Sincerely yours,
Yvonne, Mass.
