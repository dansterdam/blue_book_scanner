"World's First UFO Murder

by AL KATZMAN
For Australian rancher Derek Hayden and his wife Mellisa, death came swiftly and with an eerie high-pitched whine out of the sky. "A flying saucer killed them," Territorial policeman Arthur White said flatly when interviewed last week by MIDNIGHT. "We have the evidence to prove it."
The bodies of Hayden, 35, and his 30-year-old wife were found in the kitchen of their ranch home near Borroloola in Australia's vast and lonely Northern Territory after neighbors reported "an enormous shimmering light" hovering in the vicinity. 
The light passed over at about 11:30," neighbor Frank McCullough, 50, told MIDNIGHT. "It was moving slowly so I got a good look at it."
His wife and six other people who work for the ranch say they saw the thing. It was no aircraft or helicopter or anything like that, McCullough said he and others watched the object for more than five minutes.
"But like they'd seen something so shocking and disgusting that they couldn't stand it, it's hard to describe their expressions but I hope I never see anyone with that look again.
"Whole bodies were what you might call 'arranged' they were placed together with the legs together and the arms extended out away from the side of the bodies.
"There were no cuts, bruises, or other marks on the victims - and no indications of a struggle in the room. A police dog belonging to the homestead was also found dead in the room. It was stretched straight out the same as Mr. and Mrs. Hayden. There were marks on the dog it's teeth were bared as though it were growing when it died."
Except for the gruesome discovery of the dead, the Hayden ranch house and the area around it extending for 10 miles in all directions was declared off-limits to neighbors, reporters and curiosity-seekers. Australian Army vehicles and government cars moved into the area and brought detectives and scientists to the scene. After four days of investigations, the bodies of Hayden and his wife were released for burial.
