The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, containing a sketch of a compass and instructions for the witness to mark the direction of the observed object.

Here is the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "X" on the compass line to show the direction from which the object (or objects) first appeared. Then place a "T" on the compass line to show the direction in which they last disappeared. If more than one object was seen, place an "X" and a "T" for each one, when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object(s).

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how were they arranged? Draw a picture to show their arrangement, and put an arrow to show the direction they were travelling.

Current knowledge is limited to discuss details in any photographs which may have been present, as the given image does not contain any.
