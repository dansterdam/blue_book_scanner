The first sketch shows the outline of an object in the sky against the horizon. The second and third sketches show different views or perspectives of the object.

The text output from the image is as follows:

22. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how 
high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to
show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

23. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its 
position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch on an example of how to complete this.
