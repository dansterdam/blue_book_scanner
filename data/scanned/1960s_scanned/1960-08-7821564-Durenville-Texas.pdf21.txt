Dear Sir:

This is in regard to the incident reported to the military of a strange object observed in the sky over Durenville, Texas, on August 25, 1960.

The observers reported a strange hovering object which appeared to be a craft of some kind, approximately 30 feet in diameter, with a white light on the underside and a red light on the top. This object was observed to move in various directions and then disappear. The time of the observation was around 7:30 p.m.

There were two witnesses to this incident, a local farmer and a local business man. Both stated that the object was observed for approximately 20 minutes and that it appeared to be emitting some sort of energy or force field. No sound was reported during the observation.

This type of incident is of great interest to our observatory, as we have had several similar reports from this general area in recent months. We would appreciate any further details you may be able to provide regarding this sighting, such as the exact time, location, weather conditions, and any other relevant information.

Please let us know if you require any additional information from us.

Sincerely,
