There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a scanned page from an old document, possibly a Project Blue Book report, that contains only text.

Transcribing the text:

"First was too frightened to go out and see what it was. She told her sister, who came out to the house and also saw the object. They both watched it for about 15 minutes, and it appeared to be round or oval shaped, and emitted a bright white light. It did not move from its position in the sky, except for apparently tilting or swaying slightly. After about 15 minutes, it disappeared suddenly, going straight up out of sight. 

Although a thorough investigation was made, no supporting evidence was found to substantiate the sighting. No other witnesses were located and no physical evidence was discovered. The object was not picked up on radar at the time, and no corroborating reports were received from other sources. The Air Force evaluation is that the sighting was probably a hoax or imaginative report.

It is the opinion of the investigating officer that the physical evidence was not sufficient to warrant any conclusion regarding the origin or nature of the aerial object. The statement of the witness and her sister was taken, but there was no physical evidence to support their report. Consequently, the case is considered unresolved and of an unknown nature."
