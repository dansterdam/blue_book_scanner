Date of sighting: Thursday Oct. 6, 1966 at 7:15 P.M.
Duration of sighting: 16 to 12 minutes.
Sky conditions: Clear, little light in west.

Narrative:
Siggers was in car going north out of Arlington. The very bright light in the east was seen to bob up and down rapidly over a core area. Bright objects seemed to be a wheeling, circling, turning on or off; and light approached each other. As light approached, it became so bright we couldn't look at it directly. Observers had stopped their car. Some 20-30 seconds later more bright lights appeared in the sky, and still others moved along the ground.
Observer guessed height at 200 ft? The powerful white light went out, brightness could be seen for perhaps a mile. When the thing was not visible, steady for 10 or 15 seconds, then it started to blink again, seems to move toward the west. That ended the performance. The object was hidden by the low hills during most of the sighting.
