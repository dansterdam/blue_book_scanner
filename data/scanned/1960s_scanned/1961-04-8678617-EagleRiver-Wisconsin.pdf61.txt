Hampshire Sighting
On the 31st of July 1955, at 1:15 a.m., two members of the U.S. Air Force, who were on guard duty at a communications site in Hampshire, England, sighted an unusual object in the sky.

The object was described as being approximately 25-30 feet in diameter and had a pulsating reddish-orange glow. It appeared to be hovering and then moved rapidly away, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.

The two airmen reported their sighting to their commanding officer. An investigation was carried out, but no explanation for the sighting could be determined.

This is a remarkable story as the object was observed at close range by two competent witnesses, who were trained observers. Their story is authentic and the details they provided are consistent with other similar sightings.
