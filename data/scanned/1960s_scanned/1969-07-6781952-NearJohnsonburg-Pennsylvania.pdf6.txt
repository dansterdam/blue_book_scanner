There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document containing a handwritten narrative description of a UFO sighting.

The text in the document reads as follows:

IF INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

On the 26th of May at approximatly 10:30 PM. We were driving home from a visit with triends in Ridgway, Pa. While driving along Route 219 near the little town of Johnsonburg, Pa. I noticed a strange flickering light in the sky. At first I thought it might be one of those small aircraft that sometimes fly over the area. However, as we continued to watch it, we noticed that the light seemed to be hovering and changing color from a bright white to a reddish orange. It seemed to be about 200-300 feet in the air and moving very slowly. We observed it for about 5 minutes and then it suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. It was a quite unusal experience and we have no idea what it could have been. More pictures of the object were taken but are not available to me at this time. I will be happy to provide them if required. The sighting occurred on a very clear night and the object was easily visible against the dark sky.
