I feel that there is much of a interest to me in this report and yet I find it rather discouraging and disturbing. The whole thing of the phenomenon itself is to me quite puzzling in many respects. The visual aspect as well as the apparent mechanical operation, if it can be called that, is well-nigh incomprehensible from my point of view. Its apparently complete disregard of gravity if displayed is startling, and the occasional erratic and almost playful motion is something I find quite baffling and perplexing. I am certainly greatly interested and wish I could understand more about it. The whole thing is rather unsettling to me."
