December 6 1956

Dear Sir:

On the third of December I sighted what I think was a U.F.O.

I am 16 an wright this report after much deliberation.

I live in Beachwood New Jersey.I sighted the U.F.O.s

On Saturday evening December third at about 10:55 p.m. we believe we sighted the U.F.O.s. The time was 10:55 p.m. and we sighted at first what we thought was an airplane it was moving very fast and went up and down, back and forth for about two miles then it darted straight up and toward the east. It was about the size of a star and was shining quite brightly. We probably wouldn't have thought anything of it, but for two more appeared. These were headed north toward the ocean direction from which the first one came. They were slightly smaller than the first one. They were bright in color and were moving very fast. They would stop then go. They were going to fast. They stopped once then continued north until they were out of sight.

I hope I haven't wasted your time. And I hope that this report is helpful.

Sincerely Yours,
Beachwood New Jersey
