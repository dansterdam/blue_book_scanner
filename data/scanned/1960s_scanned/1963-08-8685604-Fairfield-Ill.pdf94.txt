Text from the document:

"Thing I ever saw," said Mr. Lee. 
"It was much bigger than a star
but it didn't twinkle. It just hovered
on the southwest at about a 45 degree
angle 5 minutes. Then it took off
straight up at fantastic speed, although it didn't flicker. Any airplanes
would have flickered."

INCIDENT.
On 1-17-59, Keener, who was
an 18-year-old student at Fairfield
High School, Fairfield, Ill., had an
experience that evening at approximately 8 o'clock.

"About eleven o'clock we looked out and the thing was gone. We could hardly speak to her, and when I looked out the car window to the
southwest the object was nowhere to be seen. That's the whole story."
 
They glanced up and saw it. "Man From Mars"
Probably just an unidentified flying object, but it gave the exciting experience - What was it?

When I'd passed my car up, the object would speed directly up and then 'zig-zag' down, first to the left and then to the right. It was about an inch long.

At first it was on the south side of the road and then it crossed over to the north. It went out over the field and then quickly turned on back. I thought they'd encounter some foreign object or something unusual. When I finally reached the house, my sister, Francine, was standing there. She had seen it too, from the kitchen window. She and I both ran out and watched it through the window. 

Finally, I made a run for the car. That's when the fun really began. 

As I pulled away from the house, the object began to follow me. I could hardly keep my eyes on the road, I was so busy watching it. I was amazed and just couldn't believe what I was seeing. I had never seen anything like it before.

Thought He'd Gone Crazy
