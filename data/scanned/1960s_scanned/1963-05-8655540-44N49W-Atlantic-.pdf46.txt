Astronomers Watch UFO
In Australia

Dr. M. Gliksman, of the Mt. Stromlo observatory, saw a brightly luminous object on May 10, 1962. It was stated that the object was not one of the satellites or planets normally seen in the sky.

The description states that the object was self-luminous and not glowing from reflected light. It was seen to be traveling from west to east, passing almost directly overhead. The object did not change brightness in the 60 seconds it was watched.

The Department of Civil Aviation said no planes were in the area at the time, and it could not have been a meteorite or meteor shower. It appeared to be a large cloud and did not resemble a satellite or planet. The object remained brightly lit for the normal duration of a satellite pass.
