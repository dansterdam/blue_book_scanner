PROBLEM

Public opinion surveys indicate that over fifty million Americans believe in the existence of UFOs today.

For the past twenty years over 11,000 UFO sightings have been reported and examined by the U.S. Government. Yet, no positive evidence has been found that UFOs pose any threat to the security of this country. In addition, the evidence examined denies the existence of flying saucers from outer space, or any similar phenomenon popularly associated with UFOs.

Since the U.S. Government (which does not in fact withhold information from them) is an intelligence organization, the fifty million people who believe in UFOs also believe the Air Force are withholding information from them. This has simply resulted in a greater demand for information (which does not in fact exist) and this in turn has further discredited the U.S. Government and the Air Force.

If fifty million Americans believe in UFOs, it is to the interest of the Air Force to capitalize on this belief.
