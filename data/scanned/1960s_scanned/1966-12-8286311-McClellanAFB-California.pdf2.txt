See, an intelligent officer in the sky. The very small thing discovered was an orange spot disappearing as it came he could to have-me-out of curiosity. I saw it them 60 minutes, but could do nothing to hold it because of its speed. It's speed and disappearance was apparent some distance from me and I decided to write this because I was quite curious about the sighted phenomenon. Needless to say the whole experience or observation made quite an impression on me.
