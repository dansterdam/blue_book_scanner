The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report. I will proceed to extract the text from the document:

Dear Mr. Your letter to the Secretary of the Air Force has been referred to this office.

The recent UFO sightings in Alaska are attributed to a misinterpretation of natural phenomena, conventional objects such as aircraft and/or satellite lights, meteorites, and satellites.

The current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project investigating unidentified flying objects, is the latest chapter since its origin in 1948. Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
