Proposed reply to letter from [redacted] 14 November 1966

Dear [redacted]:

Reference your letter of 14 November 1966 concerning your two observations. In the past three years as chief of Project Blue Book, I have never discounted anyone's knowledge. I honestly believe that individuals must witness an unusual phenomena or else they would not take the time and trouble to report the observation. I know of no lying or withholding of information by the Air Force in regards to the UFO problem; this is a major misconception that has plagued the Project for years.

I want to stress that the Air Force finds itself involved with only subjective data. The only information on which to make a scientific study is that of an observer's own experience or an observer's interpretation of an experience. In no case has there been an instance where sightings have furnished scientific and technological data that could be channeled to Research and Development for their study and utilization. UFOs exist in reports only; there has been no conclusive evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that our planet is being visited by extraterrestrial vehicles.

In regards to your observations, the lapse of time involved before reporting the sightings to the Air Force precludes a comprehensive evaluation. The information will most certainly be added to the present data base.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.
