Transcription of the text:

This was in sight could make and did stay about 1500 feet at very high speed - not very far from us. It caused fear in me and my companion as it hovered and then shot straight up out of sight in about 3 seconds. This looks to me like we had a close encounter with some type of aerial object that could perform maneuvers not possible with any known aircraft.
Sincerely yours
