There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document, specifically a letter from the Office of Information, Community Relations Division of the Air Force regarding a UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

Dear
This will reply to your undated letter, in which you mentioned that you have some information on unidentified flying objects.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it to the address indicated, it may be possible to make an analysis of your report.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest air force base. This allows prompt investigation by specialized investigators who are in a better position to make an on-the-spot evaluation.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the object by consulting the file of photographs and data we are including. We are enclosing these in the event that your report may be similar to some of the reported sightings we have on record.

Sincerely,
Capt. J. Kelly
James K. Dixon
