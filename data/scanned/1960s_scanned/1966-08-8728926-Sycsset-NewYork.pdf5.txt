UFO SIGHTING, 17 August 1966 SEP 27 1966

1. Reference the attached letter from requesting information on an observation which he made on 17 August 1966.
ECHO ECHO ECHO: This individual claims that while driving to New York City on 17 August 1966, at approximately 8:30 PM, he observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be satellite following an erratic course. This occurred at or near Sycsset, Long Island, New York. He observed the object for approximately three and one-half months of its life, before solar radiation dimmed its brilliance. This satellite is not one of those 'cataloged by the tracking device'.

2. According to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalog, there are no known satellites visible which would correspond with the visual magnitude (brightness) as described. If this should prove to be a natural satellite, it is requested that the Space Tracking and Surveillance Center be advised for its responsibility of tracking all satellites and satellite components.
