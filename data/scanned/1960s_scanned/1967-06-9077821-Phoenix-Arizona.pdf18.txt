Dear gentleman,
Incidentally, I had written about a UFO. I had written to me and had stated the "insufficient data." I shall now give you all the information I can on June 19, 1967 at around 10:00 pm. I was evidently a meteor. The sky was clear with moderate atmospheric conditions (it was a clear night sky). However, my house at an extremely high altitude about 3 miles southwest of Phoenix, Arizona. It came straight down and when it appeared, it had an estimated 150-1,000 miles per hour and then disappeared in off 3 times. I did not see an explosion nor heard any sound.
