The Solar Halo Complex of September 17, 1960
Last September 17th, the skies over Oregon were graced with a spectacle that left many observers in awe. Edgar Everhart, a professor at the University of Oregon, photographed an intriguing solar halo complex that day. The halo, which was observed through a 15-inch telescope, had an unusual shape and appeared to be composed of multiple concentric circles. The caption notes that this type of solar halo is a rare and fascinating atmospheric optical phenomenon.
