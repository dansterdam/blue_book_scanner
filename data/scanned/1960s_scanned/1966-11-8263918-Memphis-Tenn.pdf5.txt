ADIABATIC LAPSE RATE ABOVE 20,000 FEET. PARA WHS NONE. PARA THIS INCIDENT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY CHIEF, INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, 97TH BOMBARDMENT WING, BLYTHEVILLE AFB, ARKANSAS 72315. THE PREPARING OFFICER HAS NO FIRM BASIS FOR DETERMINING THE POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THIS SIGHTING. THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT RECEIVED IN WHICH THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT IS SOMEWHAT COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE SO-CALLED "FLYING SAUCERS." THE DEPARTURE OF THE OBJECT FIRST TO THE WEST AND LATER TO SOUTHWEST SUGGESTS A HELICOPTER SINCE THESE DEPARTURES ARE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MEMPHIS METROPOLITAN AIRPORT. HOWEVER, AN EXAMINATION OF A MAP OF THE MEMPHIS AREA DOES NOT SHOW ANY REASON WHY A HELICOPTER SUCH AS MIGHT BE USED IN PASSENGER SHUTTLE SERVICE WOULD BE FLYING NEAR THE POINT OF SIGHTING AT SUCH A LATE HOUR. OBSERVER DISPLAYED A REASONABLE SPEAKING ACQUAINTANCE
