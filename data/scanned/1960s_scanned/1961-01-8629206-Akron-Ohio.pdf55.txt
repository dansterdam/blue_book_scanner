TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

THIS IS AN UNEXPLAINED AERIAL PHENOMENON.
ON 8 JANUARY 1961, SEVERAL CITIZENS OF AKRON, OHIO REPORTED SEEING A BRIGHT, METALLIC, DISC-SHAPED OBJECT HOVERING OVER THE CITY.
THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET IN DIAMETER AND GIVING OFF A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT FROM ITS UNDERSIDE.
SEVERAL WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT MADE A LOUD HUMMING NOISE AS IT HOVERED IN THE SKY.
AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES, THE OBJECT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND SHOT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW.
THIS INCIDENT WAS THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK, BUT NO EXPLANATION FOR THE SIGHTING COULD BE DETERMINED.
