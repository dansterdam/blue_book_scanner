There does not appear to be a photograph present in this page from the old UFO report document.

Transcribing the text found in the document:

them; Mrs.    said she saw four, and Mrs.    said they were hard to count.
Mrs.    added that there was interference with the television picture that
night, and Mr. Bigterly said he could not reach more than four miles on his
police radio which normally makes contact over ten miles.

Second interview: Mr. and Mrs.   (about twelve) and Jeff (about ten). This family had just come from dinner, 
leaving the restaurant about 2000. At around 2010 to 2020, they were on 200
west at about 150 south when they saw two or three lights on the clouds. They
thought they were spotlights on clouds. Driving west on 100 south, they saw
the lights still to the south, but lower; the family drove to 300 west and
turned south, losing sight of the lights at 300 west and about 375 south,
going to three thirty to forty feet fast tell, and about one-half mile away.
The lights still seemed to be three in number, and moved in circles in a
regular pattern.

The lights were last seen at about 2030. When the witnesses were told
that the previous witnesses had reported no clouds at all, the Hillmans were
very surprised, and while they did not contradict the other witnesses, they
seemed to be providing that out of fact more than conviction. Mr.    said,
"I locked up when I got home (about 2040) and I saw a few stars, but I also thought
that there were some clouds..."

These witnesses were located about 1/2 mile directly north of the "poor farm", 
and saw the lights at about 2030, to the south, moving back and forth over
about a thirty degree arc and remaining generally fifteen to twenty degrees
above the horizon. They thought the lights were spotlights, but had evidently
been talked to a bit, since they added that the lights seemed "under" the clouds.
