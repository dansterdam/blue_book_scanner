SUMMARY: (Type, number, maneuver, etc.) W3 McDonald, a pilot, reported a sighting of a very bright, unusual light which he believes was not an aircraft or astronomical object.
a. Description:
(1) Fireball first, and then a large portion of sky was lit up as if from an explosion. There was no sound and some time coloring and smoke.
(2) Fireball was basketball size.
(3) Fireball was brilliant, white. It resembled a strong spotlight.
(4) Only one.
(5) Came straight at me.
(6) My first impression was that a large landing light had been turned on in my face.
(7) No tail visible to see.
(8) No sound; I was flying in a T-33 aircraft.
b. Description of object:
(1) The intense light which appeared to be approaching rapidly. My first thought was that I was about to collide with something and I initiated evasive maneuvers.
(2) Object appeared level with me.
(3) Object was in my nine o'clock, and my magnetic heading was 250Â°. My altitude was 35,000 feet; my ground speed 300 knots.
(4) Appeared to be gaining altitude.
(5) The sequence was this: brilliant white fireball; then a brilliant orange explosion (which silhouetted trees?) and returned to darkness.
(6) Approximately five seconds.
