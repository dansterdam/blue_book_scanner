December 8, 1961

Several persons have reported seeing an unusual light or object in the sky near Humboldt, Saskatchewan, Canada on the evening of December 6, 1961.

The report indicates that the object was first sighted at approximately 7:30 p.m. and was seen by several witnesses over a period of about 30 minutes. The object was described as a bright light, possibly rotating or spinning, that maneuvered in the sky before disappearing from view. Some witnesses reported that the object seemed to increase in size and then decrease again during the observation.

No photographs or other physical evidence were obtained. The Air Force is investigating the reports to determine if the sighting can be explained as a known object or phenomenon.
