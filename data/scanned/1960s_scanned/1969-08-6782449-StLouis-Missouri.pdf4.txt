The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing handwritten text.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Back outline report on the case. The two times sightings were reported by the busi-nessmen in the air - the object was descri-bed as a round ball of light that would appear suddenly, hover for a few seconds and then disappear quickly. The object was quite large, estimated to be about 75-80 feet in diameter. The object did not appear to have any wings or other visible means of propulsion. On the second sighting, the object was observed for about 3-5 min. and this time it was said to have a slight orange color to it.

I want the investigator to note that several witnesses reported that the object had absolutely no sound,it was completely silent.

Approximately 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. at least one half dozen sightings were reported over the specific area. Many of the reports described the object as being the same as the previous descriptions.
