Text extracted from the document:

DEAR

This is in reference to your letter of February 9, 1962. The information you furnished has been carefully analyzed and the results are as follows:

Our preliminary investigation has disclosed no information tending to support the reported sighting of an object over your area. There is no evidence to indicate that an unusual aerial phenomenon occurred as described in your letter. Efforts to establish the identity of the reported object have been unsuccessful.

As previously stated in our letter of January 10, 1962, the Air Force has thoroughly investigated all reliable reports of unidentified flying objects that may pose a threat to the national security. The investigation has thus far failed to disclose any evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial vehicles. All reports are carefully analyzed and their significance weighed by scientific personnel attached to Project BLUE BOOK, the Air Force study of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

MILTON W. ROSEN
