PHOTO ANALYSIS OF UFO, 13 JANUARY 1967
Cleveland, Ohio 44104
Your Reference your unidentified photograph of 13 January 1967.
Your photograph was examined by photo analysis personnel with the following findings:
a. Examination of the mounted negative has negated retouching.
Source indicates the two "objects" were not visible when the general camera exposure was made. Flaws in the original emulsion and slight illuminated sillouette, and exhibits much higher definition than any subsequent retouched imaged, indicate this any conventional darkroom technique. The additional faint images are located below and adjacent to the two "objects" appear to be merely accidental illumination to the camera plate during exposure.
b. We are returning your original color negative; thank you for permitting the Air Force to analyze your negative.
