This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page includes instructions for sketching the motion of an observed object or objects, as well as a question about whether there was more than one object observed. The page also includes a compass rose diagram.

Here is the text transcribed from the image:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

90°
75°
60°
45°
30°
15°

NW NE
W E
SW SE

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

No motion at all.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
