The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a government investigation into UFO sightings.

The text in the document reads:

Re: Questions 2 & 3. - First noticed object from our front window (facing east) at 9:45 p.m. I watched it for a few minutes. Again from our kitchen window (facing west) at 2:45 a.m. I watched object again for a few minutes. It was the same object because of its color, brightness, shape, etc. I called my son to look at object. We watched it steadily & decided to phone U.P.A.F.B. locally. I made notes after calling the base. I referred to these notes when filling out this report.
