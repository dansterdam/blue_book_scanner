UFO SUMMARY (Rehoboth, Mass. 3/30/66)

Full moon and he stated that it would have been much larger than the size of the moon.

He estimated that the UFO was about 3/4 mile away when he saw it as it came from behind some trees. It was oval in shape and stationary and about 40 feet in diameter. An intense light beam was coming from the bottom of the object and it illuminated the ground in a broad area into the southwest. A will-o-wisp type of flame would appear and disappear around the object. His estimated duration of the sighting was about 3 minutes. He became concerned for his safety and the safety of his dogs and he decided to leave the area. As he was leaving, the object suddenly rose up and disappeared into the western sky.

EVALUATION:
It is quite apparent that all three groups of witnesses sighted the same object. Their descriptions were substantially the same. The characteristic bright pulsating red light and the stationary nature of the object for a period of time leave little doubt that they were all reporting the same phenomenon.

The unknown object referred to, however, should be classified as unidentified. It is particularly significant that three separate groups of witnesses spread over some distance reported essentially the same object and characteristic. No other natural or manmade explanation for the sighting is apparent.
