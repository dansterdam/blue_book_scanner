The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text transcribed from the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How long did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length. How many lengths of the object would fit across the diameter of the match stick or pencil? If you had performed this test at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match, pencil, or hand?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the apparent motion of the object or objects, which you should do in the same sequence as the appearance as the object.

The document appears to be a questionnaire or form used to gather information about UFO sightings as part of Project Blue Book.
