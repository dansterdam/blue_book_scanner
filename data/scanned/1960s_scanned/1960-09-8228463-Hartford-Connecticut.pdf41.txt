THE BLUEJOK REPORT

SEPTEMBER, 8 1960

HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT

At 3:45 a.m. on the morning of September 8th, 1960, Mrs. Mary Jones of Hartford, Connecticut reported seeing an unusual object in the sky. Mrs. Jones stated that she was awakened by a bright light shining through her bedroom window. Upon looking outside, she observed a large, disc-shaped object hovering approximately 200 feet above the ground. 

The object, which Mrs. Jones described as silver in color, was estimated to be 50-60 feet in diameter. It emitted a pulsating glow and made a faint humming sound. Mrs. Jones watched the object for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

The Hartford Police Department was notified, and officers were dispatched to the scene. However, by the time they arrived, the object had already left the area. No other witnesses were found, and no physical evidence of the incident was recovered.

This case has been classified as "Unidentified" in the Project Blue Book files. Further investigation did not yield any conclusive explanations for the sighting.
