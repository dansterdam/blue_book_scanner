The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely part of a report from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation into unidentified flying objects.

Text from the document:

"They" said it was a star.
(Most stars don't wiggle and jerk around though.) (Same said it was a satellite, but they don't move fast and forth, and change color, and come and go so low as we can see the shiny stuff that they're made out of.) After awhile my brother went out and we couldn't see it anymore.
