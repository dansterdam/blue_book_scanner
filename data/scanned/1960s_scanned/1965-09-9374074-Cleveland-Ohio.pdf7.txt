The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document that describes a UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

"The first two minutes saw no motion of the object as the witness watched through the 3 x 4 binoculars, that were focusing very well, and he had ample opportunity to observe its configuration carefully. The object took a straight-away trajectory as it moved swiftly over the horizon, disappearing from view. Approximately 30 seconds later, the witness observed a similar object, same color and speed, follow the exact path of the first object. The witness told him that they received another call about some strange and unusual object in the same area and at about the same time, but that he had not been able to view it from his location."
