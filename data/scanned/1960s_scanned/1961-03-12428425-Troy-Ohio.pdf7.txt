Dear Sir:

Last summer I saw a television program while I was vacationing in Michigan, which emanated from Lansing, Ann Arbor or Kalamazoo, Michigan and which dealt with the subject of unidentified flying objects. This was a program sponsored by the Air Force for public information. It was extremely interesting and brought to the account included the observation of our own Wright-Patterson A.F. Base Personnel. The Project was referred to as Project "Blue Book".

I have contacted the "field" in Dayton on this subject and have been referred to you. I would like to obtain copies of any films - either motion picture or stills - to talk to us about this subject. Last year we were given a very interesting account of this subject and we would be able to advise or assist someone from Dayton to speak to us on this subject if you would give us a February 21st or 22nd, 12:00 o'clock noon, with the program starting at approximately 12:00 and lasting about 50 - 100 Rotarians and guests in attendance from this area.

May I have an early reply and please be assured that we will appreciate your assistance in this matter or any suggestion for a program of this nature from Wright-Patterson A.F. Base.

Yours truly,
THE GUMMED PRODUCTS COMPANY
