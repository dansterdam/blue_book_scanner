The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document discussing the "after-image theory" and observations of red lights in the sky. The document mentions that the author has "tried repeatedly to recheck" the information and has found the observations to be consistent with "good transparency" and nothing anomalous. The author seems to be addressing this letter to someone, expressing appreciation for their time and consideration.

Here is the text of the document:

eliminate the after-image theory, as appealing as it is, since my experience with after-image has been that the spurious object will always appear where the original light source was and never at the true position of the light source which the eye retains and transposes.

I think the main misunderstanding, leading to the after-image theory, was that I had used the red flashing light and then immediately looked up into the sky. If this were the case it would be quite consistent to have dismissed the whole matter without another thought, since after-image is such a familiar experience to all of us.

As I believe I remarked, I have tried repeatedly to recheck this sighting, and I give a complete report on the nights when the sky has been of good transparency, and there has been nothing of the sort observed.

Still, in all, considering that after-image of red light is almost invariably present, that the crescet shape, the exact contour of a flashlight shown on setting circles from some distance, being semi-circles on the sky being intense-ly black, and being an experienced observer, the conclusion is irresistible and I think you can close the case on that note.

But damn that series oscillating! I list it as the number one factor, please remember, and it stalling alone would be sufficient to have launched all this inquiry.

Oh well. I wish to thank you sincerely for allowing me to impose on your valuable time. It is certainly a mark of greatness common to men of your standing that you will entertain even the occasional cranks you encounter, back yard astronomer such as I.

Very truly yours,
