Seem to make a turn, when it made its reverses back and forth at the same speed, as if playing the between two points.

I could not identify the object which had its red glow below, the cloud sailing behind it and a bright flash beam clicked up the clouds, which continued to make changes in its form, gradually became longer and narrower. Its center was about the length of a jet aircraft at this point, which appeared much higher and were of no aircraft at this point. I was not close enough to estimate it's exact size, but it did move all the way to O'Hare.

I apologize for the delay; I had this handwritten in preparation, when I met with an accident (eye-operation) and hospitalization for a while. The description and timing are unchanged.

Respectfully,
