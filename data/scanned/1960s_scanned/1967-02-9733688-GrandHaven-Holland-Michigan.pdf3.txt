In this one-day investigation, many witnesses known to have observed an object on the night in question were not interviewed; the investigation therefore did not result in collecting as complete information as could be drawn are tentative.

It appears certain that the initial sighting by the Undersheriff Investigator at night bright light source or extended diameter, located three miles northwest of Holland and between 15 to 20 miles out into Lake Michigan; its altitude, if the elevation estimate of less than 1,000 feet. The angles of view could have less than 65 degrees apart, probably too wide to be covered by an intense lighting.

Since these sightings occurred at the same time that the object due west from Lake Michigan could not have been the same object; it appears possible that he was looking at Venus, it is not either below the horizon to be seen as a low bank of clouds in the west, prior to sighting the next object, because it disappeared from the westerly position into the western horizon.

The second object which appeared to the northwest, apparently contrasted with the object that had just disappeared over the horizon and came rapidly south and stopped abruptly over the ready access line of sight, convex some three miles from the lakeshore and north of Grand Haven. The sudden, vertical left-to-right movement soon by intermittent, followed by a stop, present.
