Purpose
To review Soviet scientific efforts relating to the problem of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations.

Conclusions
1. There is a comparatively high level of theoretical discussion in the USSR concerning the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the problem involved in detecting these civilizations.
2. Participation of many influential astronomers, radio experts, physicists, etc., in these discussions indicates a considerable importance attached to these problems in the USSR.
3. There is no evidence that practical steps on any large scale are being taken in the USSR to contact or to decipher messages from other civilizations, though there exist small projects, of the size of Ozma in some institutions, notably the Shternberg Astronomical Institute in Moscow.
4. The Soviets have available a number of radio telescopes suitable for an integrated search program, if they choose to begin such a program.
5. Considerable emphasis was made at the Byurakan Conference (1964) on the necessity of a systematic survey of the whole sky in order to locate artificial cosmic radio sources.
