18 MAY 1942

Dear Sirs:

As a result of our conversation earlier this morning concerning the delay of satellites, the following information will be of interest to you.

Sightings and description of objects at approximately 10:00 A.M. on the 25th of April. The duration of the sighting was very short, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The objects were flying in an east to west direction. The sky condition at the time of the sighting was clear. The majority of the objects appeared to be bright lights that seemed to appear and suddenly disappear. The trajectory appeared at approximately 45 degrees and then disappeared in a westerly direction. The description of the objects is as follows: size, approx. 1/2 inch; color, yellow-green.

3. This information may be of interest in the event your records show that any satellite is known to have been in the atmosphere on the date mentioned.

Yours sincerely,

(Mr. A. Cameron)
Air Coordinator

Major General Robert A. Breitweiser,
Assistant Chief of Staff, Air Plans,
