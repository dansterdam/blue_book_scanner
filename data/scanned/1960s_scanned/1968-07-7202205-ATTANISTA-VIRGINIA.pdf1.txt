PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE/HOUR: 20/0216Z
2. LOCATION: ATTANASIO, VIRGINIA
10. CONCLUSION: ASTRO PROS MOON
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The observer stated that "At first there was a small spot in the sky and it grew slowly in size. It held its position for some time and then slowly disappeared. As it grew smaller the second one started to appear the same way." The second one then disappeared like the first one.
COMMENTS: The Investigator felt that the observation was of the moon fading in and out of visibility due to conditions of the ground and out of the 230 deg at the time. Dr. Hynek agreed with our evaluation of prob.s soon through clouds.
