Dear Mr. ---,

Your letter of August 19th has been referred to this office for reply.

Information has been received that a reported sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in your area on August 18th has been investigated. The report indicates that you observed a light in the sky which exhibited rapid movements and sudden changes of direction. While such observations are of interest, they do not provide conclusive evidence that the object seen was of extraterrestrial origin. As you know, there are many natural and man-made objects in the sky which can be observed to move in an unusual manner.

Your interest in this subject is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM F. COLEMAN, JR.
