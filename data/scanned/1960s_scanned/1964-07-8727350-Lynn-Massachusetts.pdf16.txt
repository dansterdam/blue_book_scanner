LYNN, MASSACHUSETTS
REPORT NO. 8727350
DATE: JULY 8, 1964
LAKE SHORE PARK

Investigation - Lake Shore Park 
Visual sightings of possible UFO's, reported to BLUE BOOK by civilian observers.

Witness: Mrs. Edith N. Chesley, 
Age: 53, Secretary, Telephone: CE 6-3927
Residence: 7 Hale St., Lynn, Mass.

DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: 
On July 7, 1964, at 9:20 P.M., Mrs. Chesley observed a white light moving rapidly across the sky from East to West. She described the light as being about the size of a dime at arm's length, and it was moving at a high rate of speed, much faster than any conventional aircraft. The light was observed for approximately 15 seconds before it disappeared from sight.

This sighting was also reported by several other civilian observers in the Lake Shore Park area at approximately the same time.

INVESTIGATION: 
The area was checked for possible identifiable light sources, such as aircraft, satellites, etc. No known objects were observed in the sky at the time of the reported sighting. Weather conditions were clear with unlimited visibility.

CONCLUSION:
The reported sighting of the rapidly moving white light is classified as "UNIDENTIFIED." No explanation for the observed phenomenon could be determined from the available evidence.
