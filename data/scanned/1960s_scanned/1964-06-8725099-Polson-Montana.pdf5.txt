A telephone call was made incident to a report
to investigate in some manner with reference to the
Phillips Air Force base-incident of November 25, 1964.

This came as a result of a companion and I seeing
an object which proved to be very unusual and which
appeared to hover briefly as we were traveling out of
Polson, Montana. We sighted the object as we were
going from Polson to Missoula, Montana. I would like to
state that the object was not a star or a normal aircraft.
It was quite bright, seemed to hover briefly, and then
proceeded to move sideways out of sight. I am somewhat
amazed at the incident and would like to have some
investigation made if possible by your office.

I would appreciate your attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,
Walter Samuelson
