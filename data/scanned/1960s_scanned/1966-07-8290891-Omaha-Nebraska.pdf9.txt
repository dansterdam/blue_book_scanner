Dear Dr. Olivier,

Reference the so-called unidentified flying object reports from the Nebraska area. These sightings appear to be better observations. However, the sightings would be compatible with observations of conventional aircraft.

We still have not received any late reports from the Norfolk, Virginia area.

Any assistance you may be able to provide on the Nebraska sightings would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

JAMES E. MCDONALD, Major, USAF
Chief, Blue Book
