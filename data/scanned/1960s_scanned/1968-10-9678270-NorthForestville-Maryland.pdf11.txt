TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

On October 9th, 1968, at approximately 1930 hours, a resident of North Forestville, Maryland, reported sighting an unidentified flying object (UFO) to the authorities. The witness, whose name is redacted, stated that the object was observed for approximately 10 minutes, during which time it appeared to hover and maneuver in the sky. 

The witness took several photographs of the object, two of which are included in this report. However, the quality of the photographs is poor, and the object is not clearly visible. The witness described the object as circular in shape, with a bright, glowing light emanating from it.

The report concludes that the incident could not be definitively identified as a specific known object or phenomenon. Further investigation was not possible due to the limited information and poor quality of the photographic evidence.
