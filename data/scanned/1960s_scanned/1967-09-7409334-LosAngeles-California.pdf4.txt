The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a memo routing slip from the Director of Information, WARD M. MILLAR, Lt. Col., USAF, dated 23 Nov 67.

The text of the document is as follows:

MEMO ROUTING SLIP
TO: SMLS/Captain Flynn
REMARKS:
Reference your letter of 13 November on SAMSQ Random Reentry Safety Policy. Attached are two items I thought you might be interested in concerning an "object" that dropped into a yard in Hawthorne.
The news query from the LA Herald Examiner resulted in a short story in that paper. Apparently the "thing" was part of a meteorite or something similar and not part of a spacecraft or craft entering the atmosphere.
Major Dupuy's action was to check the object and then forward it to the Foreign Technology Division at Wright Patterson AFB. If desired, submission of information of this type will be made in the future to SMLS.

FROM: WARD M. MILLAR, Lt. Col., USAF
Director of Information
DATE: 23 NOV 67
