The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT SOMETHING WAS SEEN: HOWEVER, THE PRESENCE OF INVERSION CONDITIONS, THE FACT THAT OBJECT REMAINED IN ONE LOCATION FOR OVER AN HOUR, AND THAT SIMILAR SITTINGS WERE OBSERVED IN OTHER SECTIONS OF THE AREA CAUSES ME TO SUSPECT THE PAGE IS PROBABLY UNCLASSIFIED.
SITTINGS WERE CAUSED BY SURFACE LIGHTS BEING REFLECTED OFF THE INVERSION LAYER.
NNNN
