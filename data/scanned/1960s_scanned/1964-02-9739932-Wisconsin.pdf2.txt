Summary report

On February 12, 1964, from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. a commercial airline pilot who was flying at 28,000 feet over central Wisconsin observed a brilliant bluish-white light maneuver in front of and below his aircraft.

The object was larger than a star and moved rapidly from left to right at a high rate of speed. It then appeared to pause for a few seconds, then abruptly reversed direction and returned to its original position. This maneuver was repeated several times.

The pilot reported the sighting to the Milwaukee Air Route Traffic Control Center. He was advised that the object was not being tracked on radar. The pilot was unable to take any photographs of the object.

This report was forwarded to Project Blue Book for evaluation. After investigating the sighting, Project Blue Book concluded that the object was a meteor or some other astronomical phenomenon. The case was classified as Unidentified.
