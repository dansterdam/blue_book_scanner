The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page reads:

"Please if you can, tell us what we saw. I know that you are head of project Blue Book and that your opinion will be most respectful.

Thank you very much.
