The image appears to contain two sketch diagrams. The larger diagram is a compass rose with directional labels, likely used to indicate the direction of the observed UFO phenomenon. The smaller diagrams on the right depict a person standing on a road with hills or mountains in the background, which may be used to illustrate the movement or position of the observed UFO.

TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND AN "O" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "0" WITH A LINE TO REPRESENT THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "0". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN STRAIGHT, CURVED OR SIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS.
