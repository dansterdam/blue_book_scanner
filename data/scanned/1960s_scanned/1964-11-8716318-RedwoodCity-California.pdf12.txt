DEAR MR. ------ :

This is in reply to your observation of an unidentified flying object on 16 November 1964 and the photograph taken of this object.

The analysis and microscopic study of the film indicate that it is a hoax. The photograph was enlarged for your use.

The conclusions of the study after photo analysis are as follows: (1) No true photographic image could be discerned. (2) The exposure time was extremely brief, preventing any clear image from being recorded. (3) If the object depicted in the photograph had been a true physical object, there would have been evidence of a constant density across the apparent image. (4) The density of the image as disclosed by the photomicrography indicates it was produced by optical distortions in a manner consistent with a hoax. The photograph was taken after dark which could indicate intentional exposure designed to conceal its artificial nature, without your knowledge.

From the data presented in your report, we are unable to make a positive identification of this object. For the object was not directly observed by trained personnel, the details of the sighting are incomplete. This indicates an object of tremendous size since the distance to the object is unknown. Details of the location and motion are not included. There were two particular temperature variations recorded during the observation, but these data were not sufficient to draw any identifiable conclusions.

An analysis in the report indicates an azimuth of 20 degrees and an elevation of 30 degrees at the time of the major astronomical disappearance. No major astronomical object was recorded in this position at that time.
