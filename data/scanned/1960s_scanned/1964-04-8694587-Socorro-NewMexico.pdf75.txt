Dear Dr. Hynek:

I may have a lead on the person you are looking for. Within a week or two after your sighting on April 24, 1964, my mother sent me a clipping from the Albuquerque News which told of the person from Datil, N.M. who saw the saucer in Socorro. The clipping was from The Telegram-Herald, Datil, New Mexico and included a picture of the individual. 

As I recall, the man was driving into Socorro at the time. Unfortunately, I no longer have the clipping. I am sure that the person you mentioned from the Telegraph Herald in Datil, N.M. is the same person. 

Yours truly yours,
Robert H. Bullerman
