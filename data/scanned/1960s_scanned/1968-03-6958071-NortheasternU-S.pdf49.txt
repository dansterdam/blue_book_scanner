in view and my curiosity made me "jump to other observations." For an instant, I thought I caught a glimpse of a "metallic look" about the fuselage, and this really made me feel that the "thing" was close! (Later, after the thing was more visible, it seemed as though a faint light reflected on the fuselage.(Perhaps the faint light came from the lights of the city or from the lights of the "thing.")) It appeared to me that the fuselage was constructed of many pieces of flat sheets of metal-like material with a "riveted together look." It appeared to me that the fuselage was not of smooth contour. The gray "windows" seemed to be lit up inside the fuselage. This light seemed to be about the same color as light coming from the windows of our homes. I did not observe anything other than the light in the windows. (It occurred to me that I might see objects or persons, but there was too little time for a good look.) My rough estimate is that 2/3 or 3/4 of the fuselage near the front end, had windows that were lit up. About 1/3 or 1/4 of the fuselage toward the rear end was dark or without lights. I did not observe any blinking lights on the "thing" like we have on our planes. From out of the back end of the fuselage came a wide (roughly about the width of the fuselage) --- long, "grayish-orangish-yellowish" stream of dusty fire. It seemed as though particles of dust were on fire. These tiny sparkles seemed to make up the light from it, and the light appeared to be of quite low light intensity when compared to the lighting from the "windows."

I listened intently for some sound from the "thing" but I didn't hear even a whisper of sound!!! This was the most eerie part of my whole experience!! Certainly, there should be some sound from an aircraft that looked to be so near!! 
It flashed in my mind that perhaps the sound was yet to follow.
