34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 6 - 2 - 66 
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
There are several odd things about the sighting that are not covered. First, the object moved along the horizon for several miles at a constant velocity, and later accelerated rapidly to the north and out of sight. This was not a normal aircraft or helicopter. Secondly, the object had a unique configuration that I have never seen on any conventional aircraft - it was oblong shaped, with a dark color and had no visible wings, tail, or other protruding parts. There were also no navigation lights visible, which would be highly unusual for an aircraft. I do not believe this was any type of man-made vehicle. The object was observed by both my wife and myself, and we are both certain it was not a normal aircraft or astronomical phenomenon. Please let me know if you require any additional details about this sighting.
