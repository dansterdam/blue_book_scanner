The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document. It contains a diagram with a compass and instructions related to observing and drawing an object or objects in the sky. There is no photograph present on this page.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on the "A" line the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on the "B" line the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
