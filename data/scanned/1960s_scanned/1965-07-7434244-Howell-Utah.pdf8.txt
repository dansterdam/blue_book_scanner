MEMO FOR THE RECORD

CALL FROM HOWELL, UTAH, ON DECEMBER 16, 1966.
Mr. [redacted] was on his way to work at 4:30 A.M. when he was three separate lights about 2,000 feet up. Mr. [redacted] said it was about 40 to 45 degrees.
Mr. [redacted] was traveling South and the wind was quiet. He was a bright moving; it hovered a few seconds over the plant where Mr. [redacted] worked and then left. Another light just hovered over the plant, and then left. The third object came over the plant. It was much larger and looked like it had six legs. The whole sighting lasted for about 1Â¼ minutes.
