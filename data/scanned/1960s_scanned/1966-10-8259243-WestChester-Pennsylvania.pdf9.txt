I my wife and I saw an apparition at West Chester, Pa on or about July 28, 1966. My wife and I were traveling to West Chester. Pa from our home in West Grove, Pa. at approximately 10 pm. We were traveling a highway route that parallels route 100 when we encountered this U.F.O. traveling northwest to southeast. It came very close to the car and seemed to be very large. I should estimate it to be 40 to 45 feet in diameter. It appeared to be rotating slowly in a clockwise motion. The bottom of the craft emitted a very brilliant white light that seemed to light up the ground for a considerable distance below it. We observed this craft for approximately 5 minutes as it proceeded on its course, maintaining a constant altitude of 200 to 300 feet. It made no sound and left no trail or vapor, and after reaching a point above the trees it disappeared from sight. We became quite excited as this was our first experience with such a phenomenon. As we reached the town of West Chester my wife commented on the fact that we should report this to local authorities, but I felt it would serve no useful purpose and decided against it. However, I do feel this experience should be recorded as I am convinced that we did see a U.F.O. and the experience was quite real to us.
