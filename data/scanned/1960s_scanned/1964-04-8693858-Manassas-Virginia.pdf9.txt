Text extracted from the document:

May 13, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This letter is in further reference to the sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object you reported seeing on April 18, 1964. 

The time, location and description of this sighting coincide with the release of a radiosonde balloon. The radiosonde train consists of a balloon, a radiosonde package and another intermediate object. Oscillations of the radiosonde package may have caused the object to change shape over time. The release time of the radiosonde train preceded the sighting sufficiently to allow a climb to an altitude consistent with the sighting angle.

It is hoped that this information will answer your query. Thank you for reporting this sighting to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
