The object had flashing lights on the side which kept blinking on and off. The object itself was about the size of a small airplane and appeared to be in the air about 600 to 800 feet above the ground. It was traveling at a very slow rate of speed and appeared to be stationary at times. The object was observed for a period of 15 to 20 minutes and then just disappeared. I attempted to get my field glasses on the object but could not get them focused in time to get a good look at it. The range of my vision in the direction of the object was somewhat restricted due to the surrounding vegetation.
