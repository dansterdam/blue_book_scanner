To whom it may concern:

I am requesting all available information, including reports and photographs, regarding the unidentified flying objects sighted at Washington National Airport on the 12 July 1952.

The unidentified flying objects were picked up on radar by the Washington National Airport Control Tower and the Civil Aeronautics Authority building. They were also visually sighted at the same time.

The Air Force has and by date attempting to interpret them. Did the Air Force ever come up with an explanation - at least report, the government was still puzzled trying to hear from you at your earliest convenience.

Very truly yours,
