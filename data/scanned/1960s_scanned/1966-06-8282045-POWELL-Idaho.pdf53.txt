30 June 1966 received telephone call from Mr. Last night, 29 Jun 66 at approximately 3pm this thing parachuted down the corner of 5m St and Hempl St. It landed right across the street from where they live. They went across and picked it up from the cemetery. Object floated down like a parachute but it didn't have any strings. It was a rubbery stuff. When it was bilowing down it was approximately 3 - 10 ft in diameter. It folds real compact so Mrs. Cordell is going to mail it to our office.
