SAUCER LANDING IN ARGENTINA: On the night of July 13th, several people in a small town of Bahia Blanca, Argentina, saw a strange operation of a "saucer" ship landing near their homes. A picture was taken, just a few days earlier. In the landing incident, which is not described in detail to the article, the UFO gave out a blinding red light for several minutes as it moved about in the sky. Then, smaller objects came out of the larger one, and headed toward earth. After five minutes or so on the ground, the "scout ship" took off again and disappeared in the distance. It left behind scorched earth where it had landed, and traces of a physical evidence, which was taken away by local authorities to be analyzed.
