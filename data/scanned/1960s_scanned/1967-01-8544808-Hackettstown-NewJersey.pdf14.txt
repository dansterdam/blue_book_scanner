34. Date you completed this questionnaire: Feb 20, 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: I had noticed the object in question at approximately 8:15 p.m. on the evening of January 8, 1967. I had been outside when I first observed a bright light in the sky which seemed to be pulsing or flashing at a steady rhythmic rate. I watched this light for several minutes and it appeared to be moving in a northerly direction at a moderate speed. After a period of time, the light seemed to stop in mid-air and hover for a moment. The light then began to fade and grow dim, eventually disappearing altogether. The entire sighting lasted approximately 10-15 minutes. During the time I observed the object, the sky was clear and the weather was cool but dry. There were no other visible aircraft in the area at the time. I have no other specific details to add to the information already provided on the questionnaire form. The sighting was quite unusual and I would be interested in any additional information your office may be able to provide regarding similar sightings or the possible identification of the object I observed.
