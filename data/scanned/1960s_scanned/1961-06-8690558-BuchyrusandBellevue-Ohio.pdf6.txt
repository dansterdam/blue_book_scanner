TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

1. Reference the attached copy of a letter from a principal of a school in reporting unidentified flying objects.
2. The first object viewed by the witness was probably due to atmospheric conditions and the slight star stirring. The object responsible for the third sighting was undoubtedly Venus.
3. The object sighted in the initial experience has been reported to AFD on previous occasions and seems to be due to the identity of this object has been reached; however, it is suggested to be identical.
