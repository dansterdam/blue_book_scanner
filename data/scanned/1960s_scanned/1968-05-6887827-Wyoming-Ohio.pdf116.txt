"Sounds are usually heard at greater distances during the night than during the day. On calm nights the range of audibility of a sound may be as much as 10 or 20 times as great as it is during the day. This effect is due partly to the increased sensitiveness of the ear at night owing to the decrease in the amount of accidental disturbing sounds, partly to the inversion of temperature which commonly occurs on calm, clear nights, and has the effect of bending the sound waves downwards, but chiefly to the diminution of the amount of disturbance in the atmosphere at night."
