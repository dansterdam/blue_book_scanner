BA DARING INTO THE 1963 1963 ON THE EVENING OF 7 AUGUST 1965 OBSERVED OBJECTS VISUALLY AND BY RADAR WHILE DRIVING SOUTH ON HIGHWAY 101 TOWARD SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA.

THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE WHILE HE WAS DRIVING SOUTH ON HIGHWAY 101 APPROXIMATELY 3 MILES NORTH OF THE SAN RAFAEL TURNOFF. HE FIRST OBSERVED THREE BRIGHT OBJECTS HOVERING OVER THE HIGHWAY AT AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 2500 TO 3000 FEET. THEY APPEARED TO BE ROUND, BRIGHT SILVER IN COLOR, AND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A VOLKSWAGEN BUS.

WHEN HE FIRST OBSERVED THEM, THEY WERE HOVERING AND THEN SUDDENLY ACCELERATED RAPIDLY AND SILENTLY TO THE WEST-NORTHWEST. HE ESTIMATED THEIR SPEED TO BE IN EXCESS OF 1500 MPH. THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS.

HE CALLED THE SAN RAFAEL POLICE DEPARTMENT ON HIS CITIZENS BAND RADIO TO REPORT THE INCIDENT AND REQUESTED THAT THEY CONTACT NEARBY HAMILTON AIR FORCE BASE TO CHECK IF THEY HAD ANY RADAR OBSERVATIONS TO CORROBORATE HIS VISUAL SIGHTING. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT LATER ADVISED HIM THAT HAMILTON AFB HAD CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAD TRACKED UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS ON RADAR AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AND LOCATION AS HIS VISUAL OBSERVATION.
