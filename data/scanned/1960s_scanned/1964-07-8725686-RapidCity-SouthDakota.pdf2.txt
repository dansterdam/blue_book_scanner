On 8 Jul 64, 2235L David Moody received a call from Lt Scotte, Base Intelligence Officer, LRAFB, who reported a UFO sighting observed by two local residents in Rapid City, South Dakota. Names of the two witnesses were not given. The sighting occurred at approximately 2225L that same evening. Witness described the object as a bright light with a greenish glow, and that it maneuvered in a straight path and had a bluish glow. The object was seen for approximately 10 minutes. A further check was not made, as Scotte assured him he would be unnecessary since all information was forwarded to Project Blue Book.
