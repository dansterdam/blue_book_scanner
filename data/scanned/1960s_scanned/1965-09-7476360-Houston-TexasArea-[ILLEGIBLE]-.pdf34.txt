1. An investigation in the Houston area since 26 October 1965 for your information only. I do not feel any of these reports justify completion of further investigation and therefore hold the reports until I had enough to forward to you. I will be continuing with this procedure in the future to give you an update of current local investigations immediately after completion of local investigation.
