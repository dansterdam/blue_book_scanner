MOVIE "UFO" REVEALS NEW EVIDENCE

Many readers have written in suggesting I comment on the late movie "UFO". While the movie is itself a fictional dramatization, it does explain the cause for much of the current controversy over the "old has?" being on several recent movies, but as we see it, it is not so much the vintage of the cases portrayed as it is the release of new evidence surrounding these cases, notably the Washington D.C. radar episode of 1952. This is due to the release of the Tremonton and Montana films, long suppressed, for television review. But no one seems willing to tell how such film was finally extracted from super secrecy and why the facts were disclosed regarding the intelligent maneuvers of UFO's over Washington.

The writer of the article, believed to be the Air Force's J. Allen Hynek, refers to this subject, and the writer's reply, dated June 9, 1960, from Major William James is made to comment on the movie "UFO". This movie was not submitted to the Air Force prior to release.

Just as simple as that! The upon seeing it, I find that film does not answer so many questions, as I find that definite analysis of the "Tremonton" film has never been made and it is considered as an unknown. However, we think it prudent to comment that any visible determination in future regarding answers to many UFO problems will come like the advance of a glacier - slowly and with care, for there is so little to go on.

Those who see the film, should be able to determine for themselves if the specks were birds. According to Capt. Ruppelt's late book, the photographer, Delbert Newhouse, says they were not and CRIFO concurs.
