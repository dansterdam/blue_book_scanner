There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a scanned page of text, which I will now transcribe:

the object's bright beam winched off---leaving only a light slowly dying out. The powerful bluish-white light did not re-appear.

A short time later, I arrived at Princeton University, and the very powerful orange light appeared in the sky over the area where the object had been dipped, as witnessed by the chief engineer--whom I pointed to out wednesday night. I saw the orange light at relatively a low altitude.

Incidentally, our night time transmitter engineer an each of these occasions, but from a venturex point of view.

Being a professional newsman, I looked for a possible I had called a P I O at McGuire A F B to ask if VTOL's might be operating in the area. They said ab experimental craft do not normally use the facilities where I was supposed that I write to blue book, but a good idea. Incidentally, I am in terested in aviation with most types of aircraft flying. I am quite convincing time was i observing a conventional aircraft, a satellite plane, or meteor.

Another employee of the radio station says he saw the very low altitude last wednesday night over the city toward the rescue squad. The altitude was estimated at no more than am also say that two F-104's from McGuire suddenly appear pursuit. 

That is about all I can relate about the incident. I have carefully studied each local police department air found they have received no reports from area residents as to why. The object does not make any rapid to excrescencies appear to be trying to make itself an inconsiderable against business with dimming the lights when I turned on mine.

As for myself, I am 57 years old and have a college I have informed my local police department of happenings, but apparently they have not yet seen the object.
