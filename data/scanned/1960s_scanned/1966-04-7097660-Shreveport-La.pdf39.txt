Text from the document:

Thus, just when their picnic was settling down into the cozy stage it was rudely interrupted and the whole thing called off. This one fact above I believe rules out hoax on their part - who breaks up a cozy three couple night time party for a hoax that can only bring ridicule to them. It of course does not rule out hoax on the part of others, but this is effectively ruled out by other factors.

The entire party surged toward the car (a 19____ (?) ). Now, trailing, noticed a light behind him in the sky. (The sky was overcast). The light moved up and down, and when it went down it went behind a ridge which hid from sight temporarily. Two other lights were observed hovering near it. This was no essentially in the opposite direction from that in which they had seen the first set of lights. 

They had got into the car but before key was put into ignition lock, car shock violently from side to side several times. Got car started and backed it up away from parking space and back onto road -- no other cars or people around, way before seemed to indicate. 

Now watched lights moving -- and seemed definitely attached to some object. Alan drew the object --. After car had been backed up, several got on top of car to watch -- but indicated and flashed inside -- frequently willing out screams of fright. They noticed one light to the left or the other three which after about fifteen minutes, moved straight toward them. It came close and stopped. This is the object Alan drew.

A red light descended itself and some around to the left and along "the trees", but above them. 

It would suddenly get out, and then very suddenly flash on nearby. All during the period an all pervasive humming sound was heard. No other noise.

When red light, bright, popped up, over rocky terrain, just about 30 feet
