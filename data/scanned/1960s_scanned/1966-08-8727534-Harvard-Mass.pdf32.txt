27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (altitude) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass rose to show the direction the object was travelling when you first saw it. Place a "D" on the compass rose to show the direction the object was travelling when you last saw it.
28. Draw a sketch to show the position of the object at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there were more than one object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
