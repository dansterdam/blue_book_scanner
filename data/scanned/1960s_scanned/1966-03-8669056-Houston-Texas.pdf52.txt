Dear Sir:
A large U.F.O. has been sighted near Clyde, Ohio. Many people have seen it. Please send me 25 forms like you sent me to fill out for record, so that these people can fill them out for you.
The object was a bright red, looked like a fire in the sky. It was seen to east and then west, and then back east to west. A bright red, looked like a fire in the sky, from far away, moved from west to east, and then east to west. The radio reported that the object was seen in width, so. I would like to send postage envelopes for the reports, as the people do not such envelopes.
Here is a enclosed report by our local news paper.

Space Objects
Seen At Clyde
CLYDE - Were visitors from outer space descending UFOs for a Sandusky visit last Saturday night? Strange flying objects were reported on two occasions.
The first call came to the Clyde police station about 8 p.m. Residents reported seeing a large red object hovering in the sky north of Route 101 and by a Race street woman it was spotted west of the Village police station. Thinking the first was a hoax, they didn't get the name of the first caller. 
The second call came from James Nixon, Race street, who reported his wife had seen a similar object between 7:15 and 7:45 p.m.
The woman from Route 101 reported the "huge red ball" north of Clyde and traveling south.

Thank you,
Sincerely,
