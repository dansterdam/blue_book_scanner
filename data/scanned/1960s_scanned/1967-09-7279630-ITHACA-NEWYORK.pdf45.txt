The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old report document, possibly from Project Blue Book, containing text only.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

"Before, and I do not report this to anyone else
Just march you answered a letter from me and said, as about other things: "the air Force regulation 200-2 does not prohibit air Force personnel from releasing details of unexplained UFO reports. The air Force prohibits the release of information from issuing pressure on the airfighting which they cannot solve." This paragraph has been changed as far as I know it reads:
"Air Force personnel, other than those of the Office of Information Service, will not contact private individuals on UFO cases NOT will they."
Finally, may I have a copy of Bluebook's publication?"
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
