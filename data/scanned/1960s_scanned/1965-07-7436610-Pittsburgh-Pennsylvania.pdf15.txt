UAO On Argentine Border River
On 10 July 1963, within hours of the spotting of the object over Buenos Aires, a group of six people who were swimming on a beach near Colonia, Uruguay, saw a cigar-shaped object over the Rio Plata. The Rio Plata is a 35-mile wide river that separates Argentina and Uruguay.

One of the six observers was Jose Alarcon, 17, of Colonia. He and his companions reported the object to police and said it was cigar-shaped, reddish in color and about 10 meters (33 feet) long. It moved above the river and not far from the beach. Larrauma said it moved upward when he focused it and bent at a slight angle, similar to a jet trail. The other five people, two of whom were adults, confirmed Larrauma's report and description of the object.
