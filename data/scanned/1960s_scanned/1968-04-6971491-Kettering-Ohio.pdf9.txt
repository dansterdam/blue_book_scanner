Stars 2 - 3:30 huge bright light over a highstress situation over Kettering Ohio. Light made sharp turns and moved very fast. It was not a star or any known aircraft or helicopter known to us at that time. It was very unusual and unlike anything I have ever seen before. The light moved away and was gone in a matter of seconds.
