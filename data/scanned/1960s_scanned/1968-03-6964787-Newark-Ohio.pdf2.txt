The sighting occurred at 2045 EST. The object was seen from the highway coming from Newark, Ohio to Columbus, Ohio. The object was sharply outlined, with red, green and white lights. The object was approximately the size of an automobile, and was approximately 900 feet from the ground. This object was observed for approximately 15-20 seconds by me and another witness. No other cars were seen on the highway at the time. The night was clear and there were some stars visible. The object suddenly disappeared in the horizon.
