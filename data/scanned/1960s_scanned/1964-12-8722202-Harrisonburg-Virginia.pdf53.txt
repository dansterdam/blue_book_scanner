The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, describing an incident that occurred on December 21, 1964 in Fisherville, Virginia.

The text in the document states:

December 21, 1964--Fisherville, Virginia-- Guernith Horace Burns reported a 125 foot in diameter and 50 foot high saucer which landed in a nearby meadow for two minutes near Woodrow Wilson Education Center. A high background radiation count was detected by Professor Ernest Cashman of the Eastern Mennonite College at the site the next day.
