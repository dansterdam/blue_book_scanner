Transcription of the text:

I thought at might be a rocket but it was not. I watched the one I have seen go up while I attended military training. However, this was definitely not the same type. I continued watching because the movement was slow and me very fast like the big one I have seen before. I also thought it might be a satellite but my friend told me they don't move that fast from south to north. 

The object is I have seen well sometime. They are the brightest stars I have seen. The sky was completely clear during the entire sighting and the temperature was on the low 60s.

I would like to say very much if you could tell me what it was. I did not look like a rocket or satellite or a little jet which I have seen on many occasions.
