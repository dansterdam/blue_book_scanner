14th. September.

Dear Sir,

I have been doing some research into the U.S.A.F. reported sightings of unidentified flying objects. I write to you in connection with the U.S.A.F. research project in London, and to say that if you would send me all the details on U.F.O.s that have been reported.

Yours Faithfully,
