The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch of some unidentified flying objects or UFOs. There are two main shapes depicted - a pointed, triangular shape labeled "at first" and a flatter, elongated shape labeled "then after". The shapes contain several circular elements, possibly representing lights or other features.

Project Blue Book was a real-life U.S. Air Force investigation into unidentified flying objects, so this image seems to be part of a document related to that investigation.
