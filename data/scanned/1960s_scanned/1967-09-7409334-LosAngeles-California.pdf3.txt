EVALUATION REPORT
Analysis of Rock-like Material

REPORT NO: MAY 6-7  
PROJECT NO: 6912-25
MANUFACTURER:  
SUBMITTED BY: TDET/UFO (Lt. C. L. Marane)

I. PURPOSE: To analyze and identify, if possible, the rock-like material.

II. FACTUAL DATA:
a. The sample was assigned Analytical Branch number 7-1976.
b. Spectrographic analysis gave the following results:
    Light Area   Dark Area
Principal     Fe, Si   Al, Ca, K, Fe
Major        Mg,Na     Mg,Fe,Na,K
c. X-ray diffraction indicated the main crystalline constituent of the dark area to be Fe3O4.

III. CONCLUSIONS: Complete identification was not possible but it would appear that the sample is either slag or a naturally occurring material.

IV. RECOMMENDATION:
None
