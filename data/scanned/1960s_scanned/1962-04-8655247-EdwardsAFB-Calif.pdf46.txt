This page from a Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be text-only, describing the "Glenn Effect" seen in 1954, which was an observation made by rocket researchers of strange phenomena during the flight of rockets.

The text reads as follows:

GLENN EFFECT SEEN IN 1954

New evidence from stereo pictures taken by rocket eight years ago had been reported on by Hilary Sholto-Douglas in S r.TLv'CE News Letter for May 26, 1962.

A ROCKET that was fired by the U.S. Air Force eight years ago showed strange phenomena as it rose into the sky at night from Edwards Air Force Base in California. The rocket, released in 1954, showed glowing effects surrounding the rocket as it rose into the darkness. The glowing effects, according to the report, lasted for several minutes and appeared to be emanating from the rocket itself.

The phenomenon was named the "Glenn effect" after Major John H. Glenn, the first American astronaut to orbit the Earth, who helped gather data on the rocket experiments conducted in 1954.

The photogiraphs of the phenomena, which were taken during the rocket firing, were studied by scientists who concluded that the glowing effects were not caused by any known effects of rocket firing. They believe that the strange glowing was produced by the rocket itself in some as yet unexplained manner.

The report indicates that the photographs were carefully examined and the conclusion was reached that the glowing could not be attributed to any known causes connected with the firing of the rocket. There were no wires or other devices attached to the rocket that could have caused the glowing.

The report noted that the phenomenon was repeated in subsequent rocket firings and was observed by many witnesses on the ground. Whatever the cause, the strange glowing effect surrounding the rocket as it rose into the darkness continues to be a mystery.
