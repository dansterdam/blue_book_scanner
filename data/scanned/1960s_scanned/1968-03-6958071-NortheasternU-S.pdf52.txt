However inaccurate I may be, I have taken it upon myself to try to sketch the UFO as I saw it. The part of my sketch that I am the most unsure about is the windows. My "mind's eye" was far too slow to count windows, but I feel safe to estimate that I saw 10 or more. I would not state that these "windows" were exactly square or exactly rectangular, but I think that I saw "squared corners." A possible bulge in the craft's fuselage, the fast speed of the craft and my trying to observe fuselage, shape and color, color of light and make up of trail, leaves me in quite a bit of wonderment about the windows.

Also, I was more interested in looking into these windows than I was in studying window shapes. However, I feel strongly that the windows had definite symmetrical shapes, were clearly outlined as the craft passed by and were lined up in a row horizontally. I feel safe to stress that the windows did not look blurred or fuzzy, but had clear, definite shapes. I observed, also, that the windows looked quite large -- I would say larger than the windows we have in our planes.

Fuselage area was dark here so I didn't notice that "metalic look" here like I did around window area.
