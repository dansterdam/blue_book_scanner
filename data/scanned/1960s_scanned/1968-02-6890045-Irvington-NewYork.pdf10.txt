I can not remember dates or times when I may have seen this object. It base no
recognition in memory as seeing a similar type. I have no recollection of discussing
this in any way.

I was an amateur student a little over a year ago in the physics
of space travel and atomic structure, but never associated any
of this to my present sightings or mention it to anyone. It is
the green flashes that I recall, it might be a 70" meteor as described.
