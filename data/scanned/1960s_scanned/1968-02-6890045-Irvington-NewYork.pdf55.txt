WALLOPS LAUNCHES SIX
EXPERIMENTS OVERNIGHT

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration conducted six chemical cloud experiments between sunset last night and dawn today from its Wallops Island, Va., Station.

Liftoff times were 6:17 p.m., 12:09 a.m., 1:30 a.m., 3:00 a.m., 4:30 a.m., and 6:02 a.m. EST. There were seven launches scheduled in this series. The second launch planned for 10:30 p.m. was cancelled because of payload problems.

Three different chemicals--triethylborane (TEB), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and sodium--were used in this series, to continue the study of short term and seasonal variations in wind structure in the upper atmosphere. Similar tests were conducted at Wallops in January and July 1966, and August 1967.

The dawn firing was a sodium vapor experiment which generated a reddish-orange cloud visible for hundreds of miles.
