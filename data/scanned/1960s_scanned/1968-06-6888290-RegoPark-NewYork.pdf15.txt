Dear Project Blue Book:
I have sighted a U.F.O.! Don't tell anybody about this. I just wanted to run it through my file. Here are the details:
Time: 7:20 to 9:00 - 1:40. 
These were things were seen circling Rego Park, and seemed to be under intelligent control. They changed direction several times. It was a strange sight! There was a halo around each of the objects.
There were at least 10, possibly more.
The night was clear and the moon was bright.
Please let me know if there is any information you can add to this report.
Thanking you in advance.
