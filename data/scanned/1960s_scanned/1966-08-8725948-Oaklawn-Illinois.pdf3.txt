Dear Mr. Blue, The object was above our heads about 3o seconds and then seemed to tilt forward and spin off and away to the south and out of sight. I noticed a small light in the front of it, yellowish in color. The object seemed to stop and hang motionless for a few seconds and then seemed to spit off or throw off small yellow lights and then it took off with great speed and was gone. We were all excited and surprised at what we saw. We have been having a lot of unexplained activity in this area and we wonder what could be going on. I hope you can shed some light on this for us. We would certainly appreciate any information you may have on this matter. Please let us know if you require any additional information from us.
Yours very truly, [Redacted]
