Dear [redacted],

Vice President Humphrey has asked that I reply to your letter regarding the Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) you observed in the vicinity of Zephyrhills, Florida.

Unfortunately, your chances of obtaining an accurate analysis of your observation have been much less than had it immediately reported your observation to the UFO reporting officer at the nearest Air Force base. Responsible officials in Air Force headquarters have not been notified of your letter, and there is no official personnel assigned to the analysis of this case. However, if you will send them a completed, they will correspond with you further.

If your interest in this subject is appreciated. It is a group of officials who have been charged with the analysis of such phenomenon. They hope report will be of further assistance to you, and they will correspond with you as information develops.

Sincerely,
[Signed]
D. N. STEPHENSON
