Ms. "Mom, look at that red thing," and I looked and all of a sudden I saw the red thing and then this car that was in front of me when the red thing came up between the little and the valley there, it, um, the car just nothing. The lights went out and there was no lights or anything anymore.
H Now these were the lights on which car?
L On the other car. 
H On the other car - shushhhhd.
L The headlights and the taillights went out. And I thought, well isn't that a crazy trick to play on me at this time of night, you know.
So then I kind of started to pull over to the right hand side of road so in case he could be then I wouldn't hit him from the back. Well, when this red thing started, it was above this car in the area, and all of a sudden there was no car there.
H I can't hear you now, is somebody on the line?
L Are you there?
H Hello?
L Yes, are you there?
H Well, there but I somebody must have picked up the phone again.
L No, there's no one down now, he's upstairs now.
H Well, I can hear you reasonably well. Go ahead. Can you hear me?
L I can hear you very little, but I can hear you.
H Well, I don't know whether to try this connection again, or not. Maybe I'd better try to get - let's keep on, maybe it'll get better.
L OK - and I started -
H I'll tell"What - why I don't I get the operator and have them call you.
