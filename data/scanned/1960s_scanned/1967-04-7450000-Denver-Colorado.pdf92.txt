The image does not contain any photograph. It is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a questionnaire or form for collecting information about UFO sightings.

Text transcription:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it, if so, how?
Yes. It moved out of sight and changed direction and altitude. 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
Yes. Don't know.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes. Don't know.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Sounded like a jet aircraft
b. Color - Top half was a white glow, bottom half was dark.
c. Size - About the size of a large airplane.
d. Shape - Round.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length, in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match or pencil. If you have performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object do you estimate was covered?
(No response)

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc. and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
(A simple sketch of a round shape with an arrow pointing to the right is provided.)
