Dear
Reference your observation of an unidentified flying object on the night of 12 July 1965. The report which you gave to the AFD duty officer on 12 July 1965 was not sufficient for a full evaluation. The attached FTD Form provided does not contain enough information to make an evaluation. The AFD here provides additional data to supplement your interest in this observation.

Sincerely,
