Dear Sirs:
On the night of 8/1/62 at about 8:30 PM I observed in the sky from my single story porch what appeared to be a formation of 3-4 objects flying at a very high rate of speed. The objects were glowing with a pulsating light and appeared much larger in size than aircraft or satellites I've observed in the sky. The objects were traveling in an apparent east to west direction and seemed to gradually gain altitude or disappear from sight. This happened very rapidly over a period of about 15-20 seconds. Although I did not have the opportunity to take a photograph, the visual observation was quite striking and the objects seemed to defy conventional explanation. I am reporting this sighting to your office in accordance with Air Force regulations. Please let me know if you require any additional information.
