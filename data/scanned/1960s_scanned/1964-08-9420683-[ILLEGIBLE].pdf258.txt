Transcription of the text in the document:

Guy Risian Tells
of W.A.A.F. Sighting
I do not know to what extent the picture itself represents the incident your readers saw, as you do not say. However, the people who saw many such things as
we saw many new homes, lovely
grass and beautiful trees, felt sure
they saw something strange and
clothed with some costume and
apparently being seen for the first time in this area.
This sighting was reported by students, teachers, office girls and government officials. They appear to be typical Americans.
It has been said of the Canadians
citizens, to give preference to
their British masters, they were
seen in paper caps and casual clothes; where in Paper Park, Canada, their leader was seated in a large chair or throne."
A lady was seen waving to them
in a field, then a very friendly
gesture on the part of two Christian women from Pleasant Corners,
Texas, who waved with joy at seeing the space men as they hovered
above their homes were most unexpected."

From the text, it appears this is a report of a UFO sighting, with details about the witnesses (students, teachers, office workers, government officials) and some descriptions of the object and its behavior (hovering above homes, seen by many people). However, there is no photograph or image contained in this particular document page.
