The text in the document is as follows:

26 November 1965

Mr Hunt/an/SAFVOI/PS/24 Nov 65

Dear Mr. Hunt,

This is in reply to your letter regarding aerial objects which you observed on the night of 27 September 1965.

Your letter is similar to many another reports we have received. The light from satellites is caused by reflection from the sun, and the satellites are in orbits, so attempts were made to identify the specific objects observed.

List your information. It is believed the way satellites are illuminated and the orbital data on them would explain the UFO project.

I hope this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

J. Allen Hynek
