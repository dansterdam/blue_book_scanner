There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that contains only handwritten text.

Transcribing the text from the image:

"MARC A STRANGE LIGHT

very star like at first

seems to grow in size
time star

THIS STAR FIRST BECAME VISIBLE ABOUT 7:30 PM AND GRADUALLY INCREASED IN BRIGHTNESS AND ANGULAR SIZE UNTIL IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE MOON AT 8:50 PM. IT THEN GRADUALLY DIMINISHED IN BRIGHTNESS AND SIZE UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED ABOUT 10:00 PM. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED THROUGH A TELESCOPE AND IT APPEARED TO BE ROTATING OR OSCILLATING FROM SIDE TO SIDE A BLUE-GREEN COLOR WAS NOTED DURING THE OBSERVATION.

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HELD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. HOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE TO MEASURE THIS ANGULAR DIAMETER AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE DIAMETER OF THE FULL MOON THE OBJECT SUBTENDED."
