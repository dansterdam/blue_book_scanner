Re: 10/Sept/68, Las Vegas Case
4 Witnesses
Las Vegas, Nev. 89107

It is possible that one person thought one star was moving among others. One would have to ask witness whether she actually saw the object move with respect to the stars.

The moving object was merely a star at a constant rate of speed that when it reached a position directly overhead, forward motion ceased and a pendulum motion was observed.

Furthermore, Nellis Air Force Base personnel also observed the object (supposedly). Also, North Las Vegas Airport observed the object (supposedly) but of course, not established what was observed.

1. Observed motion of object.
2. Its pendulum motion (were other stars also moving like a pendulum?)
3. Evidence of other observers, presumably experienced, at Nellis AFB

Cause of report in my opinion must remain "unidentified" until, if and when, the object disappears from view, I will attempt to do so if authorized. Actually, authorization is implied in Article 1, Paragraph 4(c) to analyze and evaluate reports of unidentified aerial phenomena for the purpose of determining the cause.
