The document is a response letter from Major M. Jacks of the Public Information Division, Office of Information Services, addressing the person who wrote the original letter.

Outputting the text from the document:

Dear Mr. ---

This is in response to your letter of 30 October 1964 addressed to intelligence concerning an unidentified flying object seen in Thailand during the night of 8 June 1962.

This office does not contain a report of an unidentified flying object seen in Thailand during the night of 8 June 1962. There is no knowledge whether or not the unidentified flying object actually occurred and you are referred to the instructions on the reverse side of the AF Form 112. Any aspects of this should be understood that transcription services and not necessarily those of the military services.

If you have any further information regarding this sighting, I would be pleased to receive it and consider it.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKO
Major, USAF
