Mr. ******** states that at no time did he actually agree to the appearance or disappearance of what is described as a sighting of a strange object. He also stated that he wished it had never happened.
On 23 September 1965, the Air Force Office at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station received what the photographic office advised and contacted Mr. **********, the witness, to gain his statement in regard to the sighting.
He stated that following the publication of the two newspaper reports, describing his home calls and the bomb threat, he also received two additional follow-up calls telling him that another report would be sent to him, but he did not receive any additional reports. According to ********, he was told that his statement was requested in order to clarify any doubts the Air Force might have about the matter.
The report states that Mr. ********** was concerned about all of the phone calls for various reasons. Although he *************** had been mentioned in the press release, he was concerned that his name and address had become known. The number involved is limited.
The report goes on to say that two original prints of the photography from the case, along with the photographic negatives, were retained upon the request of the Air Force. The photographic experts, without hesitation, stated that the prints were considered authentic and that no evidence of double exposure or any other attempt to alter the photography was found.
According to the 23 September a man in civilian clothing visited his house, claimed an identification card, and announced he was "Major Andrews" of the Air Force. This individual provided certain details about the sighting that *********** claimed were not accurate. **********'s wife was present during this interview. *********** stated that he requested that the Air Force personnel not tape record their conversation, and they complied.
This report states that to date no other information has been received by the Air Force regarding this matter, and the case is still under investigation.
