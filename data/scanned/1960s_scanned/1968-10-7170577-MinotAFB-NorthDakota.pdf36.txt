"IN THE SKETCH BELOW PLEASE NOTE AT IT IS POSITION OF THE OBSERVER THAT FIRST SEEN, AND A FEW AT THE PERSONS WHOSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO US COULD DESCRIBE THE SCENE, BUT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DO SO WITH COMPLETE ACCURACY BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SIGHTING AND THE LARGE DISPARITY IN THE TIMES AND LOCATIONS FROM WHICH THE SIGHTING WAS OBSERVED. IT IS HOPED THAT THIS SKETCH WILL SERVE TO ILLUSTRATE THE GENERAL NATURE OF THE SIGHTING AS IT WAS REPORTED TO US."
