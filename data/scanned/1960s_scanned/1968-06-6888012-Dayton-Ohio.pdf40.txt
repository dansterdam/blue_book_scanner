UFO Observation, 13 June 1968

Dayton, Ohio 45424

Our investigations indicate that you probably saw a weather balloon that was launched from Wright-Patterson Air Force Station. Ordinarily, they launch the balloons at 6:00 p.m. plus or minus 1 hr. These balloons can be seen for quite some distance depending on the altitude on a clear day. The actual balloon is on top under which is attached a scoop to stabilize the parachute which had at the end the balloon payload is suspended.

Please you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
