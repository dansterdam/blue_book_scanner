C JUNE 66
Shreveport, La.
Dear Major: 
I was under the impression that someone had written to you concerning a sighting which I had reported to the Barksdale Air Force Base on Saturday, June 4, 1966. I am not sure whether or not any report was forwarded and would appreciate it if you could let me know if any record of the report exists.
