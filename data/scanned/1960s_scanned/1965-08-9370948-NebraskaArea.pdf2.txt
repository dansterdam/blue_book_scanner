2. Description of Objects: The reported objects are plotted on the attached map. The descriptions as gathered in subparagraphs below:

a. The objects were observed by civilian witnesses and reported to the United Army troops who assisted in their investigation. The sighting began at about 1535 CST, and the objects were in view for approximately 15 minutes. The size of the objects was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter, and they were observed at an altitude of about 2,000 feet above the ground.

b. The objects were observed from several vantage points and were seen by nine witnesses. See plot number 3.

c. The objects appeared as rotating, glowing objects, whitish in color. The first object was observed to change shape from a circular to a diamond-shaped configuration, and the last object observed had a tail which appeared to follow it behind.

d. The objects moved in a zig-zag pattern at a rapid rate, about 50 degrees per second, and disappeared from view apparently due to the size of the objects and the distance they traveled.

e. One of the objects, which appeared to be the size of a pinhead, seemed to project a beam of light which illuminated the objects under observation. This occurred when the objects were observed through 7x50 binoculars.
