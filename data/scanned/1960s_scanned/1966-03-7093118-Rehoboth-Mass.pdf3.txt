UFO SUMMARY (Rehoboth, Mass. 3/20/66)

SHEET 4

Many UFO sightings being received have occurred in the vicinity of power lines and power stations.

Group # 2
Reported to be a featuring from their position and driving south along Route 18. There were 4 lights gliding along and a bright light in the rear. The lights hovered over the road for a few minutes, darting in various directions. As they moved away, the rear light was observed to make a turn and disappear. The objects were an estimated 4 to 5 hundred yards distance according to the witness.

All witnesses described the UFO as two very large brightly glowing objects. A case indicating the middle of the lane at first gave the impression that 2 cars were approaching. However, the objects were seen to split and one of the lights was observed to make a turn and disappear. Mr. Gordon stated that the two lights were about a half mile apart and were traveling about 500 yards high and maintaining the same relative position to each other. It was estimated that the total viewing time was about 2 to 3 minutes.

Group # 3
Mr. Joseph Mattosa, Postmaster of Rehoboth, was watching TV about 10:30 PM when he glanced out the window to see some strange red lights floating in the sky. He called his wife to the window and they both observed 3 red lights hovering over some trees. The lights moved slowly and silently side-to-side, up and down and appeared to be about 1,000 yards away. They continued observation for about 15 minutes when the lights started to move faster, then disappeared from view. Mr. Mattosa stated that the lights were about the size of a quarter at arm's length and would appear to be the "apparent size of a quarter at arm's length".
