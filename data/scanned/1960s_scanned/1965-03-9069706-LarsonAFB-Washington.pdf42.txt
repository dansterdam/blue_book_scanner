The text describes the investigation by NICAP into an alleged UFO sighting, and states that the AP publicly announced the same, but that the matter is still under investigation.

EVIDENCE CONTRADICTS HOAX CLAIM

According to NICAP's investigation, they received many reports on the alleged hoax of an unidentified flying object seen landing in a nearby woods last September. The witness, who claimed to have taken pictures, later told a reporter the sightings were false. However, NICAP's investigators who checked the site found substantial evidence that the sightings were genuine. The witness later denied making the hoax claim though it had already been published.

The "hoax confession" contains several other discrepancies. For example, the witness stated he had not taken any pictures, though previously he had said he took some. NICAP is investigating further, and new developments will be reported in a later issue.

REEVES STORY

The report of NICAP's investigation into an alleged "ghost light" seen by James C. Reeves of Beaverton, FIa., was reported in the February issue. Through prompt action, NICAP's investigators were able to check the site and interview the witness. After checking through their files, they found the Reeves sighting correlated with several previous reports of a similar phenomenon in the same area, though Reeves had not been aware of these. Two weeks later, the AF publicly announced the same conclusions NICAP had reached privately, that the light was probably a natural occurrence.

The AF states the messages were on file paper, in a simple code. There was no indication of a hoax or fraud.

These cases illustrate how NICAP's investigations frequently turn up evidence supporting the existence of UFOs, often correcting or contradicting the public statements of officials. Where the evidence warrants it, NICAP does not hesitate to question or challenge such statements as the two cases demonstrate.
