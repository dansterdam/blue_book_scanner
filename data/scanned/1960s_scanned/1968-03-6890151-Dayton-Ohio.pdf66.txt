Mr. [redacted] and his friend observed the object on 5 March 1963 while in the car, saw it when they were turning the corner, seemed to be giving a glare, and at first seemed to be standing still over Globe Industries, moved very fast then and out of sighting within two or three seconds. Sees Jets all the time but this wasn't that. Seemed to be bright shiny metal, looked metallic.
