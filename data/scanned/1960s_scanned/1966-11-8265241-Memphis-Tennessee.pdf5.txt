The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

There's a dark shadow like an object in the sky for a few minutes. I could not tell what it was. I looked at it through binoculars for about 5 minutes, until it disappeared. I could not determine its size, shape, or speed. It appeared to be high in the sky, but I could not estimate its altitude. There were no other unusual sights or sounds. That's all I can report on this.

P.S. I do not know anything about UFO's and am not a nut on the subject. I'm just reporting what I saw as requested.
