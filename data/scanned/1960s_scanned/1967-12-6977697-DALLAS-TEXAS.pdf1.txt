11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observers spotted 4 objects in the northern sky that seemed to be clouds. The objects appeared as if they were glowing and surrounded by a glow. The objects seemed to be moving in a southerly direction at altitudes below 20,000 feet. There seems to be no reason why the objects could not have been clouds despite the fact that the observer did not see any other clouds in the sky.
