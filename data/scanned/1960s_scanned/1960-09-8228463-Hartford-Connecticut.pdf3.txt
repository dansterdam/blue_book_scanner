Transcribed text:

The sky was clear at the time and I saw a bright light moving across the sky. I thought at first it was a shooting star, but then I noticed that it was moving too slowly to be a shooting star. It seemed to disappear and reappear at intervals as it moved across the sky. I watched it for several minutes and then it disappeared. I did not hear any sound. It was a clear night but I could not see any shape or outline, only the bright light moving across the sky. I have seen many shooting stars but this light seemed to move in a more controlled manner and was visible for a much longer period of time. I cannot explain what I saw, but it seemed highly unusual and unlike any ordinary astronomical phenomenon I have ever observed.
