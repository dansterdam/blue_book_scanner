UNITED STATES SIGHTINGS...August 5 & 8,1963 VERNON WAYNE CITY & FAIRFIELD, ILLINOIS. This sighting took place the week of Aug 5. UFOs were seen by witnesses the following night too. Attempts replv to our inquiry about his sighting were unsuccessful following an Aug 8th issue of the V/ayne County Press.

A strange object reported as a spherical light, bright as a brilliant star, with a very rapid gyrat-ion, was observed by the witnesses, who called the police at Mt Vernon. They said the object hovered over the scene for a time, then suddenly took off at an estimated speed of 1500 mph, moving straight up into the sky, and disappeared.

Dr. Keyhoe of NICAP at Fairfield and he told them what thev had gotten was something called a tethered balloon but they contend that what they saw was a strange object too.

Witnesses named as in the Aug 8th issue of the Wayne County Press were Harry S. Gorin, Fairfield, 111. 6:7:,59. I believe a circular of a spherical light, bright as a brilliant star, with a very rapid gyration, was observed by the witnesses, who called the police at Mt Vernon. They said the object hovered over the scene for a time, then suddenly took off at an estimated speed of 1500 mph, moving straight up into the sky, and disappeared.

Dayton, Ohio (ATIG) sent three investigators down to the area to interview the witnesses and check the spot but couldn't find anything unusual, and the chief investigator advised that did the others see in the Mt Vernon area, for a few of us at Fairfield did see Jupiter as large as the landing light of an airplane.
