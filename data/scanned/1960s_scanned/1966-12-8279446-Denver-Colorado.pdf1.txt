PROJECT 10673 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 7 Dec 66
2. LOCATION: Denver, Colorado
3. SOURCE: (civilian)
10. CONCLUSION: The object was observed by three witnesses. At the same degrees and at the same azimuth.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Witnesses watched a clear like object larger than perform erratic movements in the eastern part of the sky. The object sides shimmering and appeared to be a solid object. The entire sighting lasted about five to 10 seconds. The object could have been a satellite which did not appear to be a satellite.
The description is consistent with that of an astroobject which would have been fairly low on the horizon and would have been the brightest object in the sky.
