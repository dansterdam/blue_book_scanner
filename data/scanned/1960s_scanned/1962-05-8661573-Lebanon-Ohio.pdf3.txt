Transcribed text from the document:

Gentlemen:
About 9:45 P.M. on Saturday, one 1/2 hour later, a rather brilliant light passed over at a considerable distance to the west going in a northerly direction. At first we thought it was a plane or satellites but it was much too slow and bright. It passed out of sight in a northerly direction. This was just as it was getting dark that evening. My wife and I were sitting on the porch and it was very plain and distinct. There was no sound and it moved in a straight line at a steady pace. I have seen many unusual things in the skies over this area, but this was the brightest and most distinct I have ever seen.
Very truly yours,
