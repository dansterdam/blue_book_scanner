The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document describing a test of the Apollo moonlight escape system that was postponed due to gusty winds and a desert sandstorm. The text outlines details of the planned test, including the expected altitude of the "Little Joe" rocket, the function of the destruct signal, and the role of the command module in carrying the astronaut-pilots.

WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. MAY 13/CAP/-A SECOND ATTEMPT WILL BE MADE TODAY TO FIRE A LITTLE JOE II ROCKET IN A TEST OF THE APOLLO MOONLIGHT ESCAPE SYSTEM. 
THE SHOT WAS POSTPONED YESTERDAY BECAUSE OF GUSTY WINDS AND A DESERT SANDSTORM.
THE LITTLE JOE IS EXPECTED TO HURL THE SIMULATED APOLLO SPACECRAFT TO 22,000 FEET AT 6 A.M. (MST).
A DESTRUCT SIGNAL WILL DESTROY THE MISSILE AND FIRE THE ESCAPE SYSTEM. IT WILL SEPARATE THE COMMAND MODULE AND PROPEL IT A SAFE DISTANCE WHERE FOUR PARACHUTES WILL BE DEPLOYED TO LOWER THE CRAFT TO EARTH.
THE COMMAND MODULE IS THE NERVE CENTER FOR THE APOLLO AND WILL CARRY THE ASTRONAUT-PILOTS.
