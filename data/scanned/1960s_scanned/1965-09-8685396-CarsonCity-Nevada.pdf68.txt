The image does not contain any photograph. It is a page from an old UFO report document that appears to describe a "Gassisson cylinder". The text describes the details of this object, including its physical characteristics and reported observations. As an OCR system, I will now output the full text contained in the document:

Gassisson cylinder
The main object appears to be a long cylinder, about 40 feet in length and 12 feet in diameter, which is reported to have been observed on the ground near Carson City, Nevada, on 22 Sep 65. The object is described as having a smooth metallic surface and was said to give off a faint hum. It apparently landed gently and was able to take off vertically, leaving no disturbance of the ground. The object was observed by several people, including a Dr. C. H. Dirvin of Glendale, California, who was able to make a close approach to the object. The observations indicate this was a structured craft of some sort, but its purpose and origin remain unknown. No information is provided about the peculiar name 'Gassisson' applied to this object.
