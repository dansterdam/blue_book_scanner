The image contains several illustrations but no photographs. The first illustration appears to be a curved line diagram showing the height of an object above the horizon. The second illustration shows a larger sketch of the object's position when it was first seen, and a smaller sketch of how the object's size changed over time.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it, to enable a smaller sketch to complete the larger sketch.
