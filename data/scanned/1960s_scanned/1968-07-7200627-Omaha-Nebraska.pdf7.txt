SUBJECT: UFO Sighting of 11 July 1963

TO: PID (ATDT-Lt Morano)

1. No known aircraft were flying in the area at the time of the sighting according to the local airport controller. Runway lights and control tower appeared normal. At approximately 10:30, by landing on runway 15 this would mean that the aircraft was still approximately 15 miles southwest of the sighting location. There were no airborne aircraft in the vicinity during this time frame.
2. There are only two reports in the vicinity of the sighting. Milliken Air Field had no knowledge of any aircraft, nor did the Lincoln Control Center.
3. I visited the alleged sighting and no one there had seen or heard of anything unusual. There are no reports of the same or similar "lights" from any other source. All persons interviewed were normal and none showed evidence of being affected or disturbed by the usual bright light aircraft style, both high wing and low wing type, illumination.
4. I contacted the Omaha Radar Approach Control facility and there were no unidentified targets on their scopes at the time specified.
