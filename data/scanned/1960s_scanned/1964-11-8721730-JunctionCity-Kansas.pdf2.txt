Dear sir:

My friend and I have been seeing strange lights in the sky. We think they are spacecraft from another planet. We don't know what to make of it. When we try to investigate, they go dark and disappear. We would like to report this experience to someone who could tell us more.

We saw the lights on November 4 at about 12-14 p.m. They were very bright and were moving in the sky in a zigzag pattern. They seemed to be controlled from somewhere. At one point they stopped and hovered for a few minutes. Then they took off at a very high speed.
