NO. CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)      25 JULY 1965

Dear Dr. Hynek,

I would like to report the sighting of a UFO on the night of July 19 at 9:55 p.m. to 10:30 approximately. There was a small white light that my wife and I were lying on a rock ledge listening to a baseball game on the radio, when I was looking towards the sky. I noticed an object moving slowly, thinking this was an old radio satellite. As we continued to watch, it changed its pace "look, there's an echo satellite!" I first noticed it as it headed east, the second star on the handle of the dipper and the third star. As we're surrounded by low mountains, the big dipper was low in the northern horizon.

As we traced its path along the stars keeping a paralell or perpalicular to the stars or constellations, we noticed that it changed its path twice. First, towards the southwest and then just at about five seconds before continuing. As it went twenty degrees (approximately) from the horizon, it stopped. At this time we could see it change colors from a bright green to a reddish-orange beacon at an airport but sometimes slow and sometimes fast.
