The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, which seems to be a questionnaire or form for the observer to provide information about their sighting.

Text output:

31. Date you completed this questionnaire:         Day       Month       Year

33. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
