Place a "Y" at the same curve to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Then draw a line from the "X" to the "Y" to show the path the object took as you watched it pass.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Indicate the number and give a picture of how they were arranged, and give an estimate of their speed and direction they were traveling.
