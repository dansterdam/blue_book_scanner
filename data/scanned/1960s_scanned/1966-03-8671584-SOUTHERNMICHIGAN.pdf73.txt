Text from the document:

Theoretically, they are treated to the look to win, and immediate access. Light and colour in the open sky, by mankind and chemical. By Sienko and Plank. If there the lights are described even into their colors red, yellow, white and green thus making the colors described by the elements of the distance. It is stated that in those looks the illuminant, is a form of low temperature chemical luminescence which does not char or burn grass, etc. The lights general are evanescent, burning there for a moment or so going out, and appearing some feet or yards as another plume of gas spontaneously ignites. This sporadic lighting is generally soundless although sometimes a rumpling noise is heard (this may be the origin of the "riotous sound" Mr. Hangar recorded). The illusion of motion can easily be carried by the sporadic appearance of of a pulse of light here and there. The lights have never been described as their original. They would be visible heat or a clear motion of air which deduced by a glass of water placed by later would quick disappear as the gas as it bubbled up from underneath.

It appears to me that all the major conditions for the appearance of swamp lights were satisfied both at Dafter and Hillsdale. I can't state with an certainty that this is the correct solution to the problem, except that it is the most likely natural cause. I would be very appreciate learning of any other possible natural causes should they be forthcoming. We can, I believe, completely eliminate an solution based on balloons, lights, meteors, stars, etc. because they simply do not fit the consistent data reported to me.
