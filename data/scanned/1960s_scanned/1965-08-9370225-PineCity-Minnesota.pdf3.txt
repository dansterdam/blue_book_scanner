The image contains a hand-drawn sketch that appears to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The sketch depicts a compass with directional markings and an illustration of an unidentified object moving in the sky. There is also text describing the motion and behavior of the observed object, including that it hovered for long periods and had erratic movement.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show the change in direction during the course.
