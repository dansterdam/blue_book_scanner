STATEMENT

CAPT KATO: My name is Captain Kato and I'm performing a interview with Deputy Sheriff Powell.

On the night of March 5th, on this night going to work, I was observed some an object in the sky, first brought to my attention by the unusual lights, the arrangement of the lights. The lights appeared to be red and green lights, and a center light, this object had a white light which I thought was the rear, with a red light which I felt was on the left. This object was moving in a east to west direction however, it would stop and hover for a period of a few seconds. At times there would be a few seconds of standby, this light would come on so bright that it would be impossible to look at it, and would move off, and then it would reappear in another place. And I felt that something was unusual about it, because it did not exhibit anything I had observed in other aircraft observing continually watching this object as it moved in a westerly direction. As I searched Cambridge, it seemed that the object started a southerly course and was heading away. I would estimate the distance from me to be somewhere in the neighborhood of a slight miles. The object was low on the horizon and I would estimate this to be approximately a thousand to fifteen hundred feet. My experience as a pilot has been a private license, and I am not licensed at the present however, I have had quite a number of hours in the air as a private pilot.
