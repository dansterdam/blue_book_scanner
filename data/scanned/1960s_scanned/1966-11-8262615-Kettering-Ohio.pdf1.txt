11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a very bright orange-red object in the eastern part of the sky in addition to the star which was moving at a fast rate, descending and ascending in the sky, finally disappearing. The object was observed for approximately 3 hours, but due to the lack of definite data, the evaluation is inconclusive. Without more definite data, its nature and origin could not be determined.
