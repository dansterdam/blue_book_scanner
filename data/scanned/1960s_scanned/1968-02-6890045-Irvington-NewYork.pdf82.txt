There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a page from a UFO report document containing a questionnaire or form.

Here is the text I was able to extract from the document:

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object, before. If so, when and where?
31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? Circle One: Yes No
31.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too? Circle One: Yes No
31.2 Please list their names and addresses.
32. Please give the following information about yourself.
NAME:
ADDRESS:
TELEPHONE NUMBER: 
AGE: 53 SEX: Female
Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent.
For years I have had an intense experience with unknown flying objects. I see them quite often; they appear to come every 3-4 years in increasing numbers. At times I am afraid they may be watching me, but usually I enjoy their presence as I feel they are benign. They always travel silently and swiftly, sometimes singly, sometimes in groups of 3-5. They never remain in view for more than a minute or two. I have never been physically ill, and they have never done anything to harm me. I am a deep thinker and love to discuss these matters with others who are interested.
33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
