The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document discussing UFO sightings and reports.

The text in the document is as follows:

"phenomenon which remains unexplained long enough for someone to write a report about it." It is the problem of the serious investigator to probe for the stimuli that give rise to the reports.

The U. S. Air Force investigators have long accepted the fact that most of the originators of UFO reports are sincere people, interested in the welfare and security of the country, and that they are honestly puzzled by the sightings that they report. Their frequent readiness to ascribe a UFO to extraterrestrial sources, their emotional attachment to this explanation, and their reluctance to take into account the failure of the continuous and extensive surveillance of the sky by trained observers, both military and civilian (such as the professional and volunteer (Moonwatch) artificial satellite observers), to produce UFO sightings is surprising. It hardly appears credible that spacecraft should frequently announce themselves readily to casual observers and craftily avoid detection by the constant professional military and civilian surveillance of the sky.

Nonetheless, it must be recognized that our knowledge of the universe and its contents, and of the physics of our atmosphere, is still imperfect, and that there may be "more things in Heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy." UFO sightings, so long as they continue, deserve serious study, and may lead to not only advances in physical knowledge, but in the area of human behavior as well.
