Proposed reply to letter from [redacted] postmarked June 22, 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your recent correspondence in which you reported sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in your area.

If the individuals wish to report their observations directly to the Air Force, they should contact the nearest Air Force Installation, which is Andrews AFB, Maryland.

Each Air Force base has a UFO investigator who gathers all pertinent information on the particular sighting. If he is unable to determine the stimulus, the information is sent to Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for their evaluation and further investigation.

Your information will be filed for information purposes.
