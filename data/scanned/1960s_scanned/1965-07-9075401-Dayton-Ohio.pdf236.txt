The image contains a sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch shows the relative positions of an object above the horizon at different time intervals, with instructions for the observer to indicate the altitude of the object and the time it was observed.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "x" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "90" on the compass where you first saw the object.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place a "X" at the start of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
