The text in the letter is as follows:

October 29, 1963

Dear Mr. ____,

"Reference is made to the report entitled "Observations and Discoveries" which you recently sent to the Air Force."

Your reference to the passage of ECHO is noted. The ECHO satellite passed over the Pacific September 9-30, 1963.

The book "Light and Color" by A.E. Minnaert is recommended for information regarding the discoloration or optical phenomena associated with the dissociation of ECHO's flight path.

Sincerely,
MASON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information

Mr. ____
