AUG 10 1952

Dear Mr. 

This is in reply to your recent communication in behalf 
of his on April 15, 1952.

The same noted by him was thoroughly investigated 
by the Air Force because of the unusual amount of 
publicity given to the event and the conflicting 
circumstances indicated in the case.

Detailed studies of the depositions have led to the 
conclusion that the sighting reported last April 15 
represents an unexplained aerial phenomenon and 
detailed analysis indicates the probable reaction to be 
a viritual hoax or intentional fabrication done in the Eureka, 
Utah, Rocky Mountain area.

Our continued studies of the depositions do not warrant 
further assistance on the sighting to you or the individual 
concerned.

Sincerely,
