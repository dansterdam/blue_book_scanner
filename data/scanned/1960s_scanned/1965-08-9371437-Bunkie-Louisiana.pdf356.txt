Gentlemen:

I am sending you a report, correspondence and two pictures sent to Griffith Observatory for evaluation. We are not able to identify the objects seen on August 22, 1965. Most of these reports on U.F.O.'s we handle here but this one must be a 1-F-100.

We request that you send the material and photographs back to us as soon as you can return them. We will appreciate a report on your investigation.

Sincerely,
Dean Swift,
Associate Director
