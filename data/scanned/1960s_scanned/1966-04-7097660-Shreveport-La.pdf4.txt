ELWOOD, N.J.

As the witness stated, those objects were saucer shaped and seemed to be guided. There were three of them flying in trail formation. The objects were apparently under intelligent control and appeared to be metallic in construction. The color was silver and the surface was reflective. They made no sound and were observed for approximately 3 minutes. The objects were heading in a north easterly direction at a low level and then accelerated and climbed rapidly out of sight. The witness was quite certain of his observation and is a reliable and trustworthy observer.
