UFO report

This is a report on a phone call to -- and to -- of their sighting of 5 Aug 65: 2 August may be significant because it is the time when many sightings were going on, but these boys were not out looking for UFOs. They were out with a telescope, shortly after midnight and were lying on the ground looking straight up. All of a sudden there popped into slow, "like a lightening bug would" according to --, and moved southwest some 20 per second according to Larry and some 40 per second according to --, the latter being based on a memory test over the telephone. According to -- it turned south (according to his report) and north, according to his drawing. He reports a turn of 45° which he changed to 10° on phone, and did not mention any turn in particular, except a zigging motion. Its color was white, like a star, (as the major portion of its journey, turning to a fainter red later on.

The direction was opposite to that of satellites, and satellites don't turn red. The pulsing matter is its sudden appearance, which both boys agreed upon independently. There was no sound heard.

Referring to the angular rate chart, we see that

There is still the possibility that it could have been a meteor and that the boys have over-estimated the time. They reported no trail whatever, whereas another possibility is that of an airplane suddenly turning its landing lights on - wrong direction for O'Hare - but it might have been in the landing pattern. But why should it suddenly change to red in 10 seconds and then go out very shortly thereafter? It disappeared suddenly - it did not fade out with distance. The boys both reported a completely clear sky although there were some clouds later on, and had been some earlier.
