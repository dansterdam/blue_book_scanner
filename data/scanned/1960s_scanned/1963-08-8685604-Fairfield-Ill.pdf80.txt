"Morning star" chases car
The following account of a "morning star" chasing an automobile was written by Mr. Wilbur H. Atwater of Fairfield, 111., following an encounter with the unusual phenomenon. 
On the night of August 8, 1963, at approximately 12:30 A.M. (midnight), a bright light, brighter than any star I have ever seen, was observed chasing an automobile approximately 10 to 15 miles an hour early yesterday, traveling in a southeasterly direction. The light seemed to be about 200 to 300 feet behind the car, and was traveling at a terrific rate of speed, estimated to be around 1,500 to 2,000 miles an hour. 
The automobile was traveling from Mount Vernon, Illinois, to Fairfield, Illinois, a distance of approximately 40 miles. The light followed the car for several miles, and then suddenly disappeared. 
The man claimed the light seemed to have a "crackling sound" and had a "cone-shaped" appearance. He also reported that the light seemed to be "guided" and not just a random phenomenon. The light was observed for approximately 15 to 20 minutes and passed overhead at a very high altitude.
