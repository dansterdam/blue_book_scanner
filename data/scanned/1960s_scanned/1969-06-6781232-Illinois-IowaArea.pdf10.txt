The text from the document is as follows:

"Approx. 41:52 a.m. When sighted object was gradually moving on a northerly course and was stationary and glowing at a spot for several seconds and then accelerated and moved off rapidly and disappeared completely from view. This object did not make a noise and was silent through the complete observation on the sighting. The object came to a dead stop and hovered motionless for several seconds and then accelerated at a high rate of speed and moved off rapidly and disappeared completely from view. The object was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter and was a brilliant white color and appeared extremely bright. It was moving at a high rate of speed and then would stop and hover motionless for several seconds at a time before accelerating and moving off again. I would estimate the total time of the observation to be around 3 minutes. The object made no sound whatever during the complete observation."
