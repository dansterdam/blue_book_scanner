TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
ON OR ABOUT 2145 HOURS ON THE 5TH OF SEPT, 1966, HE WAS ASKED TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT AN OBJECT THAT APPEARED IN THE WEST THAT FIRST THOUGHT TO BE A STAR. HE SAID THAT AFTER HE LOOKED AT IT HE SOON REALIZED THAT IT WAS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. HE NOTICED THAT IT SEEMED TO BE CHANGING SHAPE FREQUENTLY AND MANEUVERING INDEPENDENTLY AT ABOUT 1500 TO 2000 FEET. HE STATED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE SHAPED LIKE A DISC OF SOME SORT AND HAD VARYING SHADES OF GREEN LIGHTS AROUND THE EDGE. IT ALSO HAD SOME SORT OF BULGE IN THE CENTER. HE SAID THAT AFTER HE CALLED THE OTHERS AND THEY WERE WATCHING IT THROUGH BINOCULARS, THE OBJECT SUDDENLY STARTED MOVING VERY FAST TOWARD THE NORTH AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT WITHIN A FEW SECONDS. HE SAID THAT THE OBJECT GAVE HIM THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL. HE ASKED THEM IF THEY COULD SEE IT VISUALLY, AND THEY SAID THEY COULD. THE INITIAL CONTACT WAS APPROXIMATELY 2145 HOURS. LATER ON, AFTER THE OBJECT HAD MANEUVERED AND DISAPPEARED, THEY CONTINUED TO WATCH THE AREA FOR SOME THIRTY MINUTES OR MORE BUT NOTHING ELSE COULD BE OBSERVED. THE OBJECT MOVED WEST AND VISUAL CONTACT WAS LOST COMPLETELY WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES.
