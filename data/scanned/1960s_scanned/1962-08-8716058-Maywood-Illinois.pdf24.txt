The text in the document reads:
"A person named Talmero A. Tencel, 40, who worked in Veracruz, Argentina, gave the following information: 
According to him, the following incident occurred: One night, at about 22.45 hrs, Tencel along with his brother-in-law and sister-in-law, were driving on a country road near Maywood, Argentina when they saw an object surrounded by a classic luminous halo which they estimated to be about 25 meters in diameter. This object paced their car for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared. Tencel said he is certain that this was not a normal aircraft as they were accustomed to seeing, and he believes it was some sort of unidentified flying object. He said the object made no noise and its light was an intense white. He also said he felt nervous as a result of the incident, and had not intended to make it known."
