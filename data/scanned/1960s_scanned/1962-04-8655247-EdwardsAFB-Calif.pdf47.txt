The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that discusses "Space Changes Heredity" and "Explore Solar Flares".

The text in the document is as follows:

Space Changes Heredity
Changes in heredity of organisms may be induced through cosmic radiation, electrical and magnetic fields, and other environmental factors associated with space flight. These changes could have profound effects upon the earth's ecology and human race.

Explore Solar Flares
A space shutter photograph of a large solar flare which occurred on June 8, 1962 has been obtained. This flare was among the most intense ever observed. Such flares can have significant effects on communications and electric power systems on earth. Flares also produce intense radiation which can be hazardous to astronauts.

The 1 July 1962 earthquake centered off the Pacific coast of southern Mexico was one of the largest in that region in 5 years. It caused extensive damage and loss of life.
