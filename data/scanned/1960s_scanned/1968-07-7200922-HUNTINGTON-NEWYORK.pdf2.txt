Text extracted from the document:

"SAF-OICC/Miss Turnure/T6326/August 1, 1968

Dear
Your letter of July 22, 1969, addressed to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in which you described a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO), has been referred to this office for reply.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the incident described in your letter. We require that people who report UFO sightings complete a questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope. Your request for more details will be investigated further and an evaluation made.

Should you ever sight an object, please report it promptly to the nearest Air Force base. Each case is screened through the official Air Force channels and subjected to a technical analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the object yourself by looking at the categories of objects often included in the Project Blue Book. Some of these are included.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division"
