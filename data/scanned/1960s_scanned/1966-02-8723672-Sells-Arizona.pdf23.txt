The memo describes the conversation, including that the observers admitted it was Venus but couldn't understand why it was so unusually red and bright. The memo also mentions that Major Burkholder wanted to ensure no unexplained activity was related to the observation, and that after checking, Venus was determined to be -4.3 stellar magnitude, the brightest it gets all year but starting to decline in brightness.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD: CALL FROM MAJ BURKHOLDER, 4 MAR 66, 0950.

Maj Burkholder from Pentagon called at 0950, 4 Mar 66 regarding report of Venus observation from Arizona on 28 Feb 66. Wanted to know if it was possible that the Soviet probe that was going nearby or passing at that time would have caused Venus to appear unusual. The observers admitted that it was Venus but couldn't understand why it was so unusually red and bright. Major Burkholder wanted us to make sure that no unexplained activity might be related to the observation.

After checking it was found that Venus was -4.3 stellar mag. The brightest it will get all year, and at present it is starting to decline in brightness.

Maj Burkholder may be reached at 5x 59702 Pentagon, if no answer 54547.

At 0910 Ann Elmer explained to Maj Burkholder how bright Venus was, etc. Maj Burkholder was quite satisfied.
