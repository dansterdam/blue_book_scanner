U.S. SPACE TEAM COULD BLAST OFF FOR MARS IN 1975, SCIENTIST SAYS

- A NASA-run three-man U.S. space team could be successfully landed on Mars in 1975, according to Dr. Wernher von Braun, director of the Marshall Space Flight Division of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, and director of the Saturn program.

- The target date could be as early as 1975 - if government officials give the project the go-ahead at this time, he said.

- Von Braun said the landing would provide much of the testing and assembling the hardware and three-year training program needed to land men safely on Mars.

- Dr. Dixon said the only additional work needed beyond current space studies would be the final development of a larger propellant spacecraft, a mother ship from an earth-orbiting space station and atmospheric conditions. 

- The major hurdle is to have the government want to make the trip.

- The Russians say they expect to make the round trip.

- The mother-ship would establish a Martian orbit and send out the actual landing vehicle.

- The flight would last about one hour.

- The capsule or craft described would be able to change directions to make corrections from the prime launch pattern. It would be a small craft and not the large one used for the blast-off.

- Most of the equipment in the landing craft would be expendable once it has served its specific purpose, Dr. Dixon said.
