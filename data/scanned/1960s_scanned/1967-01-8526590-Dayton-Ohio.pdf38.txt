The image in this document does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed text describing and analyzing a purported UFO image.

UFO - 40 # 68-74
An examination of both the dupe negative and the positive revealed no evidence of physical or optical tampering. The image in question is quite indistinct and without detail whatsoever.
An untold number of explanations could be offered, none of which could be proven or disproved. The 15 of the 173 objects in the picture are not clearly defined as to shape, size, or distance. The data is vague and meaningless.
The image does not appear to be a printing, processing, or film defect. The most reasonable explanation, considering all the factors and statements in the report, is that the object is affected by some kind of reflection off of or within or near the optical system. The possibility exists, but is quite remote (due to the erratic motion of the image) that it could be the image of a reflection of an extremely high surface that is off of the optical system.
