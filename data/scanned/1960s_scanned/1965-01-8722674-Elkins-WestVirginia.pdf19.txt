TO: Hq USAF (AFSWD)  
WASH DC 20330

This is in response to a UFO report from an observer in Elkins, West Virginia on 22 January 1965 under the above subject. The report indicated that the observer took pictures of an object which he described as a white light with a blinking red light. He stated that the object hovered for about 45 minutes.

A preliminary evaluation indicates the possibility of the object being a satellite. The reflecting light from the sun, coupled with the blinking red light, could account for the description given. Your analysis and evaluation of this sighting will be appreciated.
