BLACK OBJEcT SEEMED 'ON FIRE'

SOUTH HILL, Va. (AP) - Fire chief Corbin Hendrick said he saw a big flaming object like a burning airplane passing overhead Monday night and found a burned spot on the ground where it appeared to have touched down. 

"It was just a flash and it was gone. But it seemed to be on fire as it passed over," said Hendrick, who was in charge of South Hill's volunteer fire department.

Hendrick said he ran outside his home and watched the object, which he said was about the size of a small automobile, pass overhead at about 200 feet. He said it appeared to be a black object that "seemed to be on fire."

After the object disappeared, Hendrick said he and other firemen searched the area and found a burned spot about 10 feet across on a road near South Hill. They said the spot appeared to have been made by intense heat.

State police were called and arrived at the scene shortly after, the article states. The article also mentions that an Air Force investigator was dispatched to look into the incident.
