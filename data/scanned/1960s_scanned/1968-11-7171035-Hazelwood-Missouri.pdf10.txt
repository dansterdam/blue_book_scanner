The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is a form with questions about various UFO phenomena, such as the object's movement, appearance, and disappearance. The form also includes a section for the observer to describe what drew their attention to the phenomenon.

Here is the transcription of the text found in the document:

HAVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
CHANGE DIRECTION AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
IF UNDER OR POSSIBLE?
