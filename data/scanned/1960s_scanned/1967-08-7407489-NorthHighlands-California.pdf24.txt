"My thirteen year old daughter was in the front yard and saw a very bright light in the sky. It was stationary and seemed to be hovering. The object was oblong in shape, rather large, and appeared to be approximately 30 inches across the horizon. The brightest part of the object was in the center. Rays or beams of light were emanating in various directions from the center. These rays changed in color from orange to reddish orange to red. The rays seemed to illuminate the ground and the object. After a few minutes, the object suddenly took off at a tremendous rate of speed, disappearing in the distance. The entire sighting lasted approximately 4 minutes. My daughter was completely unnerved by the experience and came running into the house very upset. I rushed outside to see if I could observe the object but it had already left the area. We did not hear any sound from the object as it hovered or as it took off. The only sound was the crying of my daughter. The time of the sighting was around 10:00 pm. As I said, the object was stationary and seemed to be hovering for some time before it suddenly accelerated out of sight at a tremendous rate of speed. That is the extent of the information I can provide. I hope this will be useful to your investigation. Please let me know if you need any additional details."
