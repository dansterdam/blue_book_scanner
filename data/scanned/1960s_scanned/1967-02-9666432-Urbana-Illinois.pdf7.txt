"STATEMENT

University of Illinois, age 20.

"I left the auditorium around 2:00 hours on 25 February and was proceeding to the Union. As I was crossing the quad, I suddenly looked up and saw a strange white object in the sky. It was flying west and appeared to be blinking. After watching it for a few minutes, it suddenly went out of sight about 1500 hours above the Illini Towers and that it was stationary."
