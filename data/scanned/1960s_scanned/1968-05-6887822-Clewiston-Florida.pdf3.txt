Dear Sir:
We saw on the night of May the 13, 1968 about 10 o'clock 7 U.F.O.'s come off at a high rate of speed. They were seen. It was about 10:50 and they were seen, but 12 minutes apart. About 7 good ones were seen. It was coming at a high rate of speed, but 12 minutes apart. The formations, the lights, and the maneuvers were unusual. Colored and strange vehicle. They objects were seen through good telescope. All of the objects were teaping the whole observation, but for some unknown reason the tape was ruined. After this experience we decided to start a club so we can keep a watch for U.F.O. so we would like some advice from you.

Sincerely Yours
P.S. The witnesses were:
