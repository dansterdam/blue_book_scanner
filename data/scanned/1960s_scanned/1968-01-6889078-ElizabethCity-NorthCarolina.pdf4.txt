Transcription of the text in the document:

Both of them appeared to be moving toward the North east up, another one was going about 1 miles above the ground and headed from East to West. Some kind of upper Big Dipper or Ursa major. Observe about 30 minutes and about 1/2 of my brothers have seen the same thing and stay there I would say that the length of time that I saw this, on a summer nite, July 29, 1966, my cousin and my uncle, they this thing, they observed the light was about as a complete around the size of the sighting. About 100 yards across a field, it was.
