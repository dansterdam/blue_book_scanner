CAN YOU IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN IT WAS FIRST SEEN, AND A MAP OF THE HORIZON AS IT APPEARED TO YOU AT THAT TIME. DRAW A SKETCH THAT WOULD INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE FIRST SIGHTING AND THE RELATIVE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B" THAT IS SCHEMATICALLY SHOWN IN THIS DIAGRAM. REFER TO SIMILAR SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO DIAGRAM YOUR OBSERVATION.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION WHEN LAST OBSERVED. DRAW AN ARROW TO INDICATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THIS IS SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHAT THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B" THAT IS SCHEMATICALLY SHOWN IN THIS DIAGRAM.
