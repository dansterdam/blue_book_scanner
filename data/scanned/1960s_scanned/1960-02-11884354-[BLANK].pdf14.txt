Project Blue Book (Unidentified Flying Objects)

HQ USAF
ATCIN-4 DC 
On 6 April 1962 ATIC participated in a briefing on the USAF unidentified flying objects program which was given to Dr. Robertson's committee for Public Relations to the Secretary of the Air Force. This briefing was requested by the Department of Public Relations and concerned recent investigations between ATIC and the Robertson Committee. During the briefing Mr. Trapnell was informed of the history of the program, the Air Force's role in current investigations, and the major problems involved. This briefing was done at the request of the Robertson Committee. It was considered that any evidence which would change the conclusion of the Robertson Committee should be presented.
a. ATIC pointed out that this is a major step toward accepting many associations with any unsolved case as substantiated. This was out of place with the Air Force, and indicated that he intends to take the investigations of the Air Force with a view to the public.
b. A transfer of the UFO project to another agency such as NASA, NSP or Smithsonian Institutions and have conducted as a program to study the atmospheric physics.
c. Discontinuance of project from any association with intelligence and hire a contractor to conduct the program under Air Force monitoring.
d. Contract a private organization to study the material which has been accumulated to date and recommend a course of action. This recommendation could be comparable if the Air Force programme was adequate and the present position was unacceptable.
