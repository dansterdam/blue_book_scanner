The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing the observer's personal account and views on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that they and their family or neighbors have reportedly witnessed.

Objects. This includes my father and mother; my best friend and my neighbors - the daughter and me.

Everyone will swear that they saw the objects.

My Personal Views.
I would like to express my personal views on the U.F.O.'s we saw. We have many books on U.F.O.'s. When we spotted the objects, we looked at these books plus the sab., 1956 closed file, and we have come to certain definite conclusions on the above subject.

My family + my neighbors have decided it was an airplane; no. satellite, and no balloon.

Please, in a return letter express your views about the U.F.O.'s that we spotted.
