31. 10 July 1967. Azalea, Mississippi:
See attached supplemental report B.

32. 11 July 1967. Macon, Georgia:
Temporarily misplaced. Check to see whether this has any relation to the sighting the previous day in Azalea, Mississippi.

33. 25 July 1967. Manchester, New Hampshire:
The only Manchester, New Hampshire case I have is for a different date.

34. 12 October 1967. Ocaloosa County, Florida: 
Although this had been witnessed, the data are very poor. A balloon is said to be seen but because of winds at altitude, one tracking the other, higher flights, etc., anyone of three evaluations: (1) insufficient data (2) probable aircraft (3) possible unknown.

35. 31 October 1967. Denver, Colorado:
Do not have in my files. Will do in Dayton.
