WHAT WAS THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON IN RELATION TO THE FOLLOWING FAMILIAR OBJECTS?

GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHAT IT APPEARED TO DO, IF IT CHANGED SHAPE, COLOR, BRIGHTNESS, SPEED, OR DIRECTION, AND HOW LONG IT WAS VISIBLE.
All I can say is because of the nature of the object I was observing I hesitate to draw a picture because it would be difficult to reproduce the apparent changing, almost random nature of this object. It seemed to change size and shape in a rather erratic manner and would appear to blink on and off. I had the impression that it was an intelligently guided craft, but its maneuverability and apparent size changes seemed to defy explanation. It was visible for about 10 to 15 minutes as I could observe it before it went behind some trees and I lost sight of it. There was no sound that I could detect during the sighting. I will add that I have had some training and background in observing astronomical and meteorological phenomena, and this object did not conform to anything I have ever seen before in that area. I would say that this was a very unusual and puzzling experience for me.
