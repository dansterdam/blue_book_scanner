1. Reference your letter of 30 August 1968, subject as above.

2. There was a launch from Cape Kennedy at the time the aerial phenomena was observed. It was the first Poseidon launch, and appeared very much as it was sighted from Craig AFB. At the altitude at which the phenomena occurred the Project Office advises that a 600 M horizon is reasonable. The time of the sighting would have had to be several minutes before the time you established the sighting, however.
