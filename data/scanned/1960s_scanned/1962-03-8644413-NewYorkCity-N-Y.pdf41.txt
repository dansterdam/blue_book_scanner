NO. CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

18 Mar 62
SANAN base, antarctic

Other UAQ Sightings in Antarctice

This report is from the SANAN base: According to information in the "Antarctic", published by the New Zealand Antarctic Society, informed this Headquarters that a very bright luminous object had been sighted north of that station which was proceeding to north at a small elevation over the horizon, remaining in sight for only 15 seconds.

In the same number of the publication listed above, there is a record of observation made by a meteorologist at Hallett base, who observed an object which is described as luminous and round, crossing from west to east at a very rapid rate. This object is reported to be controlled by USAF and New Zealand authorities on the opposite side of the SANAN base (through the South Pole), according to a telephone message from the base commander at Hallett, made at 11:10 GMT on 7 March 1962, crossing in 3 to 4 minutes. The object showed three different parts sharply separated, one of long endurance, having the shape of a sphere, and the other two of short duration.
