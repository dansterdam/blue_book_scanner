Dear Dr.:
The enclosed clipping may be of interest to you. I was so impressed with the local controversy over this sighting that I decided to send you a report of the details as I was able to obtain them.
On the evening of July 12, 1964, several residents of this area reported seeing a strange object in the sky. It was described as a luminous, disc-shaped object which hovered and maneuvered for about 20 minutes. One witness, a well-respected businessman, claims to have observed the object through binoculars and seen "portholes" on its surface.
There was considerable excitement in the community over this sighting, and a number of people went out in the hope of seeing the object. However, by the time they arrived at the observation point, the object had disappeared.
I feel that this sighting, being so close to your home community, may be of special interest to you. If you would care to pursue this matter further, I would be happy to provide you with additional details.
Truly sincerely yours,
