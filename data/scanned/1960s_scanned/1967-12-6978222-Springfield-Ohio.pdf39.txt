The image contains a hand-drawn sketch showing the shape of a phenomenon that the observer is describing. The sketch depicts an object with two elongated shapes, possibly representing a UFO or other aerial phenomenon. There are also some handwritten notes that describe the size and movement of the observed object.

15. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the phenomenon. Include and label any details that might have appeared at various positions, or which might indicate the direction the phenomenon was moving.

16. What was the angular size? Hold a match at arms length in front of a known object, such as a street light or barn, and estimate the approximate size of the object. This will give an indication of the size of the phenomenon at the time it was observed. The size it would have been covered by the match head.
