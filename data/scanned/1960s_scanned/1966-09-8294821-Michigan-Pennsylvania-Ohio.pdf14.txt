"Lite Lights Sky
N.Y. to Illinois

Romney Thought 
He Was Attacked

A meteorite lightened skies over much of the eastern part of the nation tonight, and a flaming object described as 'a bright orange-white light' was reported over Shelby county, Ind., Marion, Ind.

The reports came to in-
house switchboards through 
police and fire department
calls from New York to Il-
linois and Michigan.

Michigan Gov. George Rom-
ney, who was flying from
Sault Ste. Marie to Detroit, 
Mich., said the meteorite 
made a 'loud noise' and 'ter-
rifying experience.'

'We thought we were under
attack,' Romney said.

The meteorite was reported
in the northern part of the 
state, and police departments 
in several areas were flooded 
with calls. Fragments of the
burning object were reported 
down in a farm field near the
tiny town of Swanville, Ind.,
where witnesses said it arrived
in a shower of light and was on the ground for several minutes before disappearing.

In Chicago, the chief meteorologist at the U.S. Weather Bureau office said the
light was seen by several persons in his city, but he assured the public there was
not a 'plane crash or any type of calamity.' The light, he said, was a 'natural phenomena' and that portions of the object fell near the Wayne-Oakland farm
near Swanville, A number of farmers in that area reported they saw the object fall.

The local weather bureau said the object was a 'full moon rocket' which had
landed in the area of the Wayne-Oakland farm, but a spokesman said they thought
it was a plane that crashed.

This was one of the biggest and most brilliant meteoric displays seen in this
area in years, meteorologists said.
