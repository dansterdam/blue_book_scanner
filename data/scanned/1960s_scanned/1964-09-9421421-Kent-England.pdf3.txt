The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document that is part of a Project Blue Book report.

REPORT TO THE U.S.A.F. BLUEBOOK PROJECT.

You will see from the enclosed U.F.O. and A.F.O. analyses the conclusion on the flight of the U.F.O. That the information as regards the sighting was sufficient to conclude that the object was seen (it's existence established) and an assessment could be made.

They main points of the incident in this case were that the object/objects were sighted over a longer period, they performed maneuvers on a significant scale and the conclusions arrived at were fully satisfactory.

I trust this additional communication and explanation is helpful. Please let me know if you need any further details.
