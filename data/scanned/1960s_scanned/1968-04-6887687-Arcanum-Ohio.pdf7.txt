The image contains a photograph of an old document from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a form used to record details about a UFO sighting. The form is titled "APPEARANCE OF ROCKET PLUME" and includes various checkboxes and fields for recording information about the observed phenomenon. While the form does not contain a photograph, it describes the witness's observations, including details about the object's movement and disappearance. The document also includes a handwritten note at the bottom that states "Just happened to notice it."
