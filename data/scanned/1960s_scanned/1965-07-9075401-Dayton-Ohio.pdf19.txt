Say Reports From Portugal
LIBSON, PORTUGAL - According to Portuguese sources, the Portuguese press reported several flying saucer sightings in the northern part of the country late in the afternoon of March 25th. The witnesses claimed interference from an electrical disturbance in their daily activities.
THE FIRST REPORTED INCIDENT was when Fernando Fernandes, a carpenter, had just returned home from work when he and his wife at first saw a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to approach their residence and hovered a short distance above their home. It had orange coloring and seemed to oscillate from side to side.
The saucer stopped at rather high altitude, the witnesses said, and sent out what looked like a beam of light. At this point, Fernandes lost control of their radio, which stopped playing. After some minutes, the light disappeared in the direction from which it had come.
A PHYSICAL TRACE was left on the ground where the beam of light had struck, and it was examined by the Weather Bureau in the Azores. The branch also reported the incident to the Geographical Institute in Lisbon.
