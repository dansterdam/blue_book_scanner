IF A FULL MOON FLASHED ON IN 1-2 SECOND INTERVALS AT WOULD APPEAR VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW. IT WOULD HALF BE BRIGHT AS THE LARGE AND SHAPE IS VERY CLOSE. AS LARGE AND A LITTLE BRIGHTER THAN THE FULL MOON. THE COLOR AND SHAPE IS VERY CLOSE.

WHEN WE PARKED AT THIS PLACE WE WERE DISTURBED BY A LIGHT THAT KEPT FLASHING ON AND OFF. IT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW EXCEPT IT WAS MUCH BRIGHTER. THIS LIGHT FLASHED ON AND OFF IN INTERVALS OF 1-2 SECONDS. WE WATCHED IT FOR A WHILE AND THEN IT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED BEHIND SOME TREES. WE DROVE OVER TO WHERE IT HAD BEEN BUT COULD NOT SEE IT ANYMORE. WHEN IT FLASHED ON IT LIT UP THE WHOLE SKY. IT WAS SO BRIGHT. IT DID NOT SEE THE GROUND THAT IT WAS NEAR. WE COULD ONLY SEE A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY.
