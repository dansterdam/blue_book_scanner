SUBJECT: UFO Observations, 13 Apr - 5 May 65, Oak Lawn, Illinois

TO: RQ USAF SAFOI-CC (Mrs Hunt)
Washington, D.C. 20330

1. REFERENCE the attached letter from reporting 
unidentified flying objects. The following evaluations have 
been made concerning the various observations reported by the 
observer:

a. The observation of 13 Apr 65 has characteristics normally 
associated with balloons or as low flying aircraft, small 
kites.

b. The sighting of 29 Apr 65 contained a statement that the 
object was moving quite slowly; however, the duration was reported 
as erratic. The object was reported to be larger than a normal 
aircraft and to change direction at times.

c. The sightings of 1 May from 9:12 pm to 9:50 pm are consistent 
with the observation of satellites. The objects sighted are the same 
as PI-A and the Planet MARS. Both of these are astronomical objects 
and in the observed time of the observation are at the expected position.

d. The observations at 7:47 pm and 10:09 pm are similar to 
reports of satellites or satellites remanents. It is likely that he observed 
one of the other satellites or an aircraft.

2. It is suggested that a Fact Sheet be forwarded to Mr [REDACTED].
