The image appears to contain two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the label "A" on it, with an illustration of a horizon line behind it. The second sketch shows a larger landscape view with a person standing on a road, and two smaller sketches on the right side showing different perspectives of the horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the subject was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" as its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
