The image does not contain any photographs, but rather various diagrams and illustrations. The first diagram shows a curved line representing the horizon, with instructions to imagine the observer's position and the position of an object in the sky. The second diagram is a compass rose, likely used to indicate the direction of the observed object. The third diagram shows the motion and path of a single object, with instructions to draw the motion. The fourth diagram shows multiple objects of different shapes, with instructions to draw how they were arranged and the direction they were traveling.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the line to show how high it was above the horizon when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
