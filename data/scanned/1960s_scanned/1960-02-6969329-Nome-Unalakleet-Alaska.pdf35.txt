SECOND ALASKA SIGHTING
For three weeks 
a man and woman sighted a strange object in the sky over Nome, Alaska. On January 13, 1960, at about 6:50 PM, the object was again sighted, this time by a husband and wife, in the sky over Nome. The object was described as a large, shiny, metallic object hovering in the sky. It remained stationary for about 30 seconds and then began to move rapidly, disappearing from sight in about 5 seconds.
The object was also sighted on January 14 and 15, 1960, by several other people in the Nome area, including a pilot who stated the object was similar in appearance to a small airplane, but was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. The sightings were reported to the Air Force.
On January 18, 1960, the object was again sighted over Nome by a woman walking near her home. She stated the object was a large, bright, round object which hovered for several minutes and then disappeared rapidly. This sighting was also reported to the Air Force.
The Air Force stated that the object could not be identified, and that the sightings were unexplained.
