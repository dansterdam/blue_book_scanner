There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old document or report, containing handwritten text describing an encounter with what seems to be a UFO or unidentified flying object.

The next day, another friend told me that at the same time that we headed west after that one, he was on his way home, and he saw one back behind our house. Then at the same time that we chased after the other one the one behind our house which seemed to be ready to land, then took off. It seemed to me that these two were together, and that as the one was getting ready to settle down to find a place to land, then the one that I saw may have seen that I saw him, and signaled to the other one that he was seen and that he was leaving. So the other one took off with it.
