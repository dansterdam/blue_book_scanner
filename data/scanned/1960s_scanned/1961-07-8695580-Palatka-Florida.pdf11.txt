Dear Sir,

On the night of July 25, about two minutes after midnight, four flashing objects were observed over the country of Putnam. They were moving from the east and at a very high rate of speed. They flew in a straight line and turned at a very sharp angle when they had traveled a considerable distance. At about 75 to 100 feet from the ground they turned again to the west and disappeared. The sighting lasted for about ten seconds. The objects were about the size of a small automobile and gave off a bluish-white light. There were no sound or trails of any kind. These were not planes, satellites or anything the observers had ever seen before. Incident report.
