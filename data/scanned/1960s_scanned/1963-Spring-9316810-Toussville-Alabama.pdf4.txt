Dear Sir:

I have been unable to pass up the opportunity to write to you regarding subject matter about which I was not something that seemed to us to have pleased. Please first let me express the pleasure I felt over (early part) of spring. My wife and I were in our backyard gardening. while thus engaged, we happened to look up at the exact minute, we would not - but for having been so at the moment - have noticed a lighted object of some kind approaching us from the west and passing over in a northeasterly direction. This was not a balloon or any other thing with which we were familiar. Nor was it like a plane or anything having usual shape. Here is how I would describe it:

It was a rather brilliantly lighted object, looking quite white, shaped somewhat like a flattened sphere. It was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, straight and level, without any hesitation in its flight. It was not affected by the wind, for the distance it covered in so short a time was amazing. What really struck us as strange was the fact that there was no sound whatsoever accompanying its passage. Upon disappearing, it left no trail or vapor behind it. We were simply awestruck at what we had witnessed. It all happened so quickly, and the object was traveling so swiftly, that we did not have time to do anything but stand and gaze in sheer amazement.

I hope this letter does not appear to be the ravings of some crank. I can assure you that my wife and I are quite normal, level-headed people. What we saw was definitely not a natural phenomenon as far as we could judge. I want to cooperate fully with your organization in any way I can to help solve this mystery. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to write me. If it would be helpful, I should be glad to come to your office or to some other place convenient to you to discuss this matter further.

Sincerely yours,
