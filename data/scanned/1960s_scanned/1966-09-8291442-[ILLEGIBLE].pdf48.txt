We started the object watching a jet airplane. The plane came from the NNE and made a gradual turn to the west. While the object was watching the airplane, the object began closing in on the airplane. The closer the object came to the airplane, the closer it was turning to the west. There is no way to tell that the object was with the airplane. If it was close to the airplane, it was traveling at the same speed. Another witness said that the object seemed to disappear. The winds were out of the east at the time. The winds that were blowing at the time were out of the west, and they would indicate that the object was blowing in the wind, however, it could not think of anything which would account for the object crossing an arc of 45 degrees in not more than 2 seconds. The object may have been an illusion to the observers, and it was figured that if it was blowing in the wind, it was about 16 inches in diameter and shaped like a cigar. The witness could not remember exactly the apparent size and singular speed of the object.
