26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. The object looked like large glowing object, whitish in color. They were oval shaped and hovered in the sky for several minutes. They seemed to maneuver around one another, as if they were maneuvering. They moved very slowly. Periodically they would gain speed rapidly and then slow down again. It was difficult to gauge their actual speed because they did not remain in one position.
