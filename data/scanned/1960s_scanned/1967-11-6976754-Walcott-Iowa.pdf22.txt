Important:
About a week ago I sent you some information which we were pretty convinced was related to some kind of incident. We not send me any forms to do anything over because of insignificant information because of what I know I want to call over one or more of them. On page one and two of the form is place the witness is and certain information, it may have mentioned it where it says "place" if it was A B" on line " .. " it is not what I want to convey. Anyway after spending considerable time analyzing all of this I must confess that I have done wrong. When I received your reply I was very upset and I'd even go so far as to say that I felt I was the only mistaken individual, but you what I did wrong, and what you can do with all the information I sent you.
