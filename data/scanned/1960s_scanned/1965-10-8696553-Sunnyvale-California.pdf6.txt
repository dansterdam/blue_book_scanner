South America
4 October 63

Throughout October, November, and December, dozens of UFO incidents continued to occur throughout South America. Among the most startling was an incident reported on October 8, concerning three children who claimed they were almost blinded by a small luminous creature, disappearance, which took place at about the same time in Santiago del Estero, where a gigantic creature disappeared "enveloped in a cloud of dust" before the eyes of several children who had gone to get water from a dam. In neither of these cases was a flying saucer seen, according to our information.
