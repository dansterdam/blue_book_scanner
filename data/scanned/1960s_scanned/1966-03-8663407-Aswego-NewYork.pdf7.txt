The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It appeared to slowly just fade away, going to just a white light, and then disappearing completely.

15. Did the object move behind something or at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes. No. Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes. No. Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: A strange, silent, hissing sound was heard.
b. Color: Translucent, pulsating, bright white in color, seen on the horizon.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 2 1/2 times of the match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and specifically about trails or vapor trails.
[Drawing shows a single, elongated object with a slightly blunt, curved front and a larger, more rounded back, with a faint suggestion of a vapor trail behind it.]
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
