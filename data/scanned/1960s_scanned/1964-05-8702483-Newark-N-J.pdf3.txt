Near the N.J. State Police Station it happened to glance back toward the station, while waiting for the traffic light to change. When I noticed a light reflection coming from a object in the sky in the direction of Penn Station, but motorist estimate that the object was 1,000 feet higher 1,500 ft high in the sky. I thought it might be a airplane as that is where the planes sometimes go landing at Newark airport, but this object was stationary. Well, I figured it was a helicopter. But I saw no whirlwind. Just a round metallic object silvery or stainless steel colored, with a little elevation or center where the housing with the controls might be.
