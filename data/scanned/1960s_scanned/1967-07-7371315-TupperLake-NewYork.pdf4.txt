AFRTS Flight Plans And Scheduling
(Westover AFB, Mass 01022)

Our office is in receipt of a reported unidentified flying object (UFO) observation over Tupper Lake, New York. A review of High Speed Training Route Charts indicates that MAJCOM flight plans over the 8th Air Force area on 10 Jul 67 were not in question. However, the agencies, if available, on the watertown Oil Turner (on-site) coordinator's list could have been operating in the vicinity of Tupper Lake, NY on 10 Jul 1967. The sighting.
