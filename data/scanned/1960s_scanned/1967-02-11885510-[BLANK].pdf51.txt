Therefore in the most favorable case the number of civilizations coexisting with ours in the galaxy is equal in order of magnitude to their lifetime t. in years.

Gindilis then quotes two evaluations of the number of civilizations, the first evaluation is that there are not less than one per 10^12 stars (not less than one civilization in five neighboring galaxies). The second evaluation, more optimistic, is that there is one civilization per 10^6 stars or on the order of 10^3 civilizations in the galaxy.

Gindilis then calculates the average distance d between civilizations in the galaxy by using the following formula:

d = (N/n)^1/3

Where d is the average distance between neighboring stars, then assuming d_0 = 7 light years one may calculate the average distance.

d. given values of N and t_c. These results are shown in Table II. Based on Table II and his discussion about the possible number of civilizations in the galaxy, Gindilis concludes that the distance between civilizations is not less than several hundreds of light years, and it is probably more than a thousand light years.
