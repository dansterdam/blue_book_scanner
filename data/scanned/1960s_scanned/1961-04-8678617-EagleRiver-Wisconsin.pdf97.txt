There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to the Secretary of the United States Air Force Command regarding an alleged "flying saucer" landing incident near Eagle River, Wisconsin. The letter discusses how the residents of Wisconsin have read about this incident and how the evidence offered (three small cakes) was disregarded and not analyzed, and that no further information was forthcoming. The letter states that the residents are loyal, taxpaying, American citizens who are anxious to have an honest answer about this incident.

Secretary of the United States Air Force Command
Dear Sir:
We residents of the state of Wisconsin, having read at great length of the recent "flying saucer" landing near Eagle River, Wisconsin, have been much disturbed to hear that the concrete evidence which was offered in this incident (namely, three small cakes) was disregarded and not analyzed, and that no further information was forthcoming.
We do not believe that the handling of this incident was in the so-called "American tradition". We would appreciate your communicating to us any further information about this incident.
We are loyal, tax paying, American citizens who are anxious to have your honest answer.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Mr. and Mrs.
