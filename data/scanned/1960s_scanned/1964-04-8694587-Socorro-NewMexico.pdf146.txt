LANDING PROBED BY ASKS TESTS

U-Shaped Object Seen By Policeman

Evidence on Desert Floor Supports Officer's Story 

SOCORRO, N.M. (AP) - Lonnie Zamora, a Socorro policeman, said he was driving along a desert road 18 miles south of here Friday night when he saw a shiny object on the ground. 

As he pulled up, Zamora said, an object shaped like a letter "U" rose from the ground and flew slowly away. Later, Zamora said, he found an area on the desert floor supporting his claim something had landed there.

The Air Force was called in to investigate the incident. The craft was described as about 15 feet long and 5 or 6 feet wide. 

Zamora said he heard a roar and saw flames as the object rose from the ground and flew over the desert. He said the craft was silver in color and had two legs or landing gears. 

Deputy Sheriff James Luckie said "very few have seen anything like this in the county before." The incident was reported to the sheriff's office at 6 p.m. Friday.
