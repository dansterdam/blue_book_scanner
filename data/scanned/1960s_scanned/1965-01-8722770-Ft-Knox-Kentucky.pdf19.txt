This is the text found in the document:

their merely an taken to show a convoy wowing along. Come one could find to
Cane from articles 4 or 5 mile away. Our came a very mote object move slowly
any than across the sky, moving from East to West. When it to reached about the
center of o sky it stopped and hovered for about a minute. It then moved back
the way it came from East to West with the same deliberate and
pace. During this time it appeared to at times become brighter and at times
dimmer. At the time of the sighting, there were high cirrus clouds in the sky
but the object was definitely above these clouds. The abject was not noticed by
any of the persons in the convoy and the only reason it was observed was
because one of the vehicle drivers happened to glance up at the sky. The
quality of the report would indicate that it was something quite unusual and
not easily explainable as any known type of aircraft. The observer was a very
mature and reliable person and his description of the sighting appears to be
straightforward and factual. He indicated that he was very familiar with the
appearance of conventional aircraft and this was definitely something quite
different.
