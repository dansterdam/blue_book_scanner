I. PURPOSE: Determination of the composition of the soil samples for the purpose of comparison.
II. FACTUAL DATA: The samples were submitted for analysis and assigned Analytical Branch numbers 4-891 - 4-898.
2.- Spectrographic analysis indicated the gross composition to be the same for all samples. The following elements were found in the indicated concentrations:
Principal element - Silicon
Major elements - Mg, Al, Fe, Na, K and Ca
Minor elements - Manganese and Titanium
III. CONCLUSION: There is apparently no significant differences in elemental composition between the different samples.
IV. RECOMMENDATIONS: None, data merely submitted.
