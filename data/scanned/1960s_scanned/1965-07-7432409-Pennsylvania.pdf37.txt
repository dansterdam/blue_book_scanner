There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a historical document, likely related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

FTD (ETAC)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433
25 July 1965

Dear Sir:
Regret for not having written sooner, but I have been out of the office for the past week and I am now just getting back to my normal routine.

With regards to your letter of 15 July, I will try to answer your questions as completely as possible.

The object, which you and your neighbors observed on 12 July, was a pressure research balloon. This balloon is an upper-atmospheric research balloon used to study cosmic rays and atmospheric conditions. It is 300 feet in diameter (measuring instrument package) and was approximately 120 feet high. It appears that this balloon was released in Canada by an industrial company who was conducting research for the U.S. Navy. I honestly don't know the answer to that one.

I need, etc. Your type or your description of the object, its motion, color, size, any other details you can provide, would be most helpful.

SINCERELY,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.
Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
