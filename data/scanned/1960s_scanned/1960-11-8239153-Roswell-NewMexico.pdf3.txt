Text output from the document:

IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE NO ACTUAL PHYSICAL REMAINS OF ANY CRASHED OBJECT OR HUMANOID IN THE JULY 1947 INCIDENT NEAR ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO. THE INCIDENT WAS MOST LIKELY RELATED TO THE RECOVERY OF MATERIALS FROM A PROJECT MOGUL BALLOON OPERATION.

ALTHOUGH OBSERVER DESCRIPTORS SUGGEST SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY WAS OBSERVED, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL SPACECRAFT OR ALIEN BODIES WERE RECOVERED. THE MOST PROBABLE EXPLANATION IS THAT THE MATERIALS RECOVERED NEAR ROSWELL WERE DEBRIS FROM A PROJECT MOGUL HIGH-ALTITUDE BALLOON OPERATION.

WITNESS DESCRIPTIONS AND OFFICIAL AIR FORCE STATEMENTS ABOUT "FLYING DISCS" AND "CRASHED SAUCERS" WERE MOST LIKELY ACTUAL SIGHTINGS AND RECOVERIES OF CLASSIFIED PROJECT MOGUL BALLOONS AND THEIR PAYLOADS. THERE IS NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT ANY MATERIALS RECOVERED NEAR ROSWELL WERE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN OR REPRESENTED ANYTHING OTHER THAN A BALLOON OPERATION.
