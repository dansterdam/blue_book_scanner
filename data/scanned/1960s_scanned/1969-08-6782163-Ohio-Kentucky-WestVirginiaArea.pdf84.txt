SUBJECT: Fireball Sightings, 5 August 1969 

Your name has been given to the Aerial Phenomena Office as having seen an extremely bright meteor, called a fireball, in the early morning hours of 5 August 1969. If this is true, we would like you to complete the attached AF Form 117 on your sighting and return it to us in the enclosed self-addressed envelope.

The data contained in these reports will then be forwarded to Dr. Charles Olivier who is the head of the American Meteor Society. The data contained in these reports will then be used to compute the trajectory of the fireball and the probable impact point of the meteorite. Thank you for your cooperation.
