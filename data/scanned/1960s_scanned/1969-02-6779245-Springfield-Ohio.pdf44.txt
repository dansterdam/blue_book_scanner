Sighted by  (b) five  at  the Lincoln Line (Route 12) 
just north of Springfield, Ohio about 8:30 PM on January 30, 1969.  

The object was described as being approximately 200 ft diameter and was about 300-400 feet off the ground. It was elliptical in shape and was giving off a white-orange glow. The object was silent and did not have any visible markings.  

There were no witnesses in the car with the observer, but other observers saw the object from different locations. The object was observed for about 20-30 seconds and then accelerated and moved out of sight at a high rate of speed. 

The observer indicated that he had served in the military, was a former jet pilot, and was very familiar with aircraft. He stated he was certain this was not any known type of aircraft. The location of the observation was 126 degrees northwest of the Cambridge Radar Station.
