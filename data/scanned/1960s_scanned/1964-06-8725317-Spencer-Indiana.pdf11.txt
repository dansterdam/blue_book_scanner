Sightings at Seaton Burn
On the night of the 29th May, 1964, Mr. Wood, Mr. Wagstaff, and Mr. Shipley sighted an object high in the sky over Seaton Burn. It was disc-shaped, glowing, and seemed to be pulsating at a rapid rate. It hovered at a high altitude for several minutes, then moved off very quickly to the west.
Some time later, Mr. Wood and his wife saw the same or a similar object, again high in the sky over Seaton Burn. It was large and disc-shaped, and appeared to give off a pulsating glow. It hovered for some time, then rapidly moved off to the west.
Mr. Wood telephoned the police to report the sighting, but the object had vanished by the time they arrived. He then contacted local RAF stations, but they could offer no explanation for what had been seen.
The witnesses were all reliable people, and seemed genuinely puzzled and somewhat disturbed by what they had seen. They all described the object in similar terms, and are convinced that they saw something quite out of the ordinary.
