There were about two or us as we watch the place at nite. we was waiting for my boy to come home from a date and I was waiting for my husband to come home. about 12:25 our boy walked in the lights thing was about 15 to 20 minutes. It wasn't a plane. it was round in shape and was not blinking and there was just one light this person first move and signaled as to see what it was. we will and watched it but we thought it was a plane like I said. it couldn't be an Illinois plane and works at Lee's Airport.
I have seen more but no one would even know they are not there if they haven't had some sighting. I have had.
