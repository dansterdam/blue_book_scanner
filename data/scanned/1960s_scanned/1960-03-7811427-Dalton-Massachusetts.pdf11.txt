7 April 1960
MEMO FOR: Major Friend
SUBJECT: Report of Dalton, Mass. Ice Fall, 25 March 1960

1. A. R. ACUFF, Jr. of Dalton, Mass. reported the fall of many pounds of ice from the sky. Dalton, Mass. reported the fall of many pounds of ice and asked him to get a sample of the ice in the freezer. Later in the week, he was instructed to forward the sample to Dalton, Mass. (CG 0 miles) found this ice to be from the sample that he took and the rainfall sample.

2. The circumstances of the fall were these: Shortly before 10:30, the teacher's 15 year old son returned from an errand, making cautious tracks in the snow. Shortly after, a loud noise was heard and pieces of ice were dashed outside thinking that there had been a baseball thrown through the house. Examination disclosed that there were a number of pieces of ice, some the size of a softball, scattered about the yard. The landing of the ice is pictured in the enclosure and also close-ups of the ice. It was determined that the pattern of the ice is shown in the included diagram.

3. The ice itself was considerably less dense than ordinary ice for it was quite coarse and a chunk the size of a baseball weighed only about one pound. By no consideration could the frozen snow-ice be thought the same as the surrounding snow, and it did not lie under any scheduled airline.

4. A sample of the water has been given to be analyzed at Smithsonian for analysis at Wright Field.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek

NOTE: Water sample should be analyzed for types of water (coastal, rain, distilled, etc.), mineral content, and organic content; and such other analyses as is necessary to determine the composition of the frozen water.
