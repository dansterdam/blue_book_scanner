17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Sound: none
b. Color: the white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match stick. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would the match have covered?
it was very small so a match would only cover a small portion of it.  it was imagining, but, it seemed larger.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you have described such as wings, gins, exhaust, etc. Please use a ruler to enhance your drawing.
