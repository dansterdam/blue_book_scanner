SUBJECT: 120 INCIDENT
Richard M______
Westbury, New York

1. On 7 March 1960, a report of an unidentified flying object was 1-ceived by an ALAS4A radar unit at Godman Air Force Base, Kentucky. The object was tracked for approximately 50 minutes, but no visual contact could be made because of overcast conditions. The report indicated that the object was traveling at high speed and made abrupt changes in direction.

2. It is suggested that if the crew of the above flight can be identified, the information and extended radar track be considered to possibly corroborate the evidence of the incidents reported.

Sincerely

RICHARD G. EVANS
