Dear Miss _____,

This is in reply to your letter regarding unidentified flying objects.

Your observation on 3 September 1965 is similar to many reports of sightings of unidentified flying objects.

The data which you presented on your first observation is insufficient to provide a firm identification. The Air Force uses a form should be completed as fully as possible and returned to this office so that an evaluation can be made.

In accordance with a report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force UFO project, this report contains information on this program since its origin in 1947. I hope this will be of interest to you.

The books by Donald Keyhoe are considered by the Air Force to be accurate fiction.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. SPAULDING
