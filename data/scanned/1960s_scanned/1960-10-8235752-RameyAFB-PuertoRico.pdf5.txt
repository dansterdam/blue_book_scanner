Dear Director,

There is some new development on the project mentioned your office. The material we sent sample to you has been subjected to various tests which gave rather unusual results. I shall be pleased to discuss these with you further if you so desire.

We were at this city yesterday and had a chance to discuss the matter with ----- and he was able to clarify some points which were rather obscure. We all thanked because of his assistance -- he has been most cooperative.

So far there is nothing further to report, please send me any comments or suggestions you may have.

Sincerely yours,
