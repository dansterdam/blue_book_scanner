Memo, AFOTN-2EXZ, 11 Oct 60, Request for Analysis
1st Ind (AFOTN-2EXZ/Ws. Bryant/20/1950)
3rd Ind AFOTN-2EXZ
1. The facts as presented in this report are insufficient to support a firm conclusion about the "incident" reported from a range of 20 miles to a range of 2 miles at a speed of 2800 knots indicates that the target was observed for about 1/3 minute. This is rather short time to observe the target on radar and correlate a visual observation.
2. The speed of a large aircraft is normally less than the speed indicated, and the great altitude of such observations and the fact that the target was not on collision course with an aircraft target. On the other hand, anomalous propagation frequently causes false targets on radar scope traveling at apparently fantastic speeds, and it appears that this might well be the answer here.
