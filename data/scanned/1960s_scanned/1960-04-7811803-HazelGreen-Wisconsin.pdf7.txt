NEW UFO MOVIE SUBMITTED
TO AIR FORCE
A new UFO movie, filmed in Wisconsin, has been submitted to the Air Force for analysis. The movie, showing three bright UFOs, has been viewed by NICAP member Charles Maney, Decatur, Illinois, who reported the details to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena.
The movie was filmed by a Hazel Green, Wisconsin man on April 4 (not March 4 as previously stated). The man, who has remained anonymous, took the film on a sunny afternoon for 30 seconds.
The successful color movie was taken by NICAP member Hazel Grant, Wisconsin, according to NICAP. The UFOs are visible for about 20 seconds in the film.
The NICAP spokesman told the paper that the sighting will be covered in a later issue.
