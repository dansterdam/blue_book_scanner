As I was walking the street, a radiant star-like object suddenly became bright, turned, and accelerated, and then returned to its usual size. During the flight it appeared stationary and when I got out of my car to look at it more closely, it stopped and retraced its steps going back the way it had come. This apparently controlled maneuver lasted be t a minute or two minutes and then the finally went off to the northwest receding in absolute silence. I would probably have dismissed the sights how, a very unusual one, but out the following morning the newspaper carried the story of a UFO sighting over Yonkers, New York on the evening of October 8, 1966. The description matched what I had seen.
