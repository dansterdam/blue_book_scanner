The sky was perfectly clear and the stars provided a good background for our sighting. The object was observed for 35 deg.

The only other airplane activity in the area was a small plane at high altitude (over 30,000 feet) which was descending. This plane was not considered to have any connection with the object observed.

The total time of the sighting was estimated to be 4 to 5 minutes.

At the end of this period, the object appeared to descend slightly, then accelerate rapidly and disappear.

We will be pleased to answer any further questions.

Yours truly,
