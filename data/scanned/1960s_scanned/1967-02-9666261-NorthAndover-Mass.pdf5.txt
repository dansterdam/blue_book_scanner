The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text that seems to be related to a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Transcribing the text from the document:

4. The object was at about 20 degrees above the horizon and moved from northwest to southeast.

5.1 Lasted approximately 3 minutes. 

5.2 The object moved in a straight line and maintained a constant size and brightness.

6. It was about the size of a dime held at arm's length and was blue-green in color. It appeared to be glowing or emitting its own light.
