Transcribing the text on the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 2 April, 1968

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object was triangular in shape, approximately 100 x 50 feet in diameter, which is larger than the average aircraft. The object then moved out of my binocular view, then reappeared briefly near the western horizon. They were traveling in a westerly direction at a very high rate of speed. The object appeared to be metallic or shiny and did not appear to flash or blink like aircraft normally do. It maintained a steady orange-red glow the entire time I observed it.
