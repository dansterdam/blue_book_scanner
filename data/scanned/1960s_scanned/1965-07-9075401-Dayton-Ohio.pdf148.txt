The image appears to contain a diagram and some text, but no photograph of a human face. The diagram shows a compass-like object, as well as a diagram depicting the path of an unidentified object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please indicate the course line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the course line to show the direction of the object when you first saw it. Place a "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
