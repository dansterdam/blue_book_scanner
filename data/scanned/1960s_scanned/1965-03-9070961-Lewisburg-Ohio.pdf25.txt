PROCEEDED to the US Weather Station at Sulphur Grove and interviewed Mr. who provided the wind data for their 1800 launch. This balloon rose to 98,000 ft and burst. It did not carry a light. Time of burst occurred at approximately 1930. (See attached Data) The balloon was 6.5 ft in diameter, white, expanding to about 26 ft at altitude of burst.)

Departed from UFO office at PTD for Base Operations to obtain local WX data. At 2200 on 30 March the winds were from 060 deg at 45 knots. Temperature was 30 deg-local wind data indicated that the winds at the launch area could have been over the Lewisburg area.

Information regarding balloons launched from this site in general revealed that the only launch that carries a light is the midnight (2400 local) launch. The light on this balloon is a white flashlight type of a light. The nearest other US Weather balloons launches are at Flint, Michigan, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Canton, Illinois. The average bursting altitude of the rawinsonde is 90,000 and the rate of climb between 750-800 ft per minute. The only time that this ascent is slowed is when ice forms on the balloons from the atmosphere. Under icing conditions the balloon may maintain the same altitude, fall or rise more slowly.
