Dr. D. R. Saunders and J. H. Rush followed with examination of the instrumentation required for the conducting of UFO investigations. They compared various light sources with interpretations of their various spectra. The investigation included the analysis of films available and their identification as of natural or artificial phenomena.

The last two items, analysis, and validity of the sightings, technique of the same was used in aircraft accident investigations.
