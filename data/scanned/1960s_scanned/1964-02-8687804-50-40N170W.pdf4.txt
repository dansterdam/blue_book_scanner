Kent Mystery
Attempts continue to appear
In England. On February 20 the
London Daily Telegraph and many
other newspapers reported that a
story had appeared to be large in
the Cromer area. Three people had informed the police
that they had seen an animal on a
road near Cromer, East Ruam.
Thirty police from the
area were employed in the search and
the police reported to television for
further information as they were
unable to identify the animal seen.
Descriptions which included a tiger, a
puma, a lion and a cheetah.
Because two of the people had
seen strange and evasive animals
may have some connection with flying
saucers may the to refer to the South
African occurrence reported on page
15. However, it was pointed out that
first indications the two motorists
received were the appearance of a
large animal lying across the road.
This was seen followed by the appearance
of a saucer which made several
dives at the car. Could it be that
these animals are related by UFOS
and living conditions? If so, the
picture would fit the cat could be
planted as a diversion intended to
distract the observers. This would be
important to the saucer pilots. It
must be remembered that our first
sighting indicates animals were down
first.
