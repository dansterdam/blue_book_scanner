INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: AN AIR AND SPACE LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 45 MILES NORTH OF MORON AIR BASE REPORTED OBSERVING NO ACTIVITY AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. SOURCE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF EXPERIENCE OBSERVING METEOROLOGICAL ACTIVITY. HE SAID THAT THE OBJECT LOOKED AND BEHAVED LIKE A PIECE OF SPACE HARDWARE REENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE RATHER THAN A METEOROLOGICAL EVENT. HE BASED THIS ON HIS READINGS OF THE EFFECTS OF REENTRY BODIES RATHER THAN ANY PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS. FROM THE COMMENT OF THE OBSERVER IT APPEARS THAT THE OBJECT WAS A LARGE METEOR OR A SPACE VEHICLE WHOSE ENTRY STAGE REENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE WAS OBSERVED. DUE TO THE RELATIVELY SLOW SPEED OF THE OBJECT PLUS THE INTENSE LIGHT GIVEN OFF IT APPEARS MORE LIKELY THAT IT WAS A SPACE VEHICLE OF SOME SORT RATHER THAN A METEOR.
