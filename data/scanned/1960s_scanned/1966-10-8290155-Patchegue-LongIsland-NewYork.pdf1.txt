11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched a light in the SE that was flashing red. The object was seen just the flashing lights. There was very slow movement noted by the witnesses. Once the object disappeared, the object was first observed at the horizon, the SE and it was still there two hours later. It then went into a vertical motion, straight up, and this motion took about 10-15 seconds. The duration of the sighting was about 2 hours. The sighting raises out such an explanation. The object, according to the witness, was low on the horizon and from the area should have been quite visible. Kennedy and Randle did not actually report any unusual appearance or activity to substantiate the report that he could see the same object the next night. He called back and said that he had seen Sirius and it was just like what he had seen.
