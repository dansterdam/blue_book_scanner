The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing text and handwritten responses to questions about a UFO sighting. 

Transcription of the text on the page:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) YES. Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) YES. No. Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what: clear sky.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: no sound
b. Color: bright white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? The angular size of the object could not be accurately measured.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Please an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The exhaust-visible; at the distant it looked like a round star-shaped object.
