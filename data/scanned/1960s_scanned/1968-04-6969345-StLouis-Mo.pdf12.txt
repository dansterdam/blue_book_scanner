The object was cigar shaped rather than round and appeared to be some type of aircraft. It was dark in color but there did not appear to be any lights on it. It was moving slowly and silently, sometimes hovering and sometimes moving forward. At one point it tilted so that the bottom could be seen and it appeared to be completely dark. The motion was unusual and erratic. It seemed to be under some kind of intelligent control. It was observed for several minutes and was not thought to be an ordinary aircraft.
