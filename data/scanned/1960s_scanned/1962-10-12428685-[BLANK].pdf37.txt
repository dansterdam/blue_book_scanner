The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the United States.

The text in the document is as follows:

Air Intelligence Branch
Department of Intelligence Training
37504 Technical School, USAF (ATC)
Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas

29 October 1962

FTD (TD-E2H)
Attn: Major Howard F. Greene
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

Enclosed are two copies of the syllabus for the FTD course that we discussed on 27 September with Col. Wyms. We apologize for its being late; we just received it from the printers yesterday.

We are still anticipating the "Gross" question run when you get it and the UFO pictures from LtCol Friend.
