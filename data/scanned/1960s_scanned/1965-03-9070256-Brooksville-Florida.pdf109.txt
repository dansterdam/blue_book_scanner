The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document states:

The concentric and eccentric pad footprints are represented in the attached sketches to indicate the possible reasons why:
(1) All four holes are approximately six inches deep. 
(2) Both measurements indicate good footprint impressions and (3) unequal.
From the dimensions of the UFO, it has been determined that the pad imprints spread even though the vehicle may not have been sufficient to prevent overturning of the vehicle. 
Additional information should have been recorded at the landing site, such as the direction of the eccentric pad footprint indentations, i.e. inboard or outboard direction.
The measurements of the impressions serve to determine the soil strength around the holes and at the bottom of the holes would indicate whether or not the vehicle was compact or scooped out.
There are many questions left unanswered, such as why the holes were not distorted during the take-off and whether characteristics of the soil itself could explain the size and shape of the impressions from the facts at hand. It is concluded that a landing with the near geometry and pad indentations above are theoretically possible.
In the soil itself in a case such as this could be utilized to provide further information. It is recommended that in future occasions the following steps are taken:
a. Determine the soil bearing strength values around the area.
b. Measure the footprint areas and depth (of the vehicle landing gear and the crewmen).
c. Obtain plaster casts of all footprints.
From the preceding information data on vehicle and crewmen weights could be estimated.
