The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document with handwritten instructions and a diagram.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you saw the object shown. Please show how you would have seen it. Place a "T" and show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" and show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the earth's path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
