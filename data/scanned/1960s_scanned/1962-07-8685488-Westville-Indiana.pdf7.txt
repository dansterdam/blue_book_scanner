20 July 
76 m 64
Dear Sirs; 
While I was at camp with my Boy Scout troop I saw an unusual light in the sky. I saw the object at about 8:15 p.m. which is located about 1 1/2 miles in a westerly direction from our camp. The object remained stationary for a period of approximately 10 to 15 minutes. It then began to slowly move in a northerly direction. As it moved north, it began to lose its brilliance and soon disappeared from sight. The object was brilliantly lit and appeared to be oval in shape. I was never able to get a clear view of the details because the sky was partly cloudy and the object was rather high in the sky. This sighting was made on July 18, 1962 at approximately 8:15 p.m. in the vicinity of Westville, Indiana.

Sincerely yours,
Hammond, Ind.
