And, a Reuters dispatch from Rio de Janeiro, dated August 27th, quotes an article in a newspaper called "Brazil Herald", written by a journalist of 20 years experience, who claims to have personally met two occupants of a flying saucer. Gabriel Ramos Mello, says that he saw a UFO the size of a small airplane, land in a rice field. He communicated with the two-man crew telepathically, he claims. They informed him that they come from another solar system, and they seemed very intelligent. No further details are given in the Reuters story.
