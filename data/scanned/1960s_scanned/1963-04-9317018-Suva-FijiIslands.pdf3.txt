EXCERPT FROM THE FIJI TIMES DATA ANALYSIS

MANY PEOPLE SAW FIERY 'SPACE SHIP' OVER FIJI

A Tamavua housewife woke about 3.30 a.m. yesterday and passed a straight through her window into what appeared to be a fiery star 1n the sky. 

Mrs. "almost horrified," it was a frightening experience, she said.

"It was my husband who got out of bed quicker than I," she said.

"I said I had been dreaming, but I insisted that I had actually seen the object."

But about 10 minutes earlier, earlier three "sudden limp" seamen on a merchant ship cruising in the area, had reported seeing something resembling a "flying object" moving rapidly from west to east, with a brilliant illumination.

Members of the RSAF were alerted to the object, and a Lautokaraessage states that reports of strange lights seen in the area have been confirmed, and that about 3.30 a.m. a large object appeared from the southeastern horizon and flew at high speed over Lautoka town.

An officer said that at that time the object was as 1arge as a Jumbo jet, and that it was making a shrill whistling noise. 

The course the object took was out over Natova and then it returned in a north-northwest direction. Its flight was observed for a considerable time by several people in Lautoka.
