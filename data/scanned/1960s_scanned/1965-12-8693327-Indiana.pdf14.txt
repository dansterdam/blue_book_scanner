Gentleman,

I have just returned from a second trip to Mount Beach and I am happy to report on the event.

Since I sighted that thing over County I suppose you are the people to whom I should report.

At approx 10:15 pm and for about 15 mins starting through the window to watch a circular object like an ilumanated window hovering over the city of Pittsburgh when we were looking out the window to watch it.

A swift lit shaped object also seemed to be flying manuvered for a split second then going into a 70 climb with an orange flames. Then appearing behind it. It was a matter of 3 to 4 seconds it was gone just like a rocket taking off the ground. 

That was the event I wanted to report than ever before more news.
