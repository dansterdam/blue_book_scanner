Text extracted from the document:

At about 7:50 p.m., 9 August 1965, Mrs. Ruth Ammons, her daughter Judy, and others were sitting on the front porch of their home on Dunn Lake Road, Bunkie, Louisiana. Their attention was attracted by a bright light in the sky which seemed to be moving slowly northeast. They observed the light for approximately five minutes before it disappeared. Mrs. Ammons stated that the light was brighter than any star she had ever seen, and that it appeared to change colors from orange to green. She added that the light did not appear to flicker or twinkle like a star, but seemed to move steadily. The witness said that the light was visible for about 5 minutes before disappearing from sight. No definite details of size, shape, or altitude could be determined from the witnesses' observations. They felt, however, that the light was at a considerable distance from their location.
