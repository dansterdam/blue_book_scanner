The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to "Mr. [redacted]" from "INSPECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF, Chief, Project Blue Book" regarding the analysis of an unidentified flying object observation and photograph.

The text in the letter states:

"Dear [redacted],

Reference your recent observation and photograph of an unidentified flying object. Photographic analysis revealed that the image is such that no specific details are visible other than a circular object with some type of perturbation which can be made of the object.

Analysis revealed that if the object had a diameter of 15 feet, it would be detected 1.30 radials from the camera, but if the object were larger, say 30 feet, it would be detected 2.59 radials from the camera, but no further data is available.

Lack of foreground and/or background detail precluded a scale factor to measure the size of the object.

The original photograph will be returned to you under separate cover. The copy is being made for the case history only. Under no circumstances will the photograph be released to the news media.

Thank you for submitting the photograph for analysis.

INSPECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book"
