The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire with various questions about an unidentified object sighting.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one:) Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of anything at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one:) Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound None
b. Color Bright, Glowing, Yellow

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust or vapor trails. Please do not insert the drawing you made in the questionnaire, but rather describe it using text.
"a bright spot or sphere with light extending like a tail or protrusion"
