Sir:

Recently there have been claims of recent UFO sightings. Please send me information concerning any reported cases if there is a charge for the articles, please send me a price list so that I may order some material. Perhaps it is true that all reports are entered under the label of "MGGRRT" if so I would like to have some concrete reasons for this action. A case in point in the sightings in June of 1964 at Pease Air Force Base in Maine. These sightings were turned over to the Foreign technological division of the Air Force Systems Command. After that nothing was ever heard. It could have been lack of press coverage or perhaps it was lack of answers from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. In any case I would greatly appreciate receiving any information whatsoever concerning your philosophy towards UFOs. Thank you very much.

Yours truly,
