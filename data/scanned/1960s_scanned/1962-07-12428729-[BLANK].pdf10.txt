Unidentified Flying Objects                                  22 July 1963

Andrews AFB, Md.

1. Attached is a copy of our proposed response to a request for information on the USAF Unidentified Flying Objects program from Congressman Carl Vinson. This proposed reply was sent to AFNIN for forwarding to SAFLL.

2. Partly due to the efforts of private UFO organizations (the other, during the week of 10 July 1960, was described as a hearing), the house has held two briefings on the UFO program for Congressmen since 1958; the other, during the week of 10 July 1960, when we briefed Mr. Richard F. Hines of the House Space and Astronautics Committee during his visit to PMS. Hines was gathering background information for Congressman Joseph Karth, a member of the committee, as a result of Mr. Karth's recommendation that there be no hearings.

3. Also attached is a copy of an article which will appear in the next edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. The article was written by the Consultant of the UFO program since 1948, Dr. Hynek. He has been consultant to the UFO program since 1948. We have suggested that a copy of this article accompany the letter to Congressman Vinson.
