The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a form labeled "AFR 80-17(C1)" that seems to be requesting information about a UFO sighting.

The text on the form includes questions about the observer's experiences, such as whether they used binoculars or reading glasses, whether they noticed any physical effects, and whether they were able to obtain a clear picture of the object. The form also has sections for the observer to describe the object they saw and any other relevant information.
