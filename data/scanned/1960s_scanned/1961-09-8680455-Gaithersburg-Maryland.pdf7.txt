The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, and an object above the horizon representing the UFO sighting. The second sketch shows a larger silhouetted object in the distance, with the observer's position marked as point "A" and the object's position as point "B".

OCR text from the document:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
