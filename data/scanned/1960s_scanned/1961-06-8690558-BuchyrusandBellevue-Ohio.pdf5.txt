Text extracted from the document:

This was called to report that an object in the sky was observed to pass over the trees that border a Buehyrus & Bellevue, Ohio, Airport. It was described as being about 8-10 ft. in diameter, luminous or glowing, and moving in a slow or steady speed at an altitude of about 500 ft. It was observed for about 45-60 seconds. The object was estimated to be about 3 miles from the observers' location.

The report states that two of the witness's daughters had also observed the object and that they would appreciate hearing from you as to what that object was. The shapes drawn were to indicate the shape of the objects seen.
