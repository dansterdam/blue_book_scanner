TO: Major ---
THANK YOU for your letter of July 15, 1968. Your name was given to the Duty Officer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (by telephone) as being a witness to an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation on the night of 5 July 1968. We should have forwarded you the attached form letter, which would have explained that your name was given to us as a witness instead of someone your having reported the observation.

We received many reports on this night-that the night of 5 July that were identified as an aircraft that had an electrical advertising sign attached to it. The plane is a Cessna 172 that operates between 50 to 60 mph and when the sign is lighted, it can be seen as far as 15 miles away. The sign was advertising for Stueve Ford of Miamisburg and was operating in the area of Miamisburg, Franklin, West Carrollton, Kettering and Dayton, on the night of 5 July 1968. We are compiling a report on those observation sightings which were reported to Wright-Patterson on the nights of 5, 6, and 7 July. If-you-did-observe-this-object,-we-would if you did observe something unusual on the night of 5 July, we would appreciate your completing the attached AF Form 117 _______..
