1. Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photograph of an unidentified object on March 24, 1967. Analysis of the photograph showed the image to be generally elliptical in configuration and almost centered on the frame. The image itself appears to be blurred and not in focus, and the photographic image is probably the reflection of an object in the witness's glasses or some other transparent surface. The identities of the actual objects cannot be made from the material and information available.

2. We are returning your photograph. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
