PROJECT BLUE BOOK REPORT
14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? - No, only shifted to the left.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? - Yes (selected)
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? - No (selected)
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: 
a. Sound - distant, fading, whirring
b. Color - circular, glowing, white
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? - About 1/3 the height of the object.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. - The sketch shows a circular or disc-shaped object with a tail or trail, moving in the direction indicated by the arrow.
