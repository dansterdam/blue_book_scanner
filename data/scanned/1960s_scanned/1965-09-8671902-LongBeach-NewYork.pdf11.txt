February 18, 1966
Mrs. Hunt c/s/ SAPOICC/769h/18 Feb 66

Dear Mrs. Hunt,

This letter is a reply to your report of an earth object which became visible to your observation on the night of February 18, 1966.

Your sighting, as one of a characteristic of a satellite overflying the area, was not a satellite of a peculiar operation sighting. According to the data in our files, the eastbound passage of the city of Long Beach was that of a satellite drifting inertly in orbit, carrying out its prescribed functions. There was nothing to indicate that the object sighted was anything other than the normal passage of a satellite, clearly visible to those who may have observed it closely.

We appreciate your observance of the overflight and your desire to cooperate in the Air Force's continuing study of satellite operations. However, we find no basis for the conclusion that the object sighted was anything other than a normal satellite. The attached form indicates the details of our evaluation of your report.
