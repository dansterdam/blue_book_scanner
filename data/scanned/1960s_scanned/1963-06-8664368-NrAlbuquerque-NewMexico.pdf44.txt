Mr. Wm. S. Grysik, UFO Researcher, made a call to IARA member. 
Mr. Grysik stated that on June 20, 1963, at about 9:50 P.M., he and his wife spotted a UFO at about 1000 ft. altitude. The object appeared to be a balloon or a small aircraft. However, Mr. Grysik suggested that it could have been a high flying plane, but he is puzzled by the strange appearance.
