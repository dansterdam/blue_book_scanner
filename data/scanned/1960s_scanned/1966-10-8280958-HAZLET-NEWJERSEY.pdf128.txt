The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. There does not appear to be any photograph present on this page. Instead, the page contains a series of instructions and sketches related to observing and reporting on UFO sightings.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

90° 75° A
60°
45° 
30°
15°
0° B

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
