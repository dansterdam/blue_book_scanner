CLASS IV - SPECIAL REPORT
FACTS OF THE CASE:
ON 8 OCTOBER 1960, CAPT E.J. RUPPELT RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM CAPT. A.A. NEWTON OF LITTLE ROCK AFB, ARKANSAS, REGARDING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTED BY SEVERAL RELIABLE WITNESSES IN THE ARKANSAS AREA.
DETAILS OF SIGHTING.
AT 1947 CST, SEVERAL CITIZENS REPORTED OBSERVING A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE WESTERN SKY. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING IN ONE POSITION FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. IT THEN BEGAN MOVING IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION, ACCELERATING RAPIDLY AND DISAPPEARING FROM SIGHT. THE LIGHT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING EXTREMELY BRIGHT, MUCH BRIGHTER THAN SURROUNDING STARS. IT LEFT NO TRAIL OR EXHAUST VISIBLE TO THE OBSERVERS.
INVESTIGATION
AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION WAS LAUNCHED BY CAPT. NEWTON. HE INTERVIEWED SEVERAL OF THE WITNESSES, ALL OF WHOM GAVE CONSISTENT ACCOUNTS OF THE SIGHTING. THE WITNESSES WERE DEEMED TO BE RELIABLE AND CREDIBLE. CAPT. NEWTON CONDUCTED BACKGROUND CHECKS ON THE WITNESSES AND FOUND THEM TO BE UPSTANDING MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WITH NO KNOWN TENDENCIES TOWARD FABRICATION OR EXAGGERATION. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, WITH EXCELLENT VISIBILITY.
CONCLUSION
BASED ON THE CONSISTENT WITNESS ACCOUNTS AND THE CREDIBILITY OF THE OBSERVERS, CAPT. NEWTON CONCLUDED THAT THE SIGHTING WAS OF A GENUINE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. HE REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO CAPT. RUPPELT AT PROJECT BLUE BOOK FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS.
