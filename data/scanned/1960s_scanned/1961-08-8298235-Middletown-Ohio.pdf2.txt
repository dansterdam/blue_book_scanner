38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it? 
The object is difficult to explain and know for sure what it was. It seems likely it was some type of aircraft or craft, possibly with an experimental or unusual design. The brightness and speed suggest advanced technology. It is possible it could be a natural phenomenon, but the maneuverability and details observed point more to an artificial aerial object.
