The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, with a form-like layout. The text on the page includes the questions "34. Date you completed this questionnaire:" and "35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting." The rest of the page is blank.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 15 Apr 1965
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
