8 December 1967

Mr. Raymond E. Fowler
NICAP Massachusetts Investigation Subcommittee 
13 Friend Court
Wenham, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Fowler:

Dr. Craig has asked me to write you a letter that explains the relationship between the Massachusetts Subcommittee and the UFO Project Colorado. I am glad to do this.

As you point out in your information sheet, NICAP has been cooperating closely with the Colorado group in its scientific study of unidentified flying objects. NICAP headquarters in Washington has provided duplicates of some of the Colorado group's material, and they have kept the Colorado group informed of current sightings. This last function is a very important one, for the Colorado group is part of a national information network, which serves as the cornerstone of our program to develop a communication system that will give us news of sightings soon enough for us to get out into the field before the trail gets cold and the witnesses scattered.

While the relationship between your subcommittee and our project is informal, and there is no direct administrative connection, nevertheless the work you are doing is of great importance to the success of our investigation of the UFO problem, whether in the government or outside, to cooperate with you in every way possible. If it is certainly true that anyone who helps you is, indirectly, helping us. Our work, in turn, which is being done with regard to funds, was authorized in response to a widely-expressed public need for a careful review of the entire UFO problem.

Feel free to show this letter to anyone you wish. 

Sincerely yours,

Project Coordinator
UFO Study
