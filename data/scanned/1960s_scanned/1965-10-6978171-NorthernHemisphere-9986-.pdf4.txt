The image appears to be a photograph from a Project Blue Book document. It shows a night sky with a bright object or light source illuminating the skyline and surrounding buildings. The image has a grainy, black and white appearance that is characteristic of older photographic materials.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969. This photograph seems to depict a UFO-related incident that was likely reported and documented as part of the Project Blue Book investigations.
