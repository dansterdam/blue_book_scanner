JACKSONVILLE, FLA., APRIL 22 0?): JACKSONVILLE RESIDENTS WHO SAID THEY OBSERVED THE GHOST OF A MAN, DRESSED IN WHITE AND TOPPED BY A WHITE CLOUD, NEAR MURRAY HILL WERE SO IMPRESSED BY THE EXPERIENCE THAT THEY CALLED TO ADULTS WHO SAID THEY'VE SEEN GHOSTS BEFORE.

CHURCH OFFICIALS CALLED SO MUCH THAT LAST NIGHT THE MINISTER OF A NEARBY CHURCH COULD NOT QUIET THE POLICE UNTIL HE PROMISED TO ATTEMPT A SPECIAL SERVICE. OFFICIALS SAID THE WITNESSES WERE OBVIOUSLY SINCERE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT. POLICE COULD NOT CONFIRM THIS EXPLANATION, BUT THERE WERE HINTS THEY PLAN TO CHECK IT OUT IN SOME LEISURE HOURS.
