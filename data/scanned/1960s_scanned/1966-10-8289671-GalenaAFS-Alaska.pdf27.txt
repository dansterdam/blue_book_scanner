Proposed reply to a letter from [redacted] 29 Oct 66
Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your letter of October 29, 1966 regarding a glowing object sighted over Long Island on October 22 is appreciated. It is most helpful in our evaluations when persons, such as yourself, report an unusual observation and offer a possible explanation to its cause or causes.

There have been several alleged UFO sightings in the Long Island area of late. We do have one observation, which occurred on October 22 at 2000 hours, local time, which does fit the description you provided. Other similar observations have been reported of a star-like object observed in the western sky. However, we feel that the star Arcturus is responsible for these sightings.

Did you and the other crew members observe a very bright star in addition to your reported observation? Arcturus would have been setting on an azimuth of 200 degrees at 2000 hours EDT.

If you can remember the exact data on your sighting and if your crew did observe Arcturus in addition to the unidentified it would be most helpful.

Thank you for your informative letter and we hope to hear from you soon.
