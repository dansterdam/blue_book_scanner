The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a set of diagrams and instructions. The diagrams appear to be related to the movement or trajectory of an object, as they include sketches of curved lines and a radial compass-like dial.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "X" at the point where the object disappeared.

28. Draw a picture that will show the position of the object. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
