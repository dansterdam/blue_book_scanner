18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known size object. If you had performed this sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
About 3/4 to 1 inch of the match head

I had not seen it move in any fixed direction it appeared to float or hover in a rather desultory manner I draw it approximately like a large brilliant yellow/white head of match cover about 15 feet in diameter with faint red vaporous extremities that seemed constantly changing in size. There seems to have been almost every night.
