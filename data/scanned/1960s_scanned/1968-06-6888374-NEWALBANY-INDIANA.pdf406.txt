The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a handwritten letter describing the witness's experience of seeing an unidentified object. The letter mentions that the witness was laying in bed when they noticed the object through the window, which was circular and had a glowing disk shape. The witness called their brother, who also witnessed the object. The letter states that the witness will include a drawing of the object.

Text from the document:

Dear Sirs:
Six days ago when I was laying in bed I became restless. So I rolled over and looked at my window. I was watching the sky. A peculiar distortion was attracting my attention. All of a sudden it became clear to a bright disk shaped object glowing from the center. As I called my brother to come and see it we watched a strange kind of electrical station. It moved closely toward the object. As the object left the end of the disc shped light. It had turned off its bright. We had tried to send what we saw. The time that I saw the clock to 10:15 P.M.

Sincerely,

P.S. I WILL INCLOSE DRAWING OF OBJECT
