The image contains a photograph of an inflatable spacecraft or structure. The image shows a large, curved spacecraft-like object with a central hub and spokes extending outwards. The text describes this as an "inflatable structure in space" and provides details about its deployment and capabilities.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE

Here a ballistic-type nose for the center hub and, as brought out in some of the earlier discussion, the space station would be packaged within the nose cone as an integral unit. After deployment of the inflated section in the space environment, the crew could move out through the spokes into the working structure. As you can see, in the lower left-hand side, completely packaged, the inflatable components make closely with the booster configuration. After deployment, the pressurized space station assumes the toroidal shape. Following the expansion of the mission, the capsule can be separated similarly to the manner in which it recently accomplished with the Mercury capsule.
Figure 13 shows the launch configuration, which is perhaps better described by a movie which we can show now of the building of an expandable/contractible space station model and deployed configurations. Starting with the basic Atlas booster, as shown here, then comes an interstage fairing, the attachment of the Centaur stage, and finally on top of this the mission module, as we term it, which would enclose the packaged inflatable space station. This is attached to the Mercury capsule configuration much as it is presently designed today.
