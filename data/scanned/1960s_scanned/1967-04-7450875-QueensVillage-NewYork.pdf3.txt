There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document with text describing a sighting or observation of some kind.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

and higher and higher the object came to be seen. The line of motion was straight up. The object seemed to be moving at a very high speed, I'm sure, the sighting spread over an interval of no more than 90 seconds. The lights at the bottom of it seemed very highly illuminated, and I would see the shape and exact have many lights it had. The triangular shape thing came more plainly to sight as it moved higher and higher. The lights at the bottom of it were of a twinkling nature, sometimes seemed to be steady however, and I'll describe them as of orangish cast.
My brother and I followed it. This time the color changed from orange to red. Two came to an upper flame. Again the color changed from red to white, and it started moving.
"Now don't tell me I saw a plane. some other explanation is needed, though this is unusual, I know a U.F.O. when I see one.

(P.S. I am sending you a drawing of what I saw again which may help light some points.)
