Dr. L. Delbouille
Universite de Liege

BELGIUM

Dear Dr. Delbouille:

Many thanks for your letter of July 29th, which has been received while Dr. Roberts was from the office. It will be happy to see it together with the one from Dr. Miesotte, when he returns toward the end of the month.

Meanwhile, I have sent your letter and enclosures on to Dr. Daniel Fuente, Director of the Facilities Division. The decision as to the scheduling of your experiment will be in hands, so I'm sure you will be hearing from Dr. Rex or one of his colleagues directly.

With best wishes.
Sincerely,

Stanley Buttenberg
Assistant to Dr. Roberts
