The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document. The page appears to be filled out with handwritten responses to various questions related to the observation of an unidentified object.

Here is the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
No, it didn't.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know If you answered YES, then tell what 
it moved behind: A cloud or more than one cloud. It disappeared behind the cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know If you answered YES, then tell what 
it moved in front of: It seemed to emerge from a corner of a cloud.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound no sound at all
b. Color all the colors mixed yellowish white haze

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and mark, how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
One match length would have just about covered the object.

19. Do we have a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc. and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails, place an outline to show the direction the object was moving.
The object was a spherical shape, about the size of a basketball, pale yellowish white in color. It seemed to emerge from a cloud, hover, and then disappear back into the cloud. No exhaust trails or other detailed features were observed.
