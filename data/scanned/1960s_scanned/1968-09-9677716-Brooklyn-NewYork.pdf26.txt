Subject: Unidentified Flying Object Observation

Gentlemen:

I am enclosing the observations of my wife, two of my sons and myself, of a sighting of an unidentified object which we saw last night, September 9, 1968.

My son, on his way home from work, first saw the object and gives the most information on its actions. He was on the second floor of our house, looking out of a window facing the east.

I next saw the object, independently, through a door on the first floor, also facing east. My alert to the rest of the family and my wife and second son soon joined me to see the final minute or so.

We each wrote down our observations before any discussions, in order to obtain as unbiased data as possible, and I have included those writings on this enclosed sheet.

If we can be of any further help in describing this occurrence, we will be glad to do so.

Yours very truly,
