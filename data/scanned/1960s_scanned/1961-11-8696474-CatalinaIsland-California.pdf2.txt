Lt. DCAS FT officer, telephoned in a report of an object observed by parachute on Santa Catalina Island. Descriptive info is sketched on attachments: action taken is represented by FID message 11-11-207 prior to which I called TD-E (Major Friend) as above at 9:45 PM 11 nov. Office of SAFLD (Ha) Friend was not at home. I attempted to reach others of TICO units one of which was "USAF CXFF GENGP CORP." indicating that action was not of foreign techonology concern. Hopefully, by Monday AM, its progress will have turned up. I tried not to dampen Lt's enthusiasm for recovering objects that fell after all, the comrade Molotov.
