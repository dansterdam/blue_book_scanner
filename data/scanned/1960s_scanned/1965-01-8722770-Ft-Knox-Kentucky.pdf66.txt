10-Year-Old
Reports Seeing
Flying Saucer
Corbin, Kentucky. - A 10-
year-old boy here, Hartford
Lassiter, said he saw a flying
saucer hovering over his home
Saturday night and watched it
for 15 minutes before it dis-
appeared. 
He said it was about the size
of a five-gallon bucket, was made
of "bright, shiny metal" and
floated about 20 feet above the
ground. 
The attention was attracted
to the scene by his mother and
seven-year-old sister, who also
saw the object.
"He said he could look in the
object and see something like
a man in the window, but could
not make out what it was."
Last July 16 he saw a similar
object that disappeared after
about 20 minutes, the boy report-
ed. 
The lad, his mother and sister
are all said to be highly respect-
ed in this area. The story has
caused quite a stir and some per-
sons are inclined to believe the
boy's story.
"It's his favorite subject and
it's a favorite with his schoolmates.
They like to discuss it," said his
mother.
