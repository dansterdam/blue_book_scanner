The image contains a sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch depicts an instruction or questionnaire for observers to fill out regarding their sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). It contains a horizon line with markings indicating the altitude of the observed object, as well as a compass-like diagram for indicating the direction of the object. There are also instructions for the observer to draw the motion and direction of the observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
