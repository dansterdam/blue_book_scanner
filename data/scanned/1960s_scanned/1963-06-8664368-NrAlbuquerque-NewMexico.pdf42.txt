Dear Sir:

I would like to tell you of an experience which is rather interesting. On the night of June 4, 1963 at about 10:00 pm, as I was in my back yard, I saw a light silver, or a light aluminum color object which seemed to be about 25 or 35 feet in diameter. It was descending at about a 35 degree angle and moving at an estimated speed of about 35 mph. As it approached from the N.E. it described a semi-circular course and disappeared behind some trees. It was descending at too extreme of an angle as it approached from the N.E. to disappearance.
