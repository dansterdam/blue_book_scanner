17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound None

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing any outstanding features, such as wings, portholes, etc, and especially show trails or attachments to the object. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
