This image does not contain any photograph or visual representation. It appears to be a handwritten document or report, likely from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

"On the night of Nov. 6, 1969 I was awakened by a bright light illuminating the hilly countryside southwest of my home, about 15 miles southwest of Twin Falls, Idaho. This light, or "craft", as it appeared to be, seemed to be hovering or resting on the ground. It remained stationary for at least 11 minutes.

Some time after this aircraft, or whatever it was, began moving very slowly in a westerly direction. It was a brilliantly lighted, oval-shaped object. When it began moving, it moved upwards slightly, then slowly moved westward with a very slight swaying motion, almost like a pendulum. It moved very slowly, seemed to be about 25-30 feet above the ground, and disappeared behind a hill about a mile distant.

The night was clear, and I had an unobstructed view of the phenomenon. Its size, from where I observed it, appeared to be about 35-40 feet in diameter. It illuminated a wide area around it, and the countryside was quite bright while it remained there. After it moved out of sight, all was dark again. I've never seen anything like this before, and I'm quite sure there is no logical, earthly explanation for what I observed. The experience has left me rather shaken. There was no sound at all."
