The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically a chapter on "USAF High Altitude Refueling Areas" as indicated by the chapter heading.

CHAPTER 1
USAF HIGH ALTITUDE REFUELING AREAS

1. Purpose:
This chapter provides information and operations planning data with complete information concerning the high altitude areas, their location, altitude, and other pertinent data.

2. Concept of Operation:
a. Except as specified in the following paragraphs, all SAC high altitude refueling operations will be conducted in the published high altitude refueling areas. 
b. The refueling areas are established by SAC for the purpose of providing a scheduled refueling capability at high altitudes for all aircraft assigned to SAC.
c. Aircraft other than SAC aircraft will not be cleared for refueling in these areas except on a special mission basis. This will be considered only when the refueling aircraft and the receiver aircraft are scheduled for refueling at the same time and do not interfere with the planned SAC refueling operations.
d. All aircraft involved in refueling operations will provide their own separation visually.

3. The following procedures have been established to warn VFR and VFR-en-route traffic of all refueling operations:
(1) The description of the high altitude refueling areas published in the Airman's Guide and USAF Aeronautical Publications.
(2) NAVAID Flight Service Stations include in scheduled broadcasts the fact that air refueling is being conducted in specified areas.
(3) FAA flight service stations issue flight advisory information to VFR traffic known to be operating in the vicinity of scheduled refueling areas.
c. It is recognized that certain essential training and tactical requirements such as large scale navigation and tactics requires certain deviations from the established areas.
