AFxTR CONTROL FOR INVESTIGATION OF CONTACTS. A COMBINATION OF METRIC
TRACKING AND SURVEILLANCE RADARS WERE USED FOR AIRCRAFT VECTORING AND
INTERCEPT. EACH FLIGHT WAS VECTORED TO NUMEROUS STRONG RADAR TARGETS.
RADAR CONTACT WAS REPORTED SEVERAL TIMES BY THE AIRCRAFT, HOWEVER
TARGETS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SCOPE WHEN APPROACHING AT CLOSE RANGE.
VISUAL REPORT WAS CALLED FROM THE AIRCRAFT OF FLIGHT NUMBER 2, BUT WAS LOST ON CLOSING. SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS TO REACQUIRE WERE NEGATIVE.
