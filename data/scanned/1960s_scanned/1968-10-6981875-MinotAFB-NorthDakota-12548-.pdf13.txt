NARRATIVE REPORT: On 6 Oct 68, at 1730 hrs, a B-52 bomber from
Minot AFB, North Dakota, piloted by capt. Raymond E. Odom, was
observed by the B-52 crew to have a single bright light in the
northern sky following the aircraft. The light was observed to
move in an erratic fashion, going from a stationary position to a
fast-paced, angular movement, and then back to a stationary position.
At times, the light appeared to "home in" on the aircraft, coming
closer and then moving away. The light source was white in color
and did not appear to pulse or change color. The light source
appeared to be spherical in shape. The observation lasted for
approximately 20 minutes.
