The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a UFO or an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The sketch depicts an oval-shaped object with a raised middle section. There is text surrounding the sketch, which I will extract and provide below.

"Sear sir: -I am writing to you because I have some data. Can you please examine this material and let me know what you think. The witness is a reliable person who has observed these things before. He said the object was hovering over the trees and was a bluish-white color. It was about 30 to 60 feet in diameter. Please let me know if you need any additional information. Thank you for your attention in this matter.
Sincerely,"
