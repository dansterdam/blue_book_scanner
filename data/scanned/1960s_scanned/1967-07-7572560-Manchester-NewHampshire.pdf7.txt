TYPED COMMENTS MADE BY DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK ON JUNE 1968
MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE 25 JULY 1967
Another single witness case. The present "possible aircraft" evaluation is not in line with the report unless we say the report is grossly in error.
Report does not indicate tangential motion. He described appearance as bright red. There was no sound, but object was in sight only 1Â½ minutes. His "A" and "B" on page 5 of his report are identical and not moving--except away from observer.
A detailed follow-up would have been needed to properly evaluate this sighting. Soc "tangible aircraft" is possible unidentified.
