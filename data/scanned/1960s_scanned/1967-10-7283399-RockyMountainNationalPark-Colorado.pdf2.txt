Mass Turnure/SAP-OTC/75526/Oct 19, 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This will reply to your letter of October 11, to the Secretary of Defense, with regards to your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without technical information, it is difficult at this time to offer an explanation as to what you saw. Your letter and the attached questionnaire are now in the inclosed project-file envelope to the address given to me. We will determine if we will recommend a reply.

In the future, should you sight another UFO, please report it immediately to the UFO Investigator at the nearest Air Force Base. Reporting these sightings is actually a very important matter, as they may have become busy in the future.

We hope that the included material will be of interest in your further understanding of these objects. Thank you for your interest in our UFO program.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
