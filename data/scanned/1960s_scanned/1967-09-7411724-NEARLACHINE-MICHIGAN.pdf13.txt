SEW ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THIS FORM: PART 1
(1) THE FIRST THING THAT CAUGHT OUR EYE WAS A DISTINCT GLOWING LIGHT, VERY BRIGHT AND APPEARED TO BE A SOLID METALLIC MASS.
(2) PASSING EXTREMELY CLOSE TO US, WE FEEL THAT IT HIT THE OBJET WITH A LIGHT BEAM OR SOMETHING AS THE LIGHT SEEMED TO PASS COMPLETELY OUT OF SIGHT FROM US WITH OUR EYES. EACH TIME IT DID THIS, IT TOOK ONE OR TWO SECONDS.
(3) THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE SURROUNDED BY A HALO OF LIGHT, ALMOST LIKE THE GLOW FROM MOLTEN METAL. THIS LIGHT WAS NOT CONTAINED BUT RATHER SEEMED TO BE EMITTED FROM THE OBJECT.
(4) AS THE OBJECT NEARED US, THE LIGHT COMING FROM IT SEEMED TO FLUCTUATE CONSTANTLY AND IN IRREGULAR INTERVALS. IT WAS NOT STEADY BUT RATHER VARIABLE IN ITS INTENSITY.
(5) AT ITS FARTHEST POINT, A STEADY HEAD - WOULD HAVE COVERED THE COMPLETE OBJECT. HOWEVER, AT ITS CLOSEST POINT, IT WOULD ONLY COVER A VERY MINUTE PORTION.

DURING THE ENTIRE OBSERVATION, THERE WAS NO SOUND WHATSOEVER FROM THE OBJECT. THERE APPEARED TO BE NO WINGS, TAIL OR APPENDAGES PROTRUDING FROM IT. IT SEEMED COMPLETELY ROUND OR SPHERICAL IN SHAPE. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO INDICATION IF IT WAS COMING FROM OR GOING TO ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION, AS IT MOVED FROM POINT TO POINT IN A SEEMINGLY RANDOM FASHION.
