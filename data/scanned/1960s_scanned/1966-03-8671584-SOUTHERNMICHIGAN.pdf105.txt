UFO Manifestation
On Rise Since July
Continued From Page A-4
views: It has been a big year for
sightings of unidentified flying
objects, according to Col. J.L.
Nicholson, head of Project Blue
Book, the Air Force's official UFO-
reporting agency. He said 11.1-1r0
reported seeing 4 large, oval-
shaped lights in the sky near
Wekiwa Springs, Fla., that were
visible for several minutes before
disappearing into the "pot holes."
The glowing objects rose rapidly
to a height of between 15,000 and
20,000 feet and were "monstrously
large" before disappearing into
the distance. The sightings were
World Events Going On
According to Hall, the British
Ministry of Aviation received 76
reports of "flying saucer" sightings
from northern Texas and Okla-
reported to the Air Force by the
Seminole County, Fla., Sheriff's
Office.
March 13—La Porte, Ind.—Three
individuals reported seeing an
object about the size of a car that
hovered over trees for about 10
minutes before disappearing.
March 3—Dearborn, Mich.—
Michigan police sighted an oval-
shaped object that hovered over a
freeway and then sped away when
they tried to pursue it. The
object was estimated to be about
150 feet long, according to reports.
March 3—Livonia, Mich.—Several
witnesses reported seeing an
object in the sky near I.nivs
hospital. The witnesses were a
pharmacist and a florist from the
area and they described the ob-
ject as bright blue-green in color.
Defense Director Confirms
March 3—Hillsdale. Mich.—A
Michigan Civil Defense director
confirmed reports of sightings on
this date. He said the objects,
either round or oval, that were
seen for several minutes. Air
Force jets were scrambled from
Wurtsmith AFB to try to intercept
them.
The Air Force summons and
questioned witnesses because
some reports indicated that these
sightings bore similarities to the
UFO sightings discovered by a
NICAF team that investigated 35
separate reports. the Air Force
said ground and aerial searches,
with the aid of NICAP (National
Investigations Committee on
Aerial Phenomena) equipment,
produced no tangible evidence of
the objects.
Hall explained, the La Porte
incident, for example, occurred
two days after the Livonia sighting,
and it involved a trio of lights
referred to as unidentified.
"Project Blue Book does not have
a record of that case."
Hall said the recent reports
showed that somewhere between
5,000 and 15,000 sightings have
been made by the armed forces
since 1948, when the Air Force
began collecting information on
UFO sightings.
Hall said that of the sightings
made, about 5,000 were "first-hand"
observations involving pilots
who saw unidentified objects while
in flight. He said the armed forces
have another 10,000 "indirect"
observations or reports of objects
seen by ground observers, making
a totel of about 15,000.
"But this 15,000 total," Hall
explained, "represents about 1,500
a year or 125 a month since
1948. And the sightings continue
unabated."
Hall said this lack of tangible
evidence after so many sightings
reported is pretty much the
same all over the universe.
He said the greatest problem
with the new UFO activity is in
reconciling the reports.
"There has never been any
scientific or law enforcement proof
of the existence of UFO''s," Hall
said. "What we have are many,
many unidentified reports that so
far have withstood all attempts at
resolution."
Hall said serious students of
the UFO mystery, both within the
government and outside, have
become leery of the some of the
wilder claims and allegations that
are made in connection with these
sightings.
"To date, no verified physical
evidence of a UFO—if such evi-
dence has existed—has ever been
recovered," Hall pointed out.
"The few times something seems
tangible, it turns out to be some
quite natural or conventional ex-
planation."
