Transcription of the text in the document:

I realize that there is a background of a rather technical nature to this from whatever has precipitated it: but I believe that there is a matter here which should be looked into without delay if at all possible. I cannot avoid a rather special interest which I have gained because of certain arrangements which I have been able to effect and I would like very much to know what can be done.

I hope I do not seem of some wrong contact here and please let me know what the situation is. It seems that there may be some chance for a change. Very truly yours,
