REPORT BY TELEPHONE CONVERSATION 15 APRIL 1966
SHERIFF SPAUR, RAVENNA, OHIO.
0505 WHEN I GOT BACK FROM MY CRUISER, I WAS CHECKING AN ABANDONED VEHICLE ON 22, VERY BRIGHT LIGHT, FIRST ATTRACTED
FROM WEST IN AN EASTERN DIRECTION, PASSED OVER US TO THE NORTH
SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. I BELIEVE THERE WAS A PARTIAL MOON DUE EAST
OF US. THERE WAS ONE OTHER OBJECT LIKE A STAR, RIGHT OF THE MOON
ON SOUTH OF MOON. THE ONLY SHAPE WAS THE ROUNDNESS OF IT, IMPERFECT
CIRCLE, EGG SHAPED, ALMOST LIKE OBLONG, BUT NO REAL OBLONG. SO BRIGHT
THAT WE COULDN'T LOOK DIRECTLY AT IT. CAME OUT OF A DEEP WOODED AREA.
CAME FROM THE WEST TOWARDS US. WE JUST DISREGARDED IT AT FIRST. JUST
A ROUTINE PATROL. PARTNER ALSO OBSERVED IT. HE WAS TO THE RIGHT OF THE
CAR. THOUGHT SOMEONE MIGHT COME MYSTIC OUT OF THE WOODS WANTED TO MAKE
SURE NO ONE WAS WALKING BEHIND US. VERY LOW ON THE HORIZON. THEOBJECT
CAR WAS WATCHING IT FROM TWO ROADS ABOVE IT. IT WAS NOT MORE THAN 150
FEET OVER THE ONE AREA. DIDN'T HAVE A RED LIGHT. NO WIND.WHEN IT CAME
OVER US IT LIGHTED THE WHOLE AREA. THE GROUND WAS LIGHTED BY THIS OBJECT.
LIKE LOOKING AT SUNLIGHT, BLUE-WHITE LIGHT. THE ONLY SOUND HEARD WAS A
HUMMING SOUND LIKE A POWER TRANSFORMER. NO THRUST LIKE FROM A JET. NO
SUDDEN SURGE OF POWER. ANGLED SLIGHTLY, BOTTOM CENTER ACROSS 22, ON
THE SOUTH SIDE OF ROAD, STARTED GOING EAST. SLOW MOVEMENT. WE RAN BACK
AND HAD A CAMERA. KEPT UNDER SURVEILLANCE TILL IT COULD BE POSSIBLY
PHOTOGRAPHED. THOSE WERE OUR INSTRUCTIONS AFTER WE HAD CALLED IN. THE
MANTUA POLICE HAD PHOTOGRAPHED THE OBJECT. WE HAVE A COPY FROM MANTUA.
