Sirs:
I wish to report the sighting of an UFO over this city at 8:10 P.M. on the 7th of this month, August. See attached sketch.

One typical disc shaped object was observed at 8:10 PM and was observed for 3 minutes and 20 seconds. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and illuminated by a light source. It did not appear to make any sound. The object was observed by two other observers in addition to myself. However, these are on record and if it becomes necessary I shall provide you with their names.

In the last six months several unidentified flying objects have been reported in this area. The observers would not identify their names so I will not report them to you. They would not vouch for that kind of sightings.

Further reports: Due to the brilliant attitude, make it most difficult to obtain reliable data on any UFO sighted anywhere. The physical appearance and motions of these objects or phenomenon defy rationalization according to present technical knowledge or scientific concepts. I have even been told by some reliable observers that these craft have been seen to dispel particles of light or fire as they pass through the atmosphere. Will you please send me your latest summary of unidentified flying objects?

Yours sincerely,

P.S: I enclose tear sheets of UFO sightings over Richardson, Texas, 20 miles south of this place, though you doubtless already have this into. Heff.
