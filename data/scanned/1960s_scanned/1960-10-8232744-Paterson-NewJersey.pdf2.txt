Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system:

Rounded around the horizon by some light
Strange to find the line of light across the sky at about 10:03 pm just low enough to see it clearly as light almost like a fluorescent tube just running across the sky, about 30 yards across, a sort of steady glow not flickering. Lasted about 10 minutes. No sound. Seemed to be slowly descending to the horizon. Thought at first it might be a plane, but no flashing lights or any sign of an aircraft. Moved smoothly and slowly. Seemed about 10 miles away.
Later, about 10:15 pm, saw another light, high in the sky, moving rapidly, steady, bright light, seemed to move from the northeast to the southwest, then disappear. Don't know what it was.
About 10:30 pm, saw a third light, high in the sky, moving steadily, not as rapidly as the second one, also from northeast to southwest. This one seemed to wink out rather than disappear.
Could not tell the size, distance or altitude of any of these. Just saw the lights.
Would appreciate any information you can give me as to what these might have been. Very strange and interesting sights.
