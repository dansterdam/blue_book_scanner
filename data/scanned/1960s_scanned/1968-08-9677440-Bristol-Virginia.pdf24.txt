The image contains two sketches or illustrations. The larger sketch on the left appears to be a compass rose, with directions labeled around the circumference. The text above the compass rose instructs the viewer to "PLACE AN 'X' ON THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A '?' AT THE LOCATION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT."

The smaller sketch on the right appears to be a landscape scene, with a figure standing in the foreground and mountains or hills in the background.
