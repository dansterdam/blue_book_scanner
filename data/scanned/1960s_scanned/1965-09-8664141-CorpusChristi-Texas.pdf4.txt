The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a sketch and text instructions.

The text found in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve where you last saw the object above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
