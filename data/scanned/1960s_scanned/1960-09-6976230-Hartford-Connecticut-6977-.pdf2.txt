UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTINGS 
HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT
6 September 1960
ABSTRACT:
On 6 September 1960, at about 8:40 P.M., EST, Mr. and Mrs. X were driving south on Route 5 near Hartford, Connecticut, when they sighted an object in the sky to the east. The object was described as cigar-shaped, glowing with a reddish-orange color, and emitting a bluish-white exhaust trail. The object descended rapidly and was observed for about two minutes before disappearing from sight. No sound was heard. Both observers were seemingly credible and their report was considered reliable.
