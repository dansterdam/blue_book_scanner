These estimated costs are not supported by or obtained from any accounting system. They are based on estimates of personnel time, operational expenses, and certain other costs supplied by the DOD organizations concerned. The costs listed under "Estimated costs" column include estimated cost of range support by Mercury programs. These costs have been furnished to NASA for negotiation and approval by NASA. This is a continuing process as the program develops and as the requirement for DOD support increases. 
Overall coordination of Department of Defense support for Project Mercury operations is maintained between Major Gen. Leighton L. Davis, USAF, Department of Defense Representative for Project Mercury, and Mr. Walter C. Williams, Associate Director of Project Mercury.
