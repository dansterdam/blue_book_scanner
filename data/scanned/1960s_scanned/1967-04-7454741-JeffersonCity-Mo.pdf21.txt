Oh sure. The Highway Patrolman's son.
Now that's funny. 
And I know who did it and one of them was a professor at Lincoln's son, (I caught here at Simonton's here for three years and know most of these kids) and they even told me that they were going to do that. And except this one thing: That was not the night that I saw the thing.
Now that's a nice point. Well, this gives me the information I need because I'm going to be there at Wright Field this Friday and this is one of the cases that they wanted to close out on and I will point out that this is not so easy.
No, it isn't, sir.
I hope that I get a chance to really meet you and this --- - you remarked here that------ a wife makes good coffee!
You're always welcome and if you're ever in this area you're welcome to stay in my home if you wish. I'm sure-----would love to meet you. He's one of the nicest men that you'd ever meet. And he was my botany professor and we got to be very good friends and all are, and even though that's been many years ago now I'm in graduate school, and we're still close friends.
Great! Two other things I want to ask you. First off, when - how many nights before or after the sighting did the garment bag incident occur.
Oh, that was some time before then.
Some time before.
You'd have to know Mr. --- to understand the letter that they received. I don't want to hide anyone down at all, I don't believe in that, but I know --- and --- and unless his heart, he does the best.
