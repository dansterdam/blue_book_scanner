The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

Transcribed text from the document:

15 APRIL 1955

This is my opinion of what I feel of this situation of being led to this information. I should like to ask whether you have any additional information on the case, this matter. To your knowledge, were there any additional reports made up at that time which I have not as yet been informed about. 

I would stress on one point, that the limited information I have is not as yet definitive, in my opinion. The details I have been given so far are indeed sketchy and lacking in specificity. I cannot yet arrive at a conclusion that would be definitive.

Thus, I would appreciate it if you would have a closer look at the additional information which may be on file. If new data has come to light since the original report, then I would be most interested in reviewing it. This could provide the necessary detail to make a more comprehensive assessment.

I hope that you will agree with the need for this additional information. It is my desire to arrive at as complete and accurate an understanding of this incident as possible. Please let me know if you can assist me further in this regard.

Sincerely yours,
