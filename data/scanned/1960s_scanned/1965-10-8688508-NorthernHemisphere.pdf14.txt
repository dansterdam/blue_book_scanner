The text in the document states the following:
"This 45 minute explosure of an object above the Gulf of Aden, Africa was taken by Philip L. Gibson and J. Young at Salalah Airport in Oman on October 16th, 1965, just 25 hours before passing of the lunar eclipse.

The object was observed from the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in the southwestern areas of Oman and Parts of Southern Arabia. The object was easily seen with the naked eye and was reported as a glowing, reddish-orange colored disc which appeared to pulse or glow intermittently. At Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, August Dinsmore Bade observed the object through a 36-inch reflecting telescope and described it as a large black disc moving across the sky.

Just half an hour later, Robert Keith Wallace, an instructor at New Mexico State University, also observed the object in the sky over New Mexico. Approximately 4 to 5 minutes in duration, the object was estimated to be approximately 500 feet in diameter.
