REPORT NO. 6978040
DATE: 2 August 1965
LOCATION: WHITEMAN AFB, MISSOURI
SUMMARY:
1. On 2 August 1965, at approximately 2025 hours, a bright light was observed in the sky by the duty officer (Lt. D) and the duty airman (A1C C) at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. The light was first observed in the northwest and was moving in an easterly direction. It appeared to be approximately 500 to 1000 feet in altitude.
2. The light was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, during which time it appeared to be changing shape, size, and intensity. At one point, the light appeared to split into two separate lights, which then rejoined.
3. The duty officer and airman immediately reported the sighting to the base operations officer, who in turn notified the radar approach control and the commander of the 351st Strategic Missile Wing.
4. Radar approach control was unable to detect any targets in the area corresponding to the reported light. No further investigation was conducted, and the incident was classified as "unidentified."
