1. Following is a summary of UFO activity in the Hawaiian area from 2 August to 5 August 1965. Five UFO's were reported and information regarding them is as follows:

a. On 2 August 0600Z (3/2000 local) a family living in Waikiki beach reported bright lights moving across the sky at high altitudes. The lights appeared to change colors from red to blue. During the observation the telephone conversation with the family indicated the lights to be very bright and maneuverable.

b. On 4 August, 0644Z (3/2044 local) numerous sightings were made of an object which fell from the sky southwest of Oahu. The reports differed on the colors but all agreed it was a bright object which left a brilliant trail behind it. The Honolulu VORTAC said it was bright enough to illuminate the whole sky as it fell. Both pilots believed that it burned out before hitting the water. Observers from scientific areas had reported it had occurred.

2. Investigations revealed that the object finally broke into three pieces before it burned out. The first investigation revealed that it could not have been from U.S. space operations and it is unlikely that it was reentry of any artificial satellite. Tentatively investigators estimate the object was approximately 100 to 150 NM southwest of Oahu at position 19361/159-35F.
