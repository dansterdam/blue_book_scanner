"So many years of the world, how, never, been. and black Reliefs have been found for the bearings where they were not really watched up, when these were discovered. Truly these events is strange and wonderful, to be regarded is not altogether unknown in a serious of events in consideration. 
A second or a more visit of this nature of events, that may be looked forward to a discovery in the near future. 
weather conditions, which could be associated with a manifestation of some form, which could not at this time be explained in any known natural phenomena.
In many areas of the country the conditions have been analyzed and have been found to contain a higher content of certain minerals in the soil, which in the concentration found, indicates the possibility of a magnetic disturbance. It is interesting to speculate whether this higher content of certain minerals is the result of the event rather than the cause. I.e. were they brought from somewhere else into the area to produce the unusual effects noted?
It is even possible to form some idea as the the possible nature of the material involved, which could produce the effects described, from the study of the elements and their peculiar properties. Such elements are known to science which might well produce the effects described, when combined under suitable conditions.
It is believed that with further investigation it may be possible to determine with a reasonable degree of certainty, whether the manifestation of this phenomena is the result of a natural occurrence or whether there is a possibility of a technological means, possibly from an extraterrestrial source, being involved.
On the whole, I f feel that the evidence points to the fact that phenomena does exist which cannot be fully explained by any known scientific theory, and the ultimate origin of the body which produces this phenomena must remain an unsolved mystery. I feel that a great deal more fundamental research is necessary before we can arrive at any definite conclusions."
