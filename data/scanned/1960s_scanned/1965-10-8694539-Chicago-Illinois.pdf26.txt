Bexhill posse
Reader S. P. Farmer (of Row Hill, East Sussex) tells of a sighting by himself and two friends on October 17, 1965.
He and his two friends, who live near Hastings, and was looking out across houses and fields towards the town when, he says, "I first took to be a bright star setting beyond a line of trees. About half a minute later I realized that it was not a star but an object suspended about 500-600 ft in the air. 
The possibility that the object was a planet was eliminated when it remained stationary in approximately the same position, and moving erratically upwards and downwards, for about 15-20 minutes.
Someone then suggested that it could be a light moving up and down, but our reader borrowed some binoculars and observed that the object was distinct and not of aircraft or any other known form of aerial transit, being about 50-60 feet in diameter.
At 6:30 p.m. it simply went out like a light. At that time I went into the house to a fire, and when I came out a few minutes later it had gone.
Not one of us who observed the phenomenon are given to flights of fancy, but we all felt that we had seen something which we just could not explain.
