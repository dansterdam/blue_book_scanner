11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer sighted a spherical, whitish-gray, semi-transparent object which he felt was at too high an altitude for a balloon. The object was observed to change speed and direction without apparent cause. The observer stated that it remained in sight for some time and then suddenly disappeared. He felt that the object presented a puzzle for which he had no physical explanation.
In the observation, the observer described the object in detail and felt that no satisfactory physical explanation could be determined.
