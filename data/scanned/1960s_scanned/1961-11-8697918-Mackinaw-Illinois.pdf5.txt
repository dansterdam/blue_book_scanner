"during refueling operations every light on the plane is on full blast. At the close of our first morning session, before we repaired to the field, I had pointed out this resemblance to Capt. *** and asked whether there were any tanker runs in the area. Capt. *** said that KC-97's one on the way out, but that there were two of them based at O'Hare and that conceivably they might have come down this way. I had pointed out this resemblance to his lights and that both this, and the fact that they had seen it stationary for so long, did not jibe with the tanker interpretation.

Nevertheless, when we returned to the squadron base after our interview with *** and found that *** had been doing some investigating of his own and had found that there was a tanker run called Panla Bear that operated between Indianapolis, Kansas City, Desmoines and Springfield and that the erratic motion on the map may very scene he had been had over Mackinack. It now remains to determine whether on the night of November 30th there was indeed a tanker run in progress.

The case as one might reconstruct it on a tanker hypothesis follows: the tanker was making circular runs of very large radius, as I used to observe in the Columbus area, near Lockborne Air Force Base. This tanker may have seen the boom light, which is reported to be/large,and bright, white lights on one of this wings around the field. On his next swing around, he may have spotted the tanker on a straight line run nearly parallel to his line of sight. From the tanker *** stated that he had seen the small light trailing. This would presumably be the jet on the stern chase, closing in for contact with the boom. The breaking up into several lights could very well arise from the fact that although originally resolved they were lost in the glare of the white light until the plane came close enough so that the angular separation of the lights was sufficient to allow the lights to be visible despite the white lights. This would give the appearance of suddenly having come into view. The noise could be explained by being the composite noise of the reciprocating engines of the KC-97 and the noise of the jet motors. Combined, these two sounds would make identification with any one type of aircraft a bit difficult! There is nothing in the remainder of the flight that would run counter to this interpretation other than the salient fact that no navigation lights were noted by. However, assuming that *** had seen the same plane an hour or so earlier (it was quite close), the rather erratic motions can be explained as the tanker making the circular runs to get in the proper position for the fuel transfer."
