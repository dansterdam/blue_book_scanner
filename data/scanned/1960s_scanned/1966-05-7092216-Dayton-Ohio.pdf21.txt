The image does not contain any photographs, only sketches and diagrams. The image shows a sketch of an object in the sky and a compass rose diagram. The text instructions ask the viewer to place markers on the sketches to indicate the altitude and direction of the object when first sighted, as well as to draw a picture showing the motion of the object. There is also a question asking how many objects were sighted, and the answer "EAST" is written in response.

As an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place on "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

0° 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
