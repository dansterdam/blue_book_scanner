Dear Mr. [REDACTED]

In order to analyze a photograph, it is necessary that we have the original negative and pertinent camera information. If a photograph was enclosed with your report, the report will be returned to you as fully as possible and returned with the negative.

Your interest in Air Force matters is appreciated.
