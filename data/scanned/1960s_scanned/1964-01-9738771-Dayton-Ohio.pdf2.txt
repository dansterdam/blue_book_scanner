The following, extracted from Maj Sullivan's OD Report dated 9 Jan 64, is quoted for your information:

"A Mrs. _ called about a sighting an unidentified object earlier in the week - she said she would call back with pertinent facts but called to do so. The objects were seen either Sunday or Monday night. She lives about 10 miles North of Dayton. The said objects were highly illuminated and appeared to rendezvous."
