Text extracted from the image:

Where a photograph was felt immediately and shown to others to be very bright, red-orange color appeared to be very white looking, like the shape of an inverted pear with a stem-like projection on top. Several witnessed the object on 24 Feb 1967 at about 7:40 p.m. while driving south on the Dayton-Trenton Road in Kettering, Ohio. The object was first seen in the sky, moved rapidly and suddenly disappeared. No sound was heard. The object appeared to be metallic and its movement gave the impression of rapid acceleration. The observer(s) seemed confused and taken by surprise. I interviewed the sighters and checked their reliability. All information given checked out. The sighters seemed sincere and appeared to be normal persons. I am forwarding this report for your consideration. Your comments and evaluation would be appreciated.

Sincerely,
