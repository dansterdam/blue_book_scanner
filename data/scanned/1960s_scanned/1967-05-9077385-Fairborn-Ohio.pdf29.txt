PRESS FOR THE RECORD

On 7 Jan 1968
Called Mrs. regarding her 11 May 1967 sighting. 
Mrs. called the duty officer and stated that she had seen a craft hovering a red light near the horizon for about 15 min. I asked Mrs. if she had continued to observe the object after having reported it, and if so how long had she observed it. Mrs. stated that she has seen numerous UFO's and that she didn't recall this sighting at all. I then read the contents of the report to her to refresh her memory but after I had finished she reported that she had seen so many that she still couldn't remember the sighting.
