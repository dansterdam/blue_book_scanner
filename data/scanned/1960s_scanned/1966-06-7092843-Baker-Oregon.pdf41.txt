There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire form with various questions about sighting a UFO or similar object.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before. If so give date or dates and location.

31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One) Yes No 
31.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One) Yes No
31.2 Please list their names and addresses:

32. Please give the following information about yourself:
