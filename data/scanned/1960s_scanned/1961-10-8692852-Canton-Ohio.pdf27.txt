The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows how the object was observed above the horizon, with a curved line to represent the horizon. The second and third sketches show the observed positions of the object, labeled "A" and "B", and provide guidance on how to complete the larger sketch.

The text in the document reads as follows:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown as "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
