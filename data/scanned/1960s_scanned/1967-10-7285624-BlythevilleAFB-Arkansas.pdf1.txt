11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observers sighted a light that when first observed appeared to be a helicopter. The object then proceeded in a straight line for a few seconds and then faded from view. The radar operator felt the object was no more than 3 to 4 minutes in duration. The high speed and irregular course of the object indicated to the observers it was a target moving 600-800 MPH due south.
COMMENTS: Radar operator felt he was painting automobile and not a UCR. Three different radar blips tracked rapidly. These pieces traveled approximately 35 seconds.
