MAY 3 5 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference: your recent letter reporting your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of 15 May 67.

At this late date, it would be extremely difficult to make a comprehensive evaluation of the sighting. It is most important that we receive the reports at the earliest possible date.

The only possible explanation that I can give is that the sighting has the characteristics of an aircraft refueling mission. Such refueling operations have been responsible for numerous UFO reports.

Enclosed is the report on Project Blue Book which you requested. Your interest in our program is appreciated.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.
