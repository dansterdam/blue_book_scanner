The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object. The sketch is accompanied by text on the page, which appears to be part of a questionnaire or report related to the sighting of the object.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? These were accelerated to the air swiftly and the speed was tremendous.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: It appeared to follow the white of the clouds.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what: 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: The strange sound sounded like an aerial roar
b. Color: Shining bright, fast changing colors that flashed green, orange, blue, silver, and white

18. Was the object's distance and size estimated? If so, please give your estimate: Impossible to determine exact size, but quite small in relation to the speed and maneuvers. I would estimate it may have been 30 to 40 feet in diameter.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object (no you saw) such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The hand-drawn sketch in the image depicts an elongated, egg-shaped UFO object.
