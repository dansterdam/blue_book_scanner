The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with text describing the movement of vertical clouds and other observations.

MOVEMENT OF VERTICAL CLOUDS - As shown for the period of 19:42 GMT 1 Aug 63 to 20:22 GMT 1 Aug 63, approximately 40 minutes after the sighting time of two blue lights observed by USAF personnel at Southampton, N. Y. The clouds showed larger variations in density and altitude, from about 8,000 feet down to 5,000 feet, compared to the normal variations of about 1,000 feet observed during the period. This high compliance with their frequencies is about 1 to 10 cycles per minute. The precise reason for this behavior of the clouds is not known, but the passage of the objects through the air may have been responsible for generating the clouds at higher levels.
