Dear Blue Band,

My name is Raymond Reber. I called you at 7:55 on Saturday morning, November 26, 1966. Because the siting which I reported appeared to be important, I wanted to provide some more details.

The sited object appeared to be oval-shaped and silvery in color. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed and silently. The object was first sighted at about 7:50 AM. It seemed to approach from the east and then disappeared towards the southwest. I would estimate the size of the object to be approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. While I was watching, the object suddenly changed direction and accelerated away at a very high rate of speed.

I think this sighting is worthy of investigation. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
Raymond Reber
