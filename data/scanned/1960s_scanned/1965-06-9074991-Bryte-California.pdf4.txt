There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document containing handwritten text.

Transcribed text from the document:

We were walking down the street (a very hilly street) we stopped to look at a bird that had been run over. Just as I bent down, I noticed something in the southern sky. It had a faint disc shape of white and I looked at it from the peripheral it had a very faint silhouette close shape, but very dim. As soon as I bent down the glare became very bright, so bright that I couldn't see the sky anymore. Then it changed to deep green and then to dim gold. Then it became very bright again and then it went below the horizon. And I followed, repeating the same motion. I just saw the same motion at the time.
