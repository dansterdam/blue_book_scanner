My saan about aircraft, the huge light moving past and disapppearing into the distance. We watched the object for several minutes. It seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed, far above the altitude of commercial aircraft. The object and continued on out of sight. I was startled by the brightness of the light and the speed at which the object was traveling. It did not resemble any type of known aircraft. The object remained in sight for a few minutes and then disappeared from view. I watched it carefully and I am convinced that this was not a conventional aircraft.
