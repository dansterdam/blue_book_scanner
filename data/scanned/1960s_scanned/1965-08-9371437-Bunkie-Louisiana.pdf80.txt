The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page contains a questionnaire form with questions related to a UFO sighting. The text in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 27 9 1965
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
