Dear Sir,
Way report - night - could see in sky forms moved around the room - my wife noticed them - they did not dash or fly - just moved around very slow and stayed low - they were almost a round form and seemed to remain the same size - they came and went from sight - my wife observed them as well as I - I filled out the report form - enclosed one copy for your files.
Sincerely,
