Dear _____,

This will reply to your recent correspondence on an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without essential information, such as detailed flight characteristics, physical descriptions, and other information we use for a comprehensive investigation, we are unable to identify the object in question. Had you contacted us at the time the observation was made, we could have undertaken a more thorough investigation.

The included information on Project Blue Book may be of interest to you. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

DARNELL R. YOUNG
