Dear Captain Hinden,

Office is investigation of siad unknown and lighted
object sighted the morning of June 4 around and just at the point it
turns light in the morning. It was a little strange as it seemed
to move. It was brighter than the stars and not light in the
constellation on it was noticed it appeared to be moving in a straight
line formation and the movement was very slow and seemed to be mantaining
the straight line formation. The bright shining light and steady and
looked like a star was not like. Occasionally a slight
variation in brightness, the re-appearance on the lower
left side was cleared bright but seemed slightly smaller than the first
sighting. That is about all the information I can obtain at this time. 
There were no other reports of sightings in this area on that morning that
I know of so far.
