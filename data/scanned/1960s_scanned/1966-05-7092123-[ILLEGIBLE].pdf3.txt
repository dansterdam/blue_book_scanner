The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

The text from the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 23 March 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The night of March 9, 1966, while the object was hovering over our house, the lights in the house went off and the television set went off and on several times. The object was almost directly over us, and we could see lights on the underside of the object. The lights were very bright and seemed to be rotating. The object seemed to be almost circular in shape and as large as a house. The night was clear and we could see the object very plainly. We observed the object for about 10 minutes before it moved away in a Northeasterly direction and disappeared from view. We called the police station at Mena, Arkansas, but they said they had received no other reports of the object. We are sure this was not an airplane or helicopter, and it was not the moon or a star. The sighting was very unusual and we would be glad to answer any further questions you may have.
