The image appears to show a series of three similar silhouette figures in motion, captured in a sequence of three frames. The figures appear to be leaping or jumping, with their arms extended outward. The image is grainy and appears to be a photographic reproduction or a scan of an older document.

SIGHTING REPORT

On June 7, 1960, at approximately 9:30 P.M., Mrs. Rhea Schrader, residing at 911 N. Elm St., Champaign, Illinois, reported that she had observed several UFO's in the sky over Champaign.

Mrs. Schrader stated that she first noticed a single bright light in the western sky. This light, she said, was followed shortly afterward by two more bright lights, all of which were maneuvering in a very unusual manner. 

Mrs. Schrader described the objects as being round in shape and emitting a brilliant white light. She said that the objects seemed to dart back and forth across the sky at high speeds, then would suddenly stop and hover motionless for a period of time before darting off again.

Mrs. Schrader stated that she observed the objects for approximately 30 minutes before they finally disappeared from view. She said that the objects made no noise and left no trail or exhaust visible.

This report was taken by Sgt. Frank Baumann of the Champaign Police Department. No further information is available.
