Text extracted from the document:

YELLOW SPRINGS, OHIO
AUGUST 12, 1968

At approximately 12:50 AM on August 12, 1968, the observer was getting ready to leave her home to go to work. As she was going out the front door, she observed an unusual object coming from the north. The object was hovering over a field approximately 1/30 of a mile from her home. 

The object appeared to be about the size of a large car. It had a light on the top. She observed the object for approximately 15 minutes. During this time, the object hovered and occasionally moved back and forth in a horizontal motion across the field. The object seemed to be lit up from within. At one point, the object tilted and she could see the bottom of it, which appeared to be concave.

The observer called her relatives, but they saw nothing. The object eventually moved away to the north, increased in speed, and disappeared from sight. The observer stated she could not hear any sound from the object.

The duration of the sighting was about 15 minutes. The witness stated that during this time the object was visible, it seemed to move effortlessly and silently. It did not seem to have any visible propulsion system. The witness stated she felt uneasy about the experience and had no longer been able to sleep well since the occurrence.
