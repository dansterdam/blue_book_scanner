10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A very bright light, much brighter than the surrounding stars, 
was seen low in the southeastern sky. The light was reddish 
in color. The light appeared to be at a standstill for a few 
seconds, and then suddenly disappeared.
11. COMMENTS
The planet Jupiter was visible at the time of the observation, and was close to the position where the light was seen. The movement and sudden disappearance of the light was probably due to atmospheric conditions.
