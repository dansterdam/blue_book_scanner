Text extracted from the document:

These "imprded" impressions appear to have been pressed rather than dug. Roots in the a.d. extending into these holes we - not shared off, but were pressed heavily into the sides and bottom of those holes. Anyone digging these would have had to use considerable force to achieve this as impressions showed.

A young sassafras tree was broken in half six feet above the ground. The break was about 7 ft. 6 in. from the center of G. The tree was partially uprooted, probably due to the numerous visitors. The top of the tree was grasped and had some bark removed. This would seem to indicate that something had to crawl up on or down this tree. The bark itself was not greatly splintered. Sassafras is a soft wood and splinters greatly when broken, unless it is broken violently and with great force.

The limited data we have on the species indicates that in the area conditions as to soil depth, amount of humus, etc. a sassafras tree of 6-8 inch diameter would require 20-25 years to develop. If we use this type strength data and allow a spread concentration as appropriate piece strength, it might mean that a weight in excess of 1500 pounds to break the specimen. This indicates a sizable creature walked through or on (by?) this area.

There was a patch of moss about a foot from the center hole. These mosses were not in any way damaged, either by heat or by particles thrown from the hole. This is very important. This shows that the hole that fixed the sand in the 8. Although the central hole is 27 in. in diameter, it is not perfectly symmetrical.
