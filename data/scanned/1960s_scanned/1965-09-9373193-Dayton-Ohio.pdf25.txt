8 September 1965

To: TD4 TDBA (UFO)
WPAFB

From: Troy, Ohio 45394 Kings Rd.

Subject: Meteor

On the evening of September 7th, at about 7:10 PM I was riding a bike in a generally southwest direction (West by South) when I saw the meteor.

I started to look over my left shoulder(or to the south) to check on traffic behind me when I saw the meteor.
It was about 60Â° off the horizon and looked to be travelling the same direction that I was taking.
I watched it for perhaps three or four seconds and then it burned out.
There were no cars or any farm equipment close by, and it was very quiet. There was absolutely no noise from the fireball.

Later, as I changed my course to one almost due south I glanced around to see if any other objects were in the sky, but there were none. Nor, did I see any sign of the meteor after it burned out.

I'm sure this was a meteor - and it was a beauty!
