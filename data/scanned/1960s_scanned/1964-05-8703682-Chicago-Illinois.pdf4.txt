Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is a rather belated reply to your letter of November 18, but that's the way it is.

I had to agree with you as to the inadequacy of the after-image interpretation. This has been a recurrent problem of course.

One thing occurred to me in your letter too, and I suggest it only in order to put on the table some possible interpretations, you though I realize there are others. Could possibly be that certain distortions in the photograph could have been due to some electrostatic conditions - in other words, a kind of non-natural image. This may only be a wild guess because, again, I don't really know what you think about this possible interpretation. I do not offer it as necessarily the correct solution, but only as a possible line of speculation.

Let me know what you think about this possible interpretation. I do not offer it to contradict your own thinking. I did let me think about it and that is the after-effect of our job. I do feel that open-minded consideration of all possibilities is highly important in this kind of investigation. Our job is not only to examine the facts, but to be open to every reasonable possibility. I am sure you would agree with me on that.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
