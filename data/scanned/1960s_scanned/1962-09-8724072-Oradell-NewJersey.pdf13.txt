"THERE IS AN UNUSUAL OBJECT IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH WHICH IS IN EVIDENCE IN A DARK AREA JUST ABOVE THE HORIZON AGAINST THE SKY. IT APPEARS TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE AIRCRAFT AND ABOUT 1/8 THE LENGTH OF THE PICTURE FROM THE RIGHT SIDE. THE OBJECT IS INDISTINCT AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE SHARPLY DEFINED FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT IS TRULY A PHYSICAL OBJECT OR MERELY A PHOTOGRAPHIC IMPRESSION. HOWEVER, IT IS QUITE APPARENT AND STANDS OUT FROM THE GENERAL TERRAIN AND BACKGROUND. THERE IS NO INDICATION IN THE PICTURE OR IN THE AVAILABLE TEXT THAT THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF A SIGHTING OR THAT IT WAS TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH A CASE BEING INVESTIGATED. THE ORIGIN AND PURPOSE OF THIS PHOTOGRAPH ARE UNKNOWN."
