There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Mercury document, containing text describing visual observations from recovery aircraft, details about a flight on May 5, 1961, and plans for future Mercury-Redstone flights and Atlas-orbital flights.

PROJECT MERCURY
Visual observations from recovery aircraft revealed that the capsule floated upright for approximately 25 minutes after the heat shield dropped away. Postflight examination showed that the capsule heat shield had been damaged during reentry and failure to sever the lower heatshield had permitted reentry forces to subject the cabin to structural loads. Future capsules will utilize anchor chains which will prevent loss of the heat shield during landing.

Because of a malfunction on the previous flight and because of a delicate instrumentation problem, another capsule mounted on the booster was launched to qualify modified components prior to the planned flight. This test was flown on March 24, 1961, with a boilerplate capsule mounted on the booster. The launch was successful in every respect.

On May 5, 1961, Astronaut Alan B. Shepard flew a Mercury-Redstone mission. The flight attained an apogee of 115 statute miles and a range of 302 statute miles. No acceleration to zero-gravity was observed during the flight. Shepard's manual control system were identical to those of the flight simulators which he had practiced. Malfunction detecting system of the capsule retrofire, retropack jettison, and parachute deployment were just as indicting as in the simulators, correctly indicating that retropacket thrust measurement was critical to those which he had experienced many times on the human centrifuge. No difficulties were encountered with respect to zero-gravity and the results confirmed the adequacy of the training procedures.

Manned Mercury-Redstone flights will continue in 1961. The purpose of additional qualification flights is to qualify the Mercury-Atlas vehicle for the manned space environment.

Additional unmanned Atlas-orbital flights will be attempted prior to manned orbital flight. The ability of the Atlas guidance system to control the spacecraft attitude, velocity, and flight path angle must be demonstrated; the capsule systems must be qualified for orbital flight; and studies must show its ability to track the capsule and monitor the capsule systems.
