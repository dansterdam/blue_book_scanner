sound. The following morning, February 12, 1964, I called the Air Force in formation Service at PL-3-5509. I was told by the receptionist on duty that the matters were handled by your office and that I should write to you.
I would like to know if any other reports were received at the same time. What sort of explanation can you suggest for this sighting?
I will be glad to supply any further information if necessary.
Thank you.
Very truly yours,
