The object passed over the house and stayed back to Denney's house and lit settled us. All of a sudden it took off very bright to be. It seemed to be 5 stopped when we first saw it. It told over us halfway out there. On the way back to the house it started following us again. It hovered over the trees west of her house and finally disappeared.

It would get very bright and seem dim when are gone 5 stopped when we first saw it.

Sincerely,
