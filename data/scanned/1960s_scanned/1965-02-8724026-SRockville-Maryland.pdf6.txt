The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, with several questions and handwritten responses.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
In and out of the clouds, up and down, back and forth

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One):   Yes   /   No  Don't know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:
Could have

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   /   No  Don't know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:
Could have

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: too far to hear anything, least 15 miles
b. Color: white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and no.: how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Only a part of the head of the match would be covered.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please also show the direction the object was moving.
The handwritten text in this section describes the movement of the object, but does not include a drawn sketch.
