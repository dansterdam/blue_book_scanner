MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, TEAM 4, SAFPI

SUBJECT: Alaska UFO Sightings

1. The following information should be used in answering any inquiries regarding the sighting of an unknown object over Nome, Alaska on 6 March 1950.

2. There were two sightings in the Nome-Unalakleet area, the first on 18 February 1950.

3. On 18 February 1950, an object was observed as just a light, and recommended as being a balloon or aircraft. No conclusions were reached.

4. Of all the information provided to ATIC concerning an UFO sighting in the Nome area, this appears to be the only relevant case. The other information was merely reports of some unexplained lights, and it was impossible to determine their nature. Using only these factors, it was possible to develop an approximate 100 mile altitude for the sighting.

5. Subsequent to the ATIC conclusion on this case, Dr. Christian Stager, Director of Geophysical Institute, Alaska University, concluded that this sighting was a very bright meteor.

6. Other possibilities for the cause of this sighting: Very high altitude luminous weather phenomena, too high for jet aircraft.

7. ATIC has no information which indicates that more than one object was seen on this date. All of the data reported were consistent to within five minutes of a single observed object.
