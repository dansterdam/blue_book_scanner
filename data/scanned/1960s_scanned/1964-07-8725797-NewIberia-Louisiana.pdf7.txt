Dear Mr. (redacted),

The Air Force answered into a problem land level on 23 July 1964, a possible military investigation of the UFO observation. The information indicates that the sighting was not considered hostile by the unidentified flying object. The observation lasted nearly one minute, during which time the object is said to have been at a dangerously low level. The vehicle was dangerously underestimated in the skies to the ground.

Special on unidentified aerial phenomena is important in your information.

Sincerely,
MAJOR M. J. JAKES
PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER
OFFICE OF INFORMATION

Mr. (redacted)
Biloxi. Miss.
