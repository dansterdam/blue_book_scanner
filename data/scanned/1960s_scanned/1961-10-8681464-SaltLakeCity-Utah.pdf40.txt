OCT. 2, 1961 CENTRAL AIRPORT (LORENEN Z B 281)
AT NOON, A PILOT OF SALT LAKE CITY, WAS PREPARING FOR
TAKE-OFF WHEN HE SIGHTED A LARGE, GRAY-COLORED OBJECT HOVERING
TO THE NORTH-OF-THE-AIRPORT. AT FIRST HE THOUGHT IT WAS ANOTHER PLANE, AND HE WAS 
SURPRISED TO FIND THE OBJECT STILL IN THE SAME POSITION WHEN HE BECAME 
AIRBORNE. GRADUALLY HE CHANGED HIS HEADING AND FLEW TOWARD WHAT APPEARED TO BE 
A LARGE DISC HOVERING WITH A ROCKING MOTION AT AN ALTITUDE OF BETWEEN 6500 AND 7000 FEET. 
HE APPROACHED THE OBJECT THAT HE HAD SIGHTED WHAT HE THOUGHT TO BE 
A "FLYING SAUCER" AND WAS GOING TO GET A BETTER VIEW. HE ESTIMATED THE 
DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE OBJECT AT ABOUT FIVE MILES. SEVERAL OTHER
INDIVIDUALS ON THE GROUND ALSO SAW THE OBJECT. JUST LANDED HIS PLANE AND REPORTED THAT THIS OBJECT WAS NOT THERE WHEN HE 
CAME IN FOR HIS LANDING. THE OTHER SIX OBSERVERS WERE MR. AND MRS. SNOW, WHO WERE PREPARING FOR
A FLIGHT, AND AN EMPLOYEE OF UTE AEROMOTIVE BASED AT THE FIELD, AND
THEY ALL MADE USE OF A PAIR OF BINOCULARS AND AGREED THAT THE OBJECT 
HOWEVER WITH A ROCKING MOTION AND DESCRIBED A CIRCULAR MOVEMENT. IT ACHIEVED FANTASTIC SPEED. MEANWHILE, I ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE IN, AS HE 
APPROACHED THE REALIZING WAS JUDGED TO BE AT ALTITUDE FOR IT WAS AT 
EYE-LEVEL AT SIX THOUSAND FEET. HE HEADED TOWARD IT AND GOT A GOOD VIEW OF
THE OBJECT-SO TOP PORTHOLE AS IT TIPPED TOWARD HIM, CLEARLY SILHOUETTED AGAINST
THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SOUTH. 
THE OBJECT THE APPEARANCE OF "SAND-BLASTED" ALUMINUM. THERE WERE NO
CLOUDS OR GROUND HAZE, AND VISIBILITY WAS EXCELLENT. JUDGING FROM THE ACTUAL 
DISTANCE OF THE HILLS TO THE SOUTH, HE ESTIMATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT
FIVE MILES SOUTH OF THE FIELD WHEN SPOTTED AND THAT HE GOT WITHIN THREE MILES 
OF IT BEFORE IT MOVED AWAY. THE DEPARTURE WAS STRANGE. IT BEGAN A VERTICAL
CLIMB AND THEN HEADED SOUTH. IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT FIFTY FEET IN DIAMETER
AND GAVE TO TEN FEET THICK AT THE CENTER. THERE WERE NO PROTRUSIONS.
PORTOLES, WINGS, ETC. AND IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF TWO SHALLOW DISHES JOINED 
TOGETHER AT THE RIM. FOLLOWED THE OBJECT WHEN IT BEGAN ITS FLIGHT AND
OBSERVED IT AS IT SUDDENLY HALTED AND HOVERED AT A POINT ALMOST DIRECTLY ABOVE
THE LAKE UNTIL STATIONARY. THEN IT MOVED STRAIGHT UP AND BEGAN TO MOVE WEST AT AN
EXTREMELY ACCELERATED RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED IN A FEW SECONDS. DURING 
THE CHASE MAINTENANCE COMMUNICATIONS WITH BOTH UTAH CENTRAL AIRPORT AND 
THE PROVO AIRPORT. IN ADDITION, HE RELAYED INFORMATION TO THE FEDERAL 
AVIATION ASSOCIATION COMMUNICATIONS TOWER AT SALT LAKE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT.
