The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch shows a compass rose with the cardinal directions labeled. The smaller sketches show silhouettes of a person in a landscape, illustrating the movement and position of a phenomenon that was observed.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION-ORIENTATION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "P" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "P" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO SCHEMATICALLY SHOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS PART.
