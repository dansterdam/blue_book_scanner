There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text describes the sighting of two large, hazy objects traveling through the sky in a northeasterly direction, and provides details about their appearance and movement.

Saturday morning, October 21, 1967
Mr. XXX -- living 6:15 this morning, Saturday, October 21, 1967. I saw two large hazy objects traveling through the sky in a northeasterly direction from here. The objects were to the north, moving in what appeared to be a north-northeast direction. They were estimated to be east to west-possibly south east to northwest-. 
Flying, one slightly behind the other in what would seem to be a formation relationship, they resembled a large double-shaped object with a fiery tail, The object traveled in that seemed to be a straight line. They were visible for only a short period.
Their speed was exceptionally great,much like a meteor or missiles. The difference was in the course of travel. These objects maintained a more horizontal flight as opposed to the usual meteor or missile which travels in a more diagonal direction. There was an undetermined time lapse between the two objects. They disappeared into the distance and seemed to be the same size (or) flight course the entire distance covered.
I called the Carter of Sheriffs Office, Henry A. Rolf, Jr. and reported the incident. Maj. ________ of the 11XXX Air Force Base was notified and the Civil Authorities were informed. Time was told: that this was not passed to public information channel, the investigation is continuing.
