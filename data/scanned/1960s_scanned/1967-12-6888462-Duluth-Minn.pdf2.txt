APT 20-17(CI)
INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

(2) CAUSE AND SIGHTING: On 4 December 1967 at approximately 8:30 p.m., my wife and I observed a strange light in the sky over Duluth, Minnesota. It appeared to be larger than a normal aircraft light and was moving in a erratic manner, changing directions rapidly. It appeared to remain stationary at times, then move in a straight line, and then suddenly accelerate and change directions. The light was very bright, almost blinding, and seemed to be self-illuminated. We observed it for approximately 15 minutes before it disappeared.

(3) FURTHER DETAILS: I am a former Air Force officer and have considerable experience in observing aircraft. This light behaved in a manner that I have never seen before with any conventional aircraft. It did not resemble any known type of aircraft or other celestial object. The movements were completely unexplainable in terms of known aerodynamics or propulsion systems. I must conclude that what we observed was some type of unidentified flying object. I hope that this report will be of use to your investigation of this incident.
