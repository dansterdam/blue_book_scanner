Hovering Object in Arizona Canyon

Air X, a Tucson importer, was returning home from a trip to Wyoming in his private plane. As he was flying along Highway 89 near Tucson, he spotted a "UAO" (or Unidentified Aerial Object) hovering at about 1,500 feet. This was around 6:30 p.m. when he was near Vails (Green) Road crossing. He saw the triangular-shaped object hovering over the area. It was clearly silhouetted against the hills. It had a "cold blue" glow surrounding it. As he came closer, he rounded a curve and his headlights caught the object, whereupon it shot up, then headed southwest and disappeared in the direction of Buckeye. The entire sighting lasted about 15 minutes. The observer made a personal report, but details of the sighting were withheld. The observer is considered to be a reliable individual, and said he had seen a similar object on the ground at La Madera in April of 1964.
