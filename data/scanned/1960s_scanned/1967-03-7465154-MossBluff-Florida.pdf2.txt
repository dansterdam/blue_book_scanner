The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a sketch diagram with various angles and instructions for the witness to follow.

The text from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the horizon where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the horizon where you last saw the object. Show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that i they moved.
