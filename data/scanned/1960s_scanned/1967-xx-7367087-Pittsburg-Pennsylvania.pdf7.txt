Proposed reply to Jon McDonald (Sighting: July 26, 1967)

Dear Mr. _____,

This replies to your recent letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object on July 26, 1967. 

Investigation has revealed that you probably observed the planet Venus. At approximately 9:30 p.m., EDT, on July 26, 1967, Venus would have been on an azimuth of 275 degrees, at an elevation of eight degrees.

You stated, "... Venus at this time of the year is not even close or even on the horizon line." According to the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac 1967, Venus set at approximately 10:00 p.m., EDT on July 26, 1967. Thus, the planet would have been near the horizon at 9:30 p.m. EDT.

You also mentioned that when viewed with binoculars the object at first appeared somewhat fuzzy or blurred. This is normally expected since the images formed by binocular lenses often show spherical aberration.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
