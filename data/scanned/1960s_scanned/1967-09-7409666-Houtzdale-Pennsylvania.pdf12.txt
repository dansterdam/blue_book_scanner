IDET/UFO
UFO Observations & Photographs

Mr. 
Houtzdale, Pennsylvania 16651

1. Reference your latest letter of October 12, 1967 in which you included two photographs and two slides of alleged unidentified flying objects (UFOs). We are returning your photographs and slides for it is unclear to have a physical light source analyzed since all that photo analyst personnel will not be able to determine is that it is a natural sight course.

2. In order for something to be called an UFO, the observer must see details that cannot usually be explained. Therefore, satellites, balloons, aircraft and stars cannot be called UFOs. 

3. The purpose of the photographs is to show the object that:
a. The object really existed and/or
b. To give the physical details of the object.

4. We have previously written to you that we feel that most of your sightings are of satellites. These do not meet the definition of an UFO. Nevertheless, they do not seem to be anything in the sky that you saw really exists; something which was never doubted.

5. When a person sees something in the sky that he cannot explain (a UFO) he should submit his report to the nearest Air Force Installation for they are in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. The nearest Air Force UFO investigator to you is:
