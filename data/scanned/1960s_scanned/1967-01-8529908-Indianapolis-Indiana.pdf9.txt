There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire with several questions about a reported UFO sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It seemed slowly to go away.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes
No
Don't know

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes 
No
If you answered YES:
in front of? ____________

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Unusual hissing
b. Color Bright yellowish somewhat oblong
c. Size Larger than the full moon

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? This is important, even if you had difficulty with this experiment. What have you learned about the object's angular size? The match head could not be covered very far, so the size appeared relatively small. 

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any distinguishing features of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
