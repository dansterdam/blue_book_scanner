If results should indicate that public concern has been over-

official (government) interest in UFOs.
The history of Project Blue Book alone has shown that the 
UFO phenomena is mainly that of a public relations problem. The 
fringe of believers in extraterrestrial visitation continues
to grow. UFO hobby clubs are a constant critic of Air Force
policies -- the majority of these clubs profess to be studying
the phenomena scientifically.
However, it should be recognized that the public could be
expected to accuse the Air Force of withholding information on
UFOs since their investigation has been assigned to Air Force
Technical Intelligence.
