ADDENDUM

This report would not be complete without some mention of the psychological impact of the sighting to the witnesses themselves. The observers spoke of the strange light as an "object" and visualized that the object was unusual; there was no panic. There was mere curiosity to know what it was. Naturally, there was much speculation - one or two thought it was a new device of our own government (and were indignant at the idea of letting it over a foreign country at this particular time); 

Someone inquired whether it wasn't more than a star, but most were willing to believe it was some new aircraft of secret origin. The majority took it back Saturday night over the same spot to take a photograph. But the majority thought that whatever it was, it was from outer space rather than from Russia.

Many witnesses complained that they had felt completely frustrated in their efforts to report the sighting to the "proper authorities". One witness was told to "call back on Monday". 

Some were sure the strange cloud which followed the explosion, and wondered whether there had been a detonation in the area. They said, "Why wasn't an investigation made?"

Uppermost in the minds of many was the total absence of jet or military aircraft during the entire period of lighting (approximately one hour, Saturday night). (This fact is indicated on all signed reports of this sighting.)

These witnesses represent a cross-section of the many hundreds who witnessed this strange phenomenon over Hollywood, two nights in succession - and without doubt reflect the thinking of all concerned. They are asking questions - and they say they have the right to know.
