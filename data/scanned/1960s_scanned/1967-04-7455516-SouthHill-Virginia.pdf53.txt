The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document page from Project Blue Book, discussing an incident related to a person named Crowder.

Later, when I asked Martin about Crowder's reputation, Martin replied: "If Mr. Crowder... (chuckles) I can't say the man is not telling the truth because I don't know anything of his private life. But if he saw anything, then I saw the light from it."

On several other occasions, Martin claimed to have seen the light from Crowder's car while Crowder was inside. He said, "If he (Crowder) saw the real object, then I saw the light from it."

Martin volunteered an interesting comment about the remarkable similarity between the large aluminum tank used by Crowder to store liquid fertilizer which sits just outside his office window. Martin says the incident did not strike him as extraordinary at the time, because the 600 debt points to Crowder's normal activities like going outside long enough for the police to arrive at the site.

According to the text, the document is discussing a "Trail Hypothesis" related to the question of how it was possible for Crowder to see the headlights of his car, when the car lights were turned off, and if the road was not yet arrived.
