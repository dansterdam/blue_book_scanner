There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This seems to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

STARS: A small elongated orange colored light extending east to west was observed bearing 120 degrees true at an elevation of approximately 45 degrees. Approximately 45 seconds later, bearing 050 degrees true elevation 70 degrees a round silverish light appeared, closely resembling a miniature moon. This light became larger and brighter, resembling a hazy moon. Until it reached what appeared to be a diameter of about 6-8 times that of full moon. This took approximately 55-57 seconds. At this time it blossomed out in a burst of bright orange light still retaining its globular shape, expanding to a proportion approximately 75-95 times that of full moon. This took approximately 7 seconds, at which time it quickly faded and disappeared. Slight traces of orange were observed 1 minute later, then completely disappeared. It was concluded that the object of this sighting was a NASA experimental rocket launch from Wallops Island, Va., which released sodium material considerably higher than 100 miles above the earth. The chemical released was visible for some distance in the Atlantic Ocean and up and down the Atlantic seaboard and as far inland as areas of the mid-western U. S.
