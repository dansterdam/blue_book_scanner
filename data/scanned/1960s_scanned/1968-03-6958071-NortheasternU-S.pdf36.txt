Dear Sirs:

On March 4th, one of our local newspapers, "The Nashville Tennessean," published an account of sightings of an UFO and put it on front page. The Tennessean gave a report that I shall copy in parts --- March 15, 1960 --- traveling from southwest to northeast in a flat trajectory.

Descriptions of the UFO varied slightly, but, in general, as it flew over Nashville, it was described as fuselage-shaped with lights that appeared from windows. All agreed that it was flying at a high rate of speed and made no noise. Many reported an orange-reddish-brown light at the object. Officially it is to be BLUE BOOK (subject) said they had numerous reports of sightings. They also reported that the UFO had been seen in Little Rock, Ark., Memphis, Tenn., Jackson, Tenn., Lexington, Ky., and Roanoke, Va. A person named that the FBI had reports of sightings all over the southeast.

I have written a report containing a description of my sighting of the UFO and its flight as I observed it over Nashville, Tenn., while standing beside Mayor. I wrote my description from notes I had taken a few days after the event, as I had learned in school that for better accuracy, one should take notes early. I feel it important to relate to you, though alcoholic beverage that I had consumed prior to my UFO sighting. Also, I feel it important to relate to you some references as to my character.

March 2nd, I consumed no alcoholic beverages -- or drugs of any kind.
March 3rd: I consumed no alcoholic beverages (or drugs) until we arrived.
