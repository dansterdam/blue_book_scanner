WHEN THE CEASE CAT, AS OCCUPANT OF SAID VEHICLE, WAS COMING OUT OF THE HOUSE, AND WAVING MOTIONS WITH HIS HANDS SUGGESTING THAT HE NEEDED WATER OR SOME OTHER LIQUID. THAT IS, HE MADE DRINKING MOTIONS. THIS HASTENED HIS VEHICLE" (WHICH HE SAYS) WHICH HE WAS QUITE ANXIOUS TO LEAVE HERE. "A BEAUTIFUL THING", HE SAID. HE TOOK IT TO THE BASEMENT WHERE HE HAS PUMP AND FILLED IT WITH WATER, CARRIED IT OUT TO THE CRAFT, AND INSTALLED IT BACK IN THERE. IN DOING SO, HE GOT UP ON A LADDER AND PUT ONE HAND AGAINST THE CRAFT, HE SAYS, AND EFFECTED THE TRANSFER OF THE JUG. HE DESCRIBED THE INTERIOR AS SPECIFICALLY BRIGHT, AND SAID HE SAW THREE CONTROL PANELS. HE DESCRIBED THE THING WITH TWO OTHER MEN INSIDE. FROM HIS DESCRIPTION, IT APPEAR TO BE EXTREMELY CLEAN-SHAVEN, OR SHAVED, AND SHORT, ABOUT 5 FEET, HE EXPLAINED. HE SAID THEY LOOKED LIKE INDIANS. THEIR DRESS WAS ALSO PLAIN, A METALLIC GRAYISH "COVERALL" TYPE GARMENT. FROM HIS ACCOUNT, IT SEEMS TO GO ON TO SAY THAT IT WAS MORE LIKE THE STEREOTYPED PICTURE ONE GETS OF ITALIAN SPORT CAR RACERS, OR AT ANY RATE, AS THE REPORT SAYS "THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION EXCEPT BY SIGN LANGUAGE WITH THEM". AND HE SEEMED THEM, AND HE SEEMED SURPRISED THAT HIS CRAFT, HIS VEHICLE, LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE THEIR CRAFT.
