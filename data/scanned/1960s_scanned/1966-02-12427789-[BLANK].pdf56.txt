it, and it would be very rash indeed to preclude, from our present vantage point, the possibility of its development by other civilizations. If each of, say, a million advanced technical civilizations in our galaxy launched an interstellar spacecraft per year (and even for an advanced civilization, the launching of an interstellar space vehicle will not be a trivial undertaking), and even if all stars in the galaxy can be explored with equal facility, then our solar system should, on the average, be visited only once every hundred thousand years.

UFO enthusiasts have sometimes castigated the skeptic for anthropocentrism. Actually, the view that the Earth is daily visited by interstellar spacecraft is far more anthropocentric. If even a small fraction of the residual UFOs are interstellar in origin, this would imply an overriding significance to our small planet; as if all the professional anthropologists in the world converged on one of the Andaman Islands because the fishnet had recently been invented there. Anthropologists have other interests. Only a few specialize in the cultures of the Andaman Islands. If our views on the frequency of intelligence in the galaxy are correct, there is no reason for the Earth to be singled out for interstellar visits. A somewhat greater frequency of visits
