I SPOTTED UFO WINCH
People like us are FRIENDLY - some are not - COME AND VISIT.
Spent some time on ground people soaked of light.
I FELT LIKE I'D ACTUALLY BEEN TO ANOTHER WORLD -
MAYBE I WAS, MAYBE A CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF SOME SORT.
Reportedly about 1 1/2 stories tall, a brilliant display! could well
go from a man's height to 30 ft in an instant. Stayed about a minute.
- We may have clearance at that time or may not have seen it.
Homes, trees, the surroundings would tell as I now realize after my 1st
close encounter of some kind - Could have been a test or for other
reasons as I'm here and many are.
