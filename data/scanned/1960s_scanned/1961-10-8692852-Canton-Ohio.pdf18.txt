Another frightening UFO encounter--
A 50-mile chase was reported by Mr.
and Mrs. Richard DeSelle, 1531 Shirley
Ave., Canton, Ohio. On the night
of Oct. 23, they saw a "wcirdaer
'brightly illuminated object' suddenly
flash in the sky. It seemed to be
about the size of a basketball. It
flashed and blinked and suddenly
disappeared from sight.

"At first I thought it was an airplane
making an emergency landing," Mrs.
DeSelle told the local newspaper, The
Canton Repository. "But the strange
maneuver of the object as it flashed
back into the sky, DeSelle
estimated that it may have been
travelling at over 1,200 miles an
hour when it disappeared. The
reflection was quickly dispersed.
With the disappearance of the
object, we were filled with
astonishment and wonder--and
a little apprehension," Mrs. DeSelle
said. "There was no noise and no
trail. The object just vanished."
"It seemed very real to us,"
they both commented. "We weren't
imagining it. There were no other
witnesses, but we know what we saw."
