The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object. The text in the document appears to be a questionnaire or report related to observations of this object.

14. Did the object disappear, go behind something, or move out of sight while you were watching it? It WHAT happened to it:
Went behind a cloud and one disappeared (actually went out of sight)

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes - IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:
A building

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes - IF you answered YES, then tell what:
In front of a cloud

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound -- No sound
b. Color -- white, one red

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil's length in line with a known object and move how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
about the same size

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show if trails or vapor trails were present or seem to show the direction the object was moving.
