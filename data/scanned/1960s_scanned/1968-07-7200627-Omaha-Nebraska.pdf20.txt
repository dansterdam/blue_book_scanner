The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document with handwritten notes and redactions. The text in the document appears to be part of a UFO report from Project Blue Book, dated 1968-07-7200627 and originating from Omaha, Nebraska.

As requested, I will now produce all the text found in the document:

What you are looking at is a strange thing in the sky. It was dark, and the object appeared to be larger than an automobile. It seemed to be over 500 feet above the ground, and was moving in a straight line. It was going faster than any airplane that I've ever seen. I saw this object for about 4 or 5 minutes. It seemed to have a red light on the front and a blue light on the back. Then it just seemed to disappear in the distance.

How far away was it when you first saw it? I would say it was at least 1/2 mile away from where I was standing. Do you want to know how high it seemed to be? Well, it was up in the air, I'd say it was over 500 feet high. It was going across the sky, and it was going much faster than any plane I've ever seen. I'd say it was really moving, just streaking across the sky.

What did it look like? Well, it was dark, but it seemed to be larger than a car. And it had a red light on the front and a blue light on the back. It just seemed to disappear in the distance, it didn't do anything fancy, it just kept going straight and then it was gone.

How long did you see it? Well, I'd say I saw it for 4 or 5 minutes, maybe a little less. I was just standing there watching it go across the sky. It was really moving fast, faster than any plane I've ever seen. Just streaking across the sky.

Did you hear any sound from it? No, I didn't hear any sound at all. It was just moving silently across the sky. Didn't make any noise that I could hear.

What were the weather conditions like at the time? It was a clear night, no clouds in the sky. Just a dark night, that's all.
