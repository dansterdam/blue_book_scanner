Mr. _____ [redacted]

On the evening of July 10, 1962, I saw a very unusual aircraft. Thinking it to be an experimental aircraft, I observed it for a period of time and then proceeded to investigate further. The sighting, however, the People's Star-Ledger carried a front page story of a similar sighting the following evening in Vineland, New Jersey. By the information given in this article, it appears to be the same thing I saw the previous evening in this vehicle of the aircraft. It appears to be the same thing. The sighting was given by an observer in the article, however, is more comprehensive than I can make. I am sending you a brief resume of what I saw. I am sure this information will be of value to you.

1. I saw the flying object on July 10, 1962 at 11:20 P.M. (Eastern Daylight Saving Time).
2. The size of the object and the sighting took place may be examined by the following:
U.S. Route 1
