Very slowly
Very bright object color white, then green and white. One side had finger-like projections. Larger than stars and occasional round and disappeared.

The object responsible for this sighting was probably an unidentified aerial phenomenon. Its characteristics, such as color changes and finger-like projections, are not typical of known aircraft or celestial objects. The witness's description indicates it was a very bright, unusual object that exhibited unconventional behavior. However, without further evidence or investigation, a definitive identification could not be made.
