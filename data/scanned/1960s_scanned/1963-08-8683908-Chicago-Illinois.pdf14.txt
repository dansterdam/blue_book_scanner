17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Noise or flash of light as a rocket.
b. Color - Bright light with a tail.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the head of the match?
Circular - small part.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details or the object such as wings, protrusions, etc., and indicate on the sketch the direction the object was moving.
