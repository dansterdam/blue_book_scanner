Washington 25, D.C.

Gentlemen,

Enclosed is an itemized list about the strange appearances observed during a period when a number of them were reported in your vicinity. This list has been prepared based on the ATIC (United States Air Force Technical Information Center) records and is the result of a careful study made here in Washington. Alexandria, Va. 1950.) and printed by Hutchinson and Seattle. 1950.), and would like to add that it would be pleased if you might find it possible to confirm or deny those sightin(g)s described therein.

This strange object happened to zoom above my opposite direction at a very fast-moving speed in many other cases of very short duration (1-2 seconds) so that I could not see it precisely. At times it seemed to disappear and reappear at different places in the sky. I tried to watch the sky and there were a few more sightings during the next few minutes but the nature of it remains to be explained to finding stars.

The data here presented may indicate that related observations were made in other directions or the first sightings listed on the attached sheet.

It is with the hope that this information might be of some use for your investigations. I am sending this letter.

Yours truly,

Address: Yenikebir, Ankara, Turkey

Encl: 1 list.
