Southampton again
From the Southern Evening Echo of
December 4, 1965, we read how Mrs.
Wendy Poulton, a bank clerk watched
an object from her bedroom window
on the evening of the 1st. She said:
"The first time I saw it was
when it moved across the sky from the
direction of the docks," she says.
"Now, apparently, the object has
been around for a few days. It is a
ball-shaped object with a brilliant
glowing centre. Wendy and her
father, Mr. P. J. Poulton, who runs a
hairdresser and fruiter business,
have looked at it through powerful
binoculars."
"It appears as soon as it gets dark
and is brighter than all the stars. It is
oval in shape and seems to have two
glowing ends," says Wendy.
"Mr. Poulton sees it as a brilliant,
firework sparkler. It moves around:
last night it was over the Civic
Centre."
