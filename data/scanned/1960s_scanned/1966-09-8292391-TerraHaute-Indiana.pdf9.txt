The image provided does not contain a photograph. It shows a page from an old UFO report document, containing a schematic diagram and some text instructions.

The text from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass rose to show where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass rose to show where you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path, a "B" to end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were going.
