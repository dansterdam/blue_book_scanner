THE UNUSUAL AND FANTASTIC ASPECT OF THE PHENOMENON OUR SENSES PERCEIVED IN THE SKY THAT MORNING WAS INDEED SO STRIKING THAT IT HAS IMPRESSED ITSELF INDELIBLY ON OUR MEMORY. IT WAS A TRULY EXTRAORDINARY APPARITION. WHAT WE SAW WAS A GIGANTIC CIGAR-SHAPED OBJECT, SILVER GREY IN COLOR, HOVERING SILENTLY IN THE CLEAR BLUE SKY. IT WAS MOVING AT A FAIRLY HIGH SPEED FROM NORTH TO SOUTH, MAINTAINING A CONSTANT ALTITUDE AND COURSE. AFTER TRAVELING FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES IT SUDDENLY STOPPED, REMAINED STATIONARY FOR A FEW SECONDS, AND THEN ACCELERATED AT FANTASTIC SPEED IN A VERTICAL DIRECTION UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.
