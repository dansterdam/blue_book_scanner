Transcribed text:

On the night of January 17, 1965, at Richard S. Woodruff's home in Bethel, Vermont, many strange lights were observed by the witness moving at such high speed that they were hard to follow. The objects seemed to be round or circular and there were many of them moving at a high speed. At times, the objects seemed to hover and then dart off at a terrific speed.
