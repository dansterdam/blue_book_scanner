The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. It shows a map or diagram on the left side, but there is no photograph present on this page.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document, without any additional commentary:

LOCATION: CLEARWATER, FLORIDA 
DATE: JULY 8, 1964
