I saw your ad to w.d.a in the afternoon to get my mother. We started mark about 11:00 p.m. We did not stop at all.
We were listening to the radio. After leaving last stop light in Lancaster, traveling west on 33, a bright light in sky caught my attention at top of windshield. I watched object in erratic zigzag motion. As object went behind hill, I went to phone my mother and said "Did you see that?" She said "Yes, "It looked alike." We continued on 33 looking.
