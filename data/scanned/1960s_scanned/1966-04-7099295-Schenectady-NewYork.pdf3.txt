GRIFFISS AIR FORCE BASE, NEW YORK 13440

11 APRIL 1966

SUBJECT: UFO Sightings

TO: Foreign Technology Div (TDSA/UFO)
ATTN: TDETR
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO 45433

1. Two sightings were made in the Schenectady, New York area on the evening of 4 March 1966.

2. Although final determination of the attached sightings is not yet complete, the following is the determination of the investigating officer:

a. Lighting and shape of the objects concerns to that of a helicopter having a single light source on the underside giving an overall illumination of the body and a very bright single light at the rear or tail of the aircraft. The maneuver characteristics reported are also relative to that of helicopter operation.

b. A GCA radar was made to Schenectady Airport and Albany Airport on 4 April 1966 and negative reports received in reference to helicopter operations.

3. Although no helicopter based at the above airports were operating, the possibility of a light twin-engine aircraft with landing lights on cannot be ruled out. No further information available.
