Gentlemen:

I would like to report a phenomenon to you, and would appreciate
it if you know of some explanation. It occurred June 17, 1967.

At about 9:30 P.M. we were motoring along in a cove just above
Marsh Point on the Sassafras River, Md. It was one of the most
beautiful nights I have ever seen. The sky was clear, the stars
shining brightly, and the river like a mirror. Suddenly we
saw a series of perhaps 20 to 30 flashes in a diagonal pattern
across the sky. These flashed on and off, a second between each
flash. They were of a size and intensity about that of a planet
and proceeded from about directly above towards the horizon in a
very straight line. This was not like anything I have ever seen,
and then simply stopped about 45Â° above the horizon. The flashes
seemed to be some kind of unconventional lighting as I have tried
to convey to you. There were no colored lights, sounds, or any
other indicia of an aircraft.

I have attached a drawing. There were no colored lights, sounds
or other indicia of an aircraft. The entire phenomenon lasted
perhaps 20 to 30 seconds.

The only thing I can imagine, unless it is a "UFO", would be some
kind of test of such a missile type photograph.

If you know of an explanation I would appreciate hearing from you,
otherwise we will just have to file this away as a "UFO". Naturally I
wish there could be some plausible explanation that doesn't leave
one to speculate that doesn't have a common technical
explanation.

Very truly yours,
