The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter discussing photographs of unidentified flying objects that were previously submitted. The letter mentions that the images appear genuine but cannot be conclusively determined to be of natural or artificial origin. The letter also references a 1967 report on Project Blue Book that the recipient may find interesting.

Dear Mr. _______

I am inclosing the photographs of alleged unidentified flying objects which you submitted for evaluation.

Again, the images appear genuine (as opposed to photographic phenomena); however, it is not possible to determine the cause or nature of the objects.

These photographs are so similar to those submitted in your April 10, 1966 observation that we did not send them to our photographic analysis laboratory. Although it is difficult to determine the nature of the objects, the images clearly show the objects in the air and photographed.

Also included is the 1967 report on Project Blue Book which I think you will find interesting.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
