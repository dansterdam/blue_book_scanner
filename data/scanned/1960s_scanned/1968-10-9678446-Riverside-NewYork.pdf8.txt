Dear Capt. Honnaker,
We saw this sighting at 4:00 pm on Saturday, 24 August 62. We saw the object at about 4:00 pm Sunday, 25 August. The object was about 16" in diameter and steel grey in color. These are real names,
Riverdale New York (...), Riverdale New York (...), Riverdale New York (...)
When we first saw it it was black and circular. It moved very rapidly toward the George Washington Bridge. At about 9:30 am the object was standing still surrounded by a haze, then it took off traveling at an extremely high rate of speed out of sight. The object was approximately 60'-70' in diameter.
