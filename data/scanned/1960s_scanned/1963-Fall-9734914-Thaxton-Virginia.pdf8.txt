It is my belief that the UFO seen on the clear photo from the different cross-winds or currents on a lake is entirely true. I am inclosing two sets of bloom & perhaps it dried through, thrown into the air. It is a large well-defined object, and with the trail of electric fans. You may have the same picture I sent. I'm not inclosing this for what I have in mind - having a hefty on your findings.

Sincerely yours,
