ANALYSIS OF REPORTED UFO'S SIGHTINGS NEAR SALEM, VIRGINIA
APRIL 7, 1967

The object was described as bright white and elliptical in shape, hovering relatively low over a rural field. The witness reported the object was silent and remained stationary for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

No physical evidence of the object was found at the scene. The report was evaluated as an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) due to the credible witness account and lack of a conventional explanation.
