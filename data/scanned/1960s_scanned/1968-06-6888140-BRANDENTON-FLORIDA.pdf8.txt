I just appeared, it wasn't any familiar shape. It was a light, a
beautiful light, almost white, glowing, about the size of a 50 
cent piece. It wasn't a familiar light because it didn't shoot
up from the ground and it wasn't any practical occasion to have
this.
Called Cotton, Fla. Police and the
object looked as though it could drop further about 2000 feet.
The object could go break further although it floated very
slowly and softly as if the laws were suspended.
I heard the exploitation. The sound of the exploitation sounded
like a jet taking off.  There were no changing colors in the sky.
The skyt was drug clear.
