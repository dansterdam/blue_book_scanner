UFO case about 315 degrees no sound, two blinking lights, about 50 feet apart or a jet plane seemed to be grass. It has no body or fuselage diameter about 200 yards made light. There was a glow about 4 feet in length and 2 feet in width. At this point, the object slowed down, thought it's all over that he (AP Reg) stopped out of his car and watched it go further as it seemed to fade into the distance. It did not seem to unwind or lose any of its luster, but as it got further away, it just became dimmer and dimmer until it got lost in the distance.
