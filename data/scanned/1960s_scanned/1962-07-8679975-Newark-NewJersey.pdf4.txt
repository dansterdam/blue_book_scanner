The image contains a newspaper article with the headline "Flying Ad. Not Saucer". The article discusses an object that was observed in the sky, which was initially thought to be a flying saucer, but turned out to be an advertising plane. The article mentions that the object was observed multiple times over a three-day period, and was later determined to be an advertising plane owned by a company called A. Wertheimer Co.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

NEWARK EVENING NEWS, SATURDAY, JULY 14, 1962

Flying Ad. Not Saucer

It appears that those unidentified flying objects reported by residents earlier this week may have been nothing more than an advertising airplane being towed by the airplane.

A close examination of the latest story as to the subject which had been described by anxious persons as a "flying saucer" has disclosed that the strange lights observed over the metropolitan area Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights were in reality those of an airplane towing an advertising sign.

The 38-foot-long sign had 333 electric lights which flashed in sequence, giving the appearance of being some kind of unusual aerial object. It was owned by the A. Wertheimer Co., of Newark, and the plane was being operated by that firm.
