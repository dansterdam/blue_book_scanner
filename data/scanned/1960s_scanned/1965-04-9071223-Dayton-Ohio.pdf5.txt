17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object would have been covered by the match head. If you performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Size of the object: I did not perform this experiment, so I cannot provide those details.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please do not draw anything to show the direction the object was moving.
