UFO sightings, Massachusetts, 25 Aug 64

1. We are in receipt of two unidentified flying object reports 
from Saugus, Massachusetts. One report is from Mr Edwin F Fowler, 
a NICAP member, who is a private citizen. The other report is from 
Mrs Annette Shea, a resident of the area.

Our evaluation, Massachusetts, 25 August 1964 - no information was presented in the sighting of two bright objects observed close to each other that this observation could be satisfactorily explained.

3. Regarding the sighting, the time motion sequence of the objects was not clearly indicated and times of movement were not given. Mr Fowler should be recontacted so that more details of the direction or turn, or speeds of the objects might be obtained to possibly explain the sighting as a known aircraft or some other natural phenomena. The Air Force should make an additional effort to determine the time motion sequence of the objects sighted.

4. Regarding the sighting, the object or objects were reportedly sighted for a short period, estimated as about 2-3 minutes but the association with the sighting of a ground observer for less than 1 minute is questionable. It is little scientific value without precise and confirmed sighting details of the object or objects.

5. The Air Force regards all reliable and credible visual sightings as legitimate and important observations and will make reasonable efforts to resolve such sightings. However, we have no other reports of this sighting and thus regard this report as being of low scientific value. Also, no physical evidence was recovered.
