Resume of Conversation:
He (the witness) and his brother were at the USAGO station at the time of the sighting. They observed an object in the sky at an approximate elevation of 30 degrees and azimuth of 225 degrees. The object was at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet for a duration of approximately 5 minutes. The object appeared to be round or circular in shape, quite large, and was brightly illuminated, like a powerful spotlight. It passed at a tremendous speed with no noise or trail. It passed directly over the USAGO station and then disappeared from sight to the west. The witness wished to also report it to Picatinny Arsenal, as it may be of interest to them. He indicated that the object appeared to be originating from Russia inasmuch as it appeared to approach from that direction and linger at one point. He would be happy to discuss this further with Picatinny Arsenal personnel, if interested.
