11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers reported seeing a round object with various colors such as blinking colors. At 200-300 yards. It looked like the screen of a 21" T.V. set. The white lights were the most of the time while the red, blue, and green ones twinkled. The white ones blinked once and awhile like the blinker on a tail light.
