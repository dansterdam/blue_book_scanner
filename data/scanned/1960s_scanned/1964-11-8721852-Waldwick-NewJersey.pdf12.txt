Dear Sirs:
At approximately 5:30 P.M. EST, we saw what we believe a UFO. Let me give you the facts leading up to this sight. At 5:30 P.M. just a bit cloudy after the sun had gone. At 5:32 P.M. 2 boys and I walked with 3 or 4 of the girls down town for a soda and then drove the girls home. We arrived at a railroad crossing, here was the first time we saw the object. It was hovering just over the tracks. We watched it as it came across the sky a distance and we thought it was an airplane. As it got closer we could see that it was not an airplane but a strange object. It had a hazy reddish orange glow around it and it just hovered, there was no visible means of propulsion. Then it started to move again and it was traveling at a very high rate of speed, approximately 1,600 to 2,500 M.P.H. It went across the sky and was out of sight in a matter of seconds. The sky was still partly clear and pollution free. There is no doubt in our minds that this was not an airplane or a satellite. It was something that was quite unusual and had us all puzzled. I will appreciate any information you can give us regarding this sighting. If you have any information on sightings near this area, please let me know.

Thanking you in advance.
