Somewhere, between 8 and 9 p.m., as I was walking across my back yard from the house to a tool house, I looked up and saw what I took to be a very brightly-lighted airplane, moving from east to west. My first thought was that it was an aircraft of the Tactical Air Command, which has headquarters near Richmond; but I checked with TAC and it did not have any tankers in this area at that time.

Also, I checked with the Air Traffic Control Regular people at Richmond's Byrd Field, to see if they had picked up anything unusual on their screen Thursday night, and they said they had not. This sighting of mine would have been well within range of the Field's radar.

After calling the Air Force in Washington, I had about decided that this was a civilian airliner, with its bright cabin lights visible through the overcast, because its speed and direction were consistent with that. But, because a man had called from Ashland with the story of a bright light, I reported the incident to the Air Force.
