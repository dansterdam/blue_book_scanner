11-9-57 - I noticed while standing in the backyard of my home at about 10:30 p.m. that there were several unidentified bright lights or objects in the sky moving rapidly in various directions. They appeared to change in color from white to red. The objects seemed to be very high in the sky but much closer than the stars. I watched them for several minutes as they zipped through the sky, sometimes appearing to change direction suddenly. They seemed to be larger than stars and not blinking as aircraft lights do. I have no idea what they were but they were strange and different from anything I have ever seen in the sky before.
