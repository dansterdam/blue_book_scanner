The image contains a page from what appears to be a Project Blue Book document. It does not contain any photograph, but rather a sketch showing the motion of an object or objects, as well as a compass diagram.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object or objects appeared to rise above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass to show the direction (azimuth) when you first saw the object. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction (azimuth) from where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

27. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Certainly more  
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
