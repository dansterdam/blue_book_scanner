1. Attached is a letter forwarded to this office from a Mr. Uh..., the content of which is self-explanatory.

2. On 14 July 1964, a resident of Franklin, Mass., telephone CLibson 3-3234, claims that he sighted UFO's on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, 28 July and 29 July 1964 respectively. They were seen on Thursday and Friday evenings in the first week of August. The objects represented lights in the sky. They appeared to be on a variable course, sometimes hovering, sometimes moving rapidly. No other details were provided.

3. A local television program presented a program on UFO's. The Executive Officer of this project and my office were consulted in regard to this, as a result of the inquiry the program was held up for some time because the claimed that she has been spotting these objects over the past three months.
