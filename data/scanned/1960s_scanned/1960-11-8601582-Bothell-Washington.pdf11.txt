AGENCY CASE REPORT

(Case No. 10242, 2 November 1956).

On 12 November 1956, an unidentified flying object was observed from 8:00 P.M. to 9:30 P.M. over Bothell, Washington.

Senator Jackson was notified. Inquiries at the time revealed that the necessary action was taken by the proper military organizations. A copy of the report was forwarded to this office for analysis.

The temporary file shows that the object was reported to be a luminous, flashing, white object at an estimated altitude of 1,000 feet. It was described as being circular in shape, 20-30 feet in diameter and moved in a northwesterly direction at a velocity of about 60 miles per hour.

It is reported that some effort was made to investigate this case. However, since the object was not photographed and no physical evidence was found, the case remains unresolved.

In view of the reported nature of the sighting, it is requested that the report be reviewed and forwarded to the Public Information Office for possible release.

It is requested that the answers to the following questions be provided:

1. What was the shape and size of the window(s)?
2. What is the approximate height of the window(s)?
3. What is the approximate vertical length of the window(s)?
4. How far away were you from the window when you saw the object?
5. Did you move closer to the window while viewing the object?
6. Was the window covered by any other materials?
7. Are there any trees, buildings or other objects in your kitchen window?
8. Please describe in detail what you saw, what the object came close to, what color(s), how it moved, and any other details that you can remember.
