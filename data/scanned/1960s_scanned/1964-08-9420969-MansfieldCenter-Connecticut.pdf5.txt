Extracting the text from the document:

Dear Sir:
About 3 months ago I was sighting outdoors when all of a sudden one of the stars I was watching began to move rapidly. This star or object was no sooner than 20 or 30 feet above the ground. I first thought it was a jet and had been in the same position for more than an hour - a few days later I saw a similar sighting in the same area and with one exception, the object shaped exactly the same. The second time the shape were also in a single motion and were quite similar. It was this happening - a friend of mine was with me. I did not expect to report this until now because  did not seem important. However, I thought you might be interested.

Sincerely,
