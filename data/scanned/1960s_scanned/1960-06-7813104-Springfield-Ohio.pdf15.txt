SDO COMMENT:
Time of sighting around 9:50 pm. Estimated elevation 30 to 45 degrees. However, direction of travel cannot be ascertained definitely. Object moved with starts and stops, and a strange movement which appeared rapid and yet smooth. R-52 seems to have come in from some country region, south of town. Would have photos but camera failed to function. ATTIC USAF SMDO 1957
