Memo for the Record
Sub.: UFO Observation, 25 August 1967
Lt. Jerome people with very commander Memory regarding the unidentified observation of 25 August 1967. A couple of us were watching what was flying around. I didn't call in the range surveillance because at about that time the helmet came in and it came in over the range and it completely slipped my mind about the UFO. It couldn't have been observed for over 45 seconds, it was more or less stationery. I would estimate the object to be 25 or 30 miles from where I was sitting. I personally thought it was an airplane. The airspace was cleared for the Athens but, at times, planes do get in. We had five aircraft in the area at about 40,000 ft altitude. The Athens came in very high and fell from that distance then appeared to fall very slow, a very bright light. Since there are mountains in the background I don't think surveillance radar could have picked it up, they don't do a very good job. The second stage of the Athens looked like a meteor, red in color. the second stage was nearly seconds behind the third stage. The third stage sparked because it still had fuel burning.
