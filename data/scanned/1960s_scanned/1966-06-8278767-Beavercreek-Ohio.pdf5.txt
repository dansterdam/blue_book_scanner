Dear Mr. [redacted],

Please excuse our delay in answering your letter in which you requested information to the Air Force...

Without essential data such as angular velocity, flight characteristics, duration of the sighting, etc., however, a comprehensive evaluation cannot be undertaken. The form you sent to our office has not been returned. If the information requested on the form had been furnished, a detailed investigation would have been undertaken. It is extremely difficult to investigate a sighting which is more than a month or two old.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. I have included the 1967 report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force unidentified flying object program.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Directorate Installations Division
