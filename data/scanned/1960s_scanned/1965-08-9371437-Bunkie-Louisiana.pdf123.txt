1. Reference AFR 200-2 as amended. Francis E. Warren Air Force Base is located in an area which has reported a considerable number of unidentified flying objects. On the night of 31 July and 1-2 Aug, 65, Francis E. Warren Air Force Base personnel observed a number of sightings to the local radio stations. These objects were reliably contacted and alerted to be on the watch for such objects. Following number of sightings were reported during the following three nights:

31 July - 75 objects - observed by 70 personnel
1 Aug - 29 objects - observed by 27 personnel
2 Aug - 44 objects - observed by 26 personnel
Totals 148 objects - 143

2. Description of Objects. Reported objects are mostly round, disc-shaped and silver/silver-white in color. The size ranged from a nickel when seen by the naked eye, and from the size of a pea as observed through binoculars. When observed, they silently moved away in a varying manner from hovering, ascending rapid and slow descents. On August 1st, there was one daytime report, from a civilians account, of two objects travelling in a straight line and disappearing in separate directions. There were no discernible features. 

3. Description of Observation. The early observations were somewhat incidental and perhaps incomplete. Subsequent observations were the product of intentional surveillance prompted by earlier reports.
