The image contains several schematic diagrams and maps, but no photographs. The diagrams appear to be topographical maps or aerial surveys, depicting landscape features such as terrain contours, bodies of water, and other geographical information. There are also some grids of text or numerical data, which seem to be meteorological or other technical data related to the maps.
