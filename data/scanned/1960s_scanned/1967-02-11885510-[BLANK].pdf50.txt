The form of the function f(tc) depends upon the point of
view with regard to the time span of a civilization.
If tc <= T,
then f(tc) = tc
If tc ~ T,
then f(tc) = T - tc
where To is the time between the formation of a planetary system
and the appearance of a technologically developed civilization
on it.
Assuming the lifetime of a civilization is limited, the
following variables may be substituted into equation (1):
Nk1k2 = between 10^5 and 10^10
P1 and P2 unknown but greater than zero and less than or equal
to one.
f(tc) = tc where T is generally accepted as 10^10
Upon substituting into equation (1) under the premise that
one wishes to calculate the maximum number of civilizations, the
following result is obtained:
Nc ~ tc (2)
