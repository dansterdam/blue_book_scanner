DEPT (UFO) Maj Quintanilla/70916/mhb/19 Apr 68
UFO Observation, March 3, 1968

1. Your letter of March 4, 1968 to Dr. Hynek has been received at the Project Blue Book Office. Unfortunately, in this particular instance, we were unable to obtain enough accurate reports so that the identity of the source of the sighting could be quickly verified. We received reports from Indianapolis, Richmond, Dayton, Xenia, Columbus, Pittsburgh, some small towns in Massachusetts of Pittsburgh.

2. The Space Detection Center, at Colorado Springs, was aware that a place of satellite lights was transpiring our atmosphere and was especially vigilant during this time. Because of visual observations, such as yours, it was determined that this was a recurrent phenomenon, normal in scope, and it was determined to be the remains of a satellite or satellites which apparently failed to reenter properly in some area either over the northeastern United States or southern New York, if the fragment survived reentry. We have not been successful in recovering the fragment, but we are hoping that it will turn up when people start hiking in some of the off beaten trails in that area.

3. On behalf of the Air Force, let me thank you for submitting your report to Project Blue Book. Your report will be added to our satellite reentry behavior data base.
