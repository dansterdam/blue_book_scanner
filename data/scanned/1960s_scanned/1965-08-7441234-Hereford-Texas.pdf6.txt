AF IN 1 55572 (6 Aug 65)
COMMENTS: THE OBSERVER IS BELIEVED TO BE UNRELIABLE BECAUSE
HER REPORT IS NOT CONFIRMED BY ANY AVAILABLE SOURCES. THE
REPORT ITSELF WAS VAGUE IN DESCRIPTION. "OFF IN THE DISTANCE"
WAS HER ESTIMATE OF HOW FAR AWAY THE OBJECT WAS. HER ESTIMATION
OF THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT SEEMED INACCURATE. AT FIRST SHE
PAGED RUWJAA 1926 UNCLAS 
THOUGHT IT WAS AS BIG AS A BASKETBALL HELD AT ARMS LENGTH. SHE
LATER STATED: "WELL, MAYBE IT WAS ONLY AS BIG AS A GRAPEFRUIT".
AN OBJECT "OFF IN THE DISTANCE" OF THIS SIZE WOULD BE ENORMOUS,
AND ITS IMPACT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN NOTICED. NO SUPPORTING
INFORMATION CONCERNING AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA COULD BE OBTAINED.
THE TOWN OF DIMMITT LIES ABOUT 16 MILES SW OF THE OBSERVERS
POSITION ON THE APPROXIMATE PATH OF THE SIGHTING. THE OBJECT
REPORTED MAY HAVE BEEN A METEORITE.
