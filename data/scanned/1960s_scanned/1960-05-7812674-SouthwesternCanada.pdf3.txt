Analysis and Conclusions: The object vs the case appears to be a probable meteor, since it disappeared suddenly as meteors do, and the description of the object is consistent with the characteristics of a meteor. The fact that it was observed fora considerable length of time Is not inconsistent with a meteor, as some meteors can be seen for a longer duration depending on their brightness and speed of travel.
