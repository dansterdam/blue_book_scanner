Scattered white blobs of light appeared to darting around in the sky, changing direction and speed. They would appear and disappear at times. It seemed to float or drift rather than move in a steady straight line flight. The lights did not seem to be attached to any solid object that could be seen. The lights reminded me of a light scattered and reflection on water, like when sunlight glimmers on water's surface.
