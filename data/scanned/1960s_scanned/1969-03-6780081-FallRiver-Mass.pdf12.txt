Text extracted from the document:

"Not seemed of any familiar kind.
A very close observation at a low height.
Darting changing of shape, as tho 'fluttering' at high speed.
The center, as the 'body', seemed to contain some 'opening' or 'windows'.
All of the object well lighted from within, as tho 'glowing'.
Disappeared rapidly and silently, upward and forward.
All of the incident would have been covered by the match head."
