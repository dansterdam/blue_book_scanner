Subj: UFO Sighting of 3 March 1968

Called Rochester Control Tower at 1300 hrs. and talked to Mr. C. Brundage, Area Chief, 716-436-5088. He checked all available records. No one in the Tower saw anything. No reports were called in (in that time area). Note: The midnight to 4 shift received report of a sonic boom in early morning hrs. but SAC was operating in the area. Also I checked the radar log but the results were negative. He will call us collect if he hears anything that might help us.
