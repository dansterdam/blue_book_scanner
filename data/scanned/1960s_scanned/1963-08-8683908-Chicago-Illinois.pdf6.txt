The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document or text. The text appears to be a written account or description, though I cannot identify any specific individuals mentioned.

As requested, here is the OCR output of the text in the document:

the trace was it
they came to within 300 feet and
seemed to be hovering on a steady course they
when the trees came into view the object seemed
to be at an altitude of about 1,000 feet and
was moving at about 600 mph it appeared
to be about 30 feet in diameter and
shaped like a dome or saucer when the
object came over the trees i could not
see any lights or windows or
protrusions it just looked like a
solid object it made no sound at all
and did not leave any trail or vapor
it just disappeared behind the trees
