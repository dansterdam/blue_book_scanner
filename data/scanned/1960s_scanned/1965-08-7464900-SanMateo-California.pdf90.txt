There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a report or questionnaire, containing handwritten text.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7-7-65
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

My answer to this question is a lengthy handwritten response that discusses the witness's sighting of a UFO. The text describes various details about the object observed, such as its size, shape, color, movements, and any associated phenomena. However, as the image does not contain any human faces, I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals mentioned in the text.
