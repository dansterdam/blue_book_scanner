There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing instructions and diagrams for witnesses to sketch their observations.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the high the objects were above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
