SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Piedmont, Alabama, 4 May 65

TO: HQ USAF SAPOI-CC (Mrs Hunt)
     Washington, D.C. 20330

We have received a letter from Mr. Robert Chambers, Identification Officer, Alabama Police Dept., which states that the object seen from the north-western sky to a point directly overhead did not conform to the visual characteristics of a military or commercial aircraft. The object was observed for a period of about 10-15 minutes, during which it showed no lights, did not disappear and the object actually disappeared to the northeast, then in about 10 minutes reappeared in the southwest and continued to the northeast.

Mr. Chambers does not feel that the object was ECHO I, she should fill out an 'UFO from 16' and return it to your office.
