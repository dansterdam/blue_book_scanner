The image appears to be a handwritten document with no photograph present. As an OCR system, I will transcribe the text found in the document:

"length of time they could be kept in the air. Strange maneuvers seemed to be made by the little lights overhead. a maneuverable disk or craft as some of the objects were called. none of these was commented upon any control authority, line of sight indicated position and movement. as far as we could determine, there was no characteristic shape or configuration that could be relied upon to identify such objects in the future. the sightings of course covered only a brief portion of the actual time the objects were in the air. some appeared in the early evening and remained visible until dawn the next day. a portion of the objects seen appeared to move about independently, not in formation. no photograph or other physical evidence was obtained, although efforts were made to obtain such evidence. the sightings were so brief, unexpected, and generally at night that obtaining photographic evidence was extremely difficult. we must caution that due to the uncertain nature of the sightings and the almost complete lack of reliable physical evidence, it is difficult to make any definite identification or evaluation. the reports indicate that the objects were quite real and were seen by competent observers, but further research seems essential before any firm conclusions can be drawn."
