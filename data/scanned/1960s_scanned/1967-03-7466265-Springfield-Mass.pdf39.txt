Dear Lt. Marley,

My name is ________. I am 13 years old. I am a student at George Dewey Junior High School, Bremerton, Washington. I have quite an interest in the UFO's. I am writing because I would like to make sort of a study on UFO's. I am writing because I would like you to send me some pictures or some information of some kind of UFO's. You probably busy but if you could find time to do this I would appreciate it very much.

I will tell you about my experience with a UFO. One night about 9:45 about March 20,1967 my friend and I were out looking through my telescope at a star in the west. I was about to go in and get a higher powered lens I looked over into the east and saw some kind of object. I called my friends attention to the object. We both were scared. It made no noise that my friend or I could hear but my dog stared in the direction of the object and started to whimper and bark. The object was illuminated but we still could not see the outline of the object. It flickered and seemed to take sharp turns. It traveled at about 5 or 600 miles per hour. It hovered over a tree for about 15 seconds and then shot up and disappeared. I went in and told my mother about it after that. I wanted to call the police or the nearest A.F.B. but my mother wouldn't let me. That's the story.

Yours truly,
