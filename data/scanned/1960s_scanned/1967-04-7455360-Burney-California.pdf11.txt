But to get to the point, this does not concern me directly. My concern is in the contract. I can find nothing in the contract to cover the situation where I find myself obliged to event "looking under the bed" techniques. I will depend upon counsel to determine how much latitude I have in that respect, no matter what the work, whatever it may be.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
