34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 8 AUG 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire:
(1) 7:48 a.m. Aug. 8, 1966: 4 bright circular yellowish objects, about 30 to 60 feet in diameter, moved silently in a north to south direction at about 2000 ft. altitude.  No vapor trails, no noise audible, very little maneuvering.  They gave the appearance of being under intelligent control.  The objects were in sight about 45 seconds.  At approximately 8:05 a.m., 2 similar objects passed overhead, traveling from east to west at an estimated altitude of 40,000 ft.  The objects appeared to be fluttering and glittering as they moved.  The objects did not have the appearance of any known aircraft.
(2) I also observed the body.  It was a small object, perhaps 3-4 feet in diameter, which appeared to be drifting down very slowly at an angle of about 45 degrees.  It was a greyish-white color and did not appear to have any external features.  It descended behind some trees and was not seen again.
(3) For over a mile as I drove along the highway, the objects remained in sight at all times, and were often seen in the right front side of the windshield.
(4) I was asked secretly by the base commander over which I was very much exercised.
