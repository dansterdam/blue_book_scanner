I tried not to get excited for it would not cause a commotion. I like to keep things like this to myself. My wife doesn't know about it and I don't want to tell her anything. I was just sitting there in my living room when I noticed something in the sky. Then it suddenly changed direction towards me. It came to within 100 to 150 feet above the plant, 200 to above the ground. It stayed there about 30 minutes. The object itself was round, like a puff of smoke, and was soundless. I'm not the type who sees a flying saucer and calls it a flying saucer. I would like to know your opinion on what you think or saw was witnessed. Your name can be given.

Sincerely Yours,
