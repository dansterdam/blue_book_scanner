The image contains no photographs, only sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a "A" and "B" marked on it, representing the angle of an object above the horizon. The second and third sketches depict a person standing on a road, with the third sketch showing a smaller version of the road scene.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" of its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
