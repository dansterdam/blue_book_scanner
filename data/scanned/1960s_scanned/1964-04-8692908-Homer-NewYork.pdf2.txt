There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. government program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document is as follows:

This whole episode took place in about forty-five minutes and ended in about thirty. However, the fact that all four stars attraction. However, the enclosed clippings are what prompted me to write to you relative to the New sighted at an altitude of 15,000 feet. I must admit that the report from there sounds wierd, but during World War II I was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force and all my flying experience was within the Continental limits of the United States. In all that time I never once, night or day, observed anything unusual in the skies. Now, at age 43, I have observed phenomena which are beyond my comprehension, and which has created in me a sense of reasoning and credulity.
