SUBJECT: UFO WITNESS PROFILE REPORTS FOR SEPTEMBER - DECEMBER 1968
DATE: 8 JANUARY 1969

Enclosed are UFO Witness Profile Reports for the months September 1968 through December 1968 inclusive. An Annual Witness Profile Report is also included in your correspondence for 1968.

The UFO Witness Profile Reports are not surveys but rather are a means by which one can quickly obtain a summary of the type of witness submitting UFO Reports to the NICAP MASS SUBCOM. The witnesses are referenced to their respective UFO Reports by filing numbers in order that further information might be obtained.

Present Education means a distinct educational unit presently held by the witness. A unit must be fully completed before one is given credit. For example, a person might be listed as having completed a degree but not yet been awarded. Due to space limitations there is no distinction between the degrees.

The Occupation Other covers a variety of "other than" professional licenses. Encircled items connected by lines indicate occupation/experience qualifications, i.e., one might be an Engineer but hold a private pilots license.

Respectfully submitted,

RAYMOND E. FOWLER
