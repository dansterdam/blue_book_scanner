HARRY GLADIS, 15 December 1968.
Pase 37, Col. 2-3: 
THE RESIDENTS OF THORSHOHN STILL SEE STRANGE LIGHTS.

Strange lights were again seen to the south of Thorshohn at six in the evening of 15 December 1968. According to the observations, the lights were bright like light bulbs and were hovering at an altitude of about 150 meters. A policeman, who took photographs of it, but the developed film showed no images. The lights were seen for about 10 minutes and then disappeared to the south.

The lights were also seen by several other people of Thorshohn and Thorstein, who took photographs of them, which were, according to their statements, very clear. The film of these photos, however, must be about as good as the policeman's, since it has not yet been developed yesterday.

Thorstein Bjarnason, who had first seen the light at about 17.15 hours at night before last, near the birch at the edge of the wood, told that the light was only visible for a very short time and then disappeared to the west at the same place. It seems that these occurrences of strange lights are connected with Thorshohn and the disc must be about as good as the policeman's, since it has not yet been developed yesterday.

The description of this light had been independent of the wind. Thorstein also said, that the light had been seen more clearly before yesterday than it was last Wednesday.
