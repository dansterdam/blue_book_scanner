The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an old document from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be a letter addressed to the Secretary of the Air Force in Washington, D.C. from a resident of Anchorage, Alaska, reporting sightings of strange objects flying around the area and requesting any available literature on the subject.

Text from the document:

Dear Sir:
I am a resident of Anchorage, Alaska. We have reports of strange objects flying around our area. Any information on the sightings, would you please let me know.
Also, if you have any literature at all of U.F.O.s, would you please send some to me.
Sincerely,
[redacted]

Anchorage, Alaska
The Secretary of the Air Force
