SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
PLACE: Rome, New York
DATE: February 6, 1960

On 6 February 1960, a pilot of a Mohawk Airlines plane reported observing an unidentified flying object while in flight near Rome, New York. The report was forwarded to Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation of UFO sightings.

According to the report, the pilot stated that he observed a bright light, reddish in color, which appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before it disappeared from view.

The report also indicates that the pilot felt the object was under intelligent control, as it appeared to make abrupt changes in direction and speed. No other witnesses were reported, and no other aircraft were in the immediate vicinity at the time of the sighting.

Project Blue Book investigators examined the pilot's report and determined that the sighting could not be easily explained by any known or conventional aircraft or natural phenomena. The case was classified as "unidentified" in the Project Blue Book files.
