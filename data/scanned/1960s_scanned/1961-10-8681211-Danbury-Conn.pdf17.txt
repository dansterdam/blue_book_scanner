Dear Major Coleman, Jr.

I am sorry on the delay of answering your question about this matter. You have to realize that we could not give further information on this subject, and myself have answered these questions sheets as good as I could consult some information on these details. We are still very interested in this matter and would be very grateful on hearing of any opinions you might have on this subject.

During the elapsed period of time I have somehow misplaced your enclosed envelope. would it be possible for your office to forward it?

Very truly yours,
