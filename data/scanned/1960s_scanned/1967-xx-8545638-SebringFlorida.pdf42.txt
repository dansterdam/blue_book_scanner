Gentlemen:

I live at the central part of the city of Sebring, Florida. At approximately 6:15 P.M. on January 25 my wife was driving home from our hotel and she saw a bright, pulsating object through the house.

She came into the house and spoke to me of this, and although at first I didn't believe it, I finally went outside to look at it.

The object was approximately 150 west of due south, and about 15Â° above the horizon. It was rounded object in the sky by far exceed for the flares which were being dropped on the bombing range, which is east by north of us. Of course, it was much brighter than the moon, but it was brighter than the brightest star.

I see it, too. The object pulsed white, red, and then either blue or green. We could not be sure which. The pulsations were not a constant frequency, but were very apparent.

We called out our neighbors, Ann Kahn, and our other neighbors, also saw it. By this time, several autos were stopped in the street to telescope and inspect the object, all of which were just as amazed as we were. The object was seen at its disappoint and got no brighter than the brightest star. It would sometimes move out of the field in approximately one minute. When it would disappear, it only over a tree several hundred yards away. We could then move off in an easterly or westerly direction and line it up over another tree. This, of course, led me to believe that the object was quite distant at the time we were taking these particular observations.

I wanted to provide this information to your department for its file, as I am sure you may be interested in this happening.

Sincerely yours,
