SUBMITTED BY: FTD LT COL R. J. FRIEND

I. PURPOSE
To identify the sample and its origin.

II. TECHNICAL DATA
1. The sample was assigned Physics Laboratory serial number 10023.
2. The sample was photographed to show its dimensions.
3. The sample was examined:
   a. For radioactivity using a scintillation counter. No radioactivity.
   b. By emission spectrochemical methods. The composition of the three different phases were identified. The spectrochemical analysis provided these data: Estimated concentrations in weight percent:
   (1) Silica 20%  (7) Calcium 1%
   (2) Aluminum 10%  (8) Potassium 0.1%
   (3) Sodium 4%  (9) Manganese 0.1% 
   (4) Iron 2%  (10) Chromium 0.01%
   (5) Magnesium 2%
   (6) Titanium 1%
4. X-Ray Spectrochemical Methods.
Analyses were performed on samples identical for sample taken from the core and from the outside layers. The major constituent in both cases was crystalline SiO2.
