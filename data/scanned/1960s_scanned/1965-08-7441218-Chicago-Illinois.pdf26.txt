COMMENT: I feel that what I was observing was the Boeing 727 that crashed into Miss XXXX on August 16, 1965. As I understand after talking to R.C. Jansen (FAA - CS-ACCO 33), the last contact with the airliner was at about 0117 GMT on 16 August on Frequency: 123.5. The airliner was last seen on radar by Miss XXXX who was an eye-witness to the last moments of this airliner.
