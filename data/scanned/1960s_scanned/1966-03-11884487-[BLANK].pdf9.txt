State Flying Object Report
Bring Plea for Federal Sift

I Ann Arbor, Michigan .................................................... February 22, 1966

U.S. Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen:

I am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter I have sent to the Chief of the Air Force Material Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, requesting a Federal sift of the contents of the file maintained by the United States Air Force on unidentified flying objects in the possession of Project Blue Book.

I believe there are in this file many reports and other data which, if made available to reputable research agencies, might enable them to contribute substantially to the scientific understanding of this baffling phenomenon. I am especially concerned that the full facts in this important area of scientific investigation should be brought to public attention in an objective and authoritative manner.

I hope you will give this request your prompt and sympathetic consideration.

Sincerely yours,

Frank Mannor, San Decrific UFO
