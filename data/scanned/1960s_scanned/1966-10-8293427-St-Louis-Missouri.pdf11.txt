P NRS 6 - 35 mm Color Transparencies, 6 B&W 8 x 10 Prints, 6 - 35 mm B&W Negatives

1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to answer Work Order Number 67-12 submitted by
Major R. J. Quintanilla, Jr. for an analysis and determination of the objects' identities, if
possible.

2. ANALYSIS:
a. Slides #1 & #7, from Mr.______, appear to be as follows: #1 is a normally
exposed good quality transparency with one water spot or chip in emulsion probably caused
in processing. #7 may also be a good transparency, highly magnified. It may also be some
object or reflection of some shape other than shown, but made to appear as two lobes with
high light and shadows by the extent of close-up focus. The higher the magnification, the
more focus can alter the image size and shape. The image on slide #7 could be of an object,
a light source, or a reflection of a light source. Any identification from the available information
is strictly speculation.

b. Slides #10, and #11, from Mr.______, were taken in the hours of near darkness
and slides #12 and #13 were taken in daylight. All four of these slides appear to have been
taken through the same window and nearly along the same azimuth. Slide #10 shows what
appears to be a light source above the horizon. Slide #11 shows the same light source, with
a similar light source, on a similar subsequent light path. Both of these positions,
dependent on the time duration, appear to represent motion or travel. A slower shutter
speed on frame #11, as compared to #10, would produce a lighter transparency, capture more
of the movement of the object and make the object or image appear longer. These conditions
have been met in frame #11 which is of lighter density and has a longer image. An aircraft
landing light could produce such images.

C. Slides #12 and # 13 show linear patterns such as of smoke, gas, vapor or exhaust
trails. These patterns appear in approximately the area as the lights or reflections in slides
#10 and #11. The linear patterns of the object in slides #12 and #13 are nearly parallel to the
apparent movement of the light in slide #11. The similarity of implied motion in three of the
four slides, #11, #12, and #13, suggests numerous objects traveling in the same area and
same direction. Such as traffic on an airport approach or airway.
