STATEMENT
UFO Sighting

I, David R. Hunt, at about 0255 on the morning of the 3rd of September, received a call from Patrolman Bertrand to report to an area about 3 miles South West of Exeter, N.H. Upon arriving at the scene, I observed a group of bright lights to the South East. After observing the lights for several minutes, they began to drift off in a Northerly direction. The lights remained at the same altitude which I estimate to be about 100-150 ft.
