The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a text description of a "Venus-Jupiter Conjunction" that occurred on November 12, 1960. The text describes the event as involving two bright objects, perhaps stars or planets, that were visible in the sky at that time.

VENUS-JUPITER CONJUNCTION
On the evening of November 12, 1960, I
was able to observe the conjunction of Venus and
Jupiter. This conjunction was extremely close and
the two bright objects were very close together in the
sky. Venus was on the left and Jupiter was on the
right. The two objects were so close together that
they almost appeared as one object. The conjunction
was observed for several minutes and their position
did not change appreciably over the time the
observation was made.
