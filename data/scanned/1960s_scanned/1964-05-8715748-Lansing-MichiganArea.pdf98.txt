17 Jun 64, summary of conversation between Frank Hand reporter, Landing, Michigan and Capt. o and Sgt. Moody.
What is happening in regards to Grand Lodge sightings?
Two sightings ! & 2
1. Was an interrupt
2. A reflection from fog.
1. Between two and three on the night of the sighting IFR flights in that area were diverted to Lansing towers. They were notified by Detroit. This was a classified radar project. Roger Snowberger was in tower at Lansing. Said he saw lots of plans. 'These were all low level flights.'
2. Very intuitive. Just a hypothesis, but reasonable, a swamp on one side, plowed field on other, weather everything matches up to be a reflection off of the fog.
Asked him to send us a copy of his article which he will do.
These sightings, are they pretty much par for the course. 'Yes, it is etc... Do these sightings run in cycles.' Yes, weather has been right for it, summer time. Quite a bit of activity intriques the peoples curiosity making more.
FYI the tower operators at Lansing get quite a few calls themselfs no they just go check and answer them at a time of call. Usually Venus, meteors, etc.
1. Flight over Grand Ledge was at 3 am Fri morning, 20 May 64. Equipment had turbine motor that made a whine noise which dropped out noise of a/c engines. Are we ever told, say New Mexico, more information of what really was? We have to know usually and no long as they say there was no something over that area little that description we leave it at that.
