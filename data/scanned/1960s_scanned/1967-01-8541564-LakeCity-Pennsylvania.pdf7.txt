"201 seemed to be moving at the to the town of a Polk at a Lake City reported to have visited a Look and let them. They said that they seen the object stop, and that they could see it very plainly in the distance. The object would not be avon at through a 6 inch field glass and that the object seemed to be the size of a quarter held at arm's length. We moved up one of the observers but I got it back for a few minutes. Later a large cloud came in front of the moon. It was about 3 minutes when the cloud disappeared and then the object was nowhere in sight of the telescope. We looked for it in the area but could not find it. We do not know what happen to it. I am, greatly interest ed in the object of U.F.O."

P.s - These were reliable witnesses, in my opinion.
