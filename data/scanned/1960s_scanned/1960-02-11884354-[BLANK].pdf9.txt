Text from the document:

Smithsonian Institute, in the instance of suspected meteoritic impacts, in other cases it should only be necessary for the air force to collect the scope films to RADC.

3. Before the USRO program could be discontinued as a special project, the public would have to be educated to accept this new philosophy. The following information would have to be brought to their attention:

a. The USRO's primary interest in UFO's is to determine their threat potential and/or military value.

b. Positive determination of the causes for all sightings is desirable, but the complete ban this would require severe curtailment on and extension of the USRO budget.

Probable causes for sightings based on limited information should be accepted:

d. The Air Force should not be required to disprove the claims of independent UFO organizations or investigators that sightings are due to interplanetary space vehicles.

e. If, contrary to our suggestion, the UFO program is continued as a special project:

a. The UFO project office be divorced from any connections with intelligence and security.
b. The project office be staffed with personnel who have the proper background to analyze sightings, conduct the investigations of significant incidents, and to conduct an effective public-relations program.

A public education program designed to allow discontinuance of the program as a special project after a specified time period, be a part of the mission of the project office.
