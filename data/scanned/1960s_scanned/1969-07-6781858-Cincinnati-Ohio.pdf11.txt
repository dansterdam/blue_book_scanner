The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text. The text appears to provide instructions for a survey or experiment related to the "angular size" of an unspecified object. The instructions ask to hold a match at arm's length in front of a "known object" and estimate what fraction of the object's size the match covers.

The text in the image is as follows:

"Draw a picture that will show the shape of the phenomenon. Include and label any details that night give indication as to the phenomenons origin.

What was the angular size, held a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a streetlight. Note if you have been able to perform this experiment at the time of the sighting. Estimate what fraction of the phenomenon would have been covered by the match head.
