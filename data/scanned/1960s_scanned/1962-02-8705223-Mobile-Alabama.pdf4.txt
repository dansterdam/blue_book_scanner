Mr. who is a commercial fisherman, indicated that he had been a fisherman all his life and that he had observed many natural phenomena in the sky; however, he had never seen anything comparable to the object that he had observed on this date. He said the object appeared to be reflecting sunlight and that it was a very brilliant object - after the sun has set. However, he stated none of these would explain the present phenomena.

Mr. on the other hand, indicates he has never really observed anything in the sky that this object was observed.

The 93rd Radar Squadron, which is located at Dauphin Island, was contacted and they indicated that they did not pick up anything on the radar screen at the time this object was observed. Further, no other witnesses observed this object.
