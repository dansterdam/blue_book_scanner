TDPE (UPO) Maj quintanilla//70916/mha/7 Dec 67
UFO Observation, Burney, California, 19 April 1967

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office has recently received several inquiries regarding the UFO sighting from Burney, California on 19 April 1967. As a result, we are re-investigating the case.

2. Request information on the specific type of radar on which the object was painted. What was the location and course of the object, if so, what were they? What is the period of time for an antenna rotation?

3. It has been proposed that the target which was picked up on your radars could possibly have been a truck. A map of the area indicated that there are mountains in this vicinity with elevations which could have caused the object to have been painted by the radars? If so, is this considered routine for your station?

4. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
