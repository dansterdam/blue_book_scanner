The image contains a compass diagram and instructions for drawing a picture to show the motion of an observed object or objects. There is no photograph present in this particular page from the Project Blue Book document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the skyline to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "G" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
