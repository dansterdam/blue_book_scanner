The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, likely from 1967, containing a form with questions and responses about a UFO sighting.

The text from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It sure did as it went way up, then it was gone.

15. Did the object move fast, or slowly, at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one):   Yes      Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one):   Yes      Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what

18. We wish to know the details, etc. Hold a match stick or man's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object it covers. If you had performed this experiment, what percentage of the match or man's length would the object have covered?
about 1/2 the length of match almost.
