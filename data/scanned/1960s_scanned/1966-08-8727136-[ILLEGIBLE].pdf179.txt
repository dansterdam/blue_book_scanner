Sandlawn
Muskegon, Michigan
Sept 9, 1953
Dear Sir:
May I please report that in regard to the unidentified object seen by my wife, Hazel, and myself, over our home here in Muskegon, on August 30, 1958.
This object first appeared in the east, about 8:45 p.m. and was visible for about 10 minutes, when it suddenly disappeared. It was a round, glowing object, about the size of a large dinner plate, and was in view at an approximate elevation of about 45 degrees. There was no sound accompanying it.
We had a very good view of it, and I have sketched it on the enclosed sheet as accurately as possible. We would be interested to know if any other reports of this or similar objects have been received. If so, we would appreciate any information you may have on such sightings.
Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
