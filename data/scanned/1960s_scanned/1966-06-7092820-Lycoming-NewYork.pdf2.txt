Dear ____, We have noted your letter regarding your unidentified object observation reported to ___ General Counsel as of June 3, 1966 at 0400 hrs. Venus was observed at the time. It is estimated by 25 degrees. In the spring and summer months, Venus is frequently observed by many people well after sunrise or before sunset. At that hour, Venus is low on the horizon. It has been observed by many, particularly due to the increase in density of the atmosphere near the earth's surface.
