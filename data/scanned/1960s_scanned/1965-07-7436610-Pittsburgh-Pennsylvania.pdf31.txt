UFO'S PHOTOGRAPHED OVER BUENOS AIRES

BUENOS AIRES (UPI) - An unidentified flying object was photographed over the Rio Plata, the 35-mile wide river that divides Argentina and Uruguay, spotted by several individuals on Friday. The object, which was described as disc-shaped and white in color, hovered over the Argentine capital situated across the river from Montevideo, for 10 minutes before disappearing. Members of the staff at the Santa Maria Airport in the Argentine capital observed the object on Friday as they reported sighting to the airport manager. Airport authorities said the object was observed for 10 minutes while the individual white object was videotaped to observe the objects. However, no success was reported. Several persons reported spotting unidentified flying objects over Buenos Aires shortly after sunset Friday, they described the objects, some of which were photographed, as clear-shaped and emitting red and green lights, careening from high speeds to hover.

During the period that the flying objects were seen over Buenos Aires, the broadcasting of one of the city's television stations was interrupted because of atmospheric interference.

The government observatory of San Miguel, Argentina, reported, however, that it had not recorded any atmospheric disturbances at the time.
