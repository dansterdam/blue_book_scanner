WITNESSES: Redacted, Massachusetts 
DATE: 6 October 1964
PLACE: Haverhill, Massachusetts

The text in the document is as follows:

Haverhill was driving his car with several passengers when something bright and flashingglided across the road in front of the car. The object was brightly luminous, about 10-12feet in diameter, and seemed to be under intelligent control. It made several sharp, right-angled turns at a speed estimated to be about 1000 mph. The object shot off towardSalem, New Hampshire at a tremendous speed.

EVALUATION: I have found nothing to discredit this sighting. The witnesses were convincing and seemed reliable. Their description of the object's maneuvers and speed are consistent with other reports I have seen, and cannot be easily explained. There may be important details other thanthat presented.
