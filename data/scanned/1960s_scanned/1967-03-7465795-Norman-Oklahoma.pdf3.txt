The image contains a diagram with instructions for the observer to follow. There is a compass rose, a horizon line, and an object depicted above the horizon line. The instructions ask the observer to indicate the position and direction of the object using the compass and horizon line.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the

show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it. Place on "C"
when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were
