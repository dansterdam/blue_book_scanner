OCT 11 1966

Dear Mr. and Mrs. _____

Reference is made to your unidentified observance on June 25, 1966, which was made with the Federal Aviation Agency at the Akron-Canton Airport for information regarding the sighting.

The Goodyear Aerospace Corporation in Akron, The FAA informed us that the Goodyear Blimp was airborne during the period of the sighting. 

We, in turn, contacted Mr. ______ for the Goodyear Company and provided the following information:

On June 25, the Goodyear blimp was flying the normal running lights that are required by the FAA and radios with the ground tower. The blimp attained an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet and was in the air until 11:30 P.M.

We were puzzled that such a craft would be flying at night, but the blimp was in the air until 11:30 that night. According to techniques such as this are often made by persons because of the lighting configuration and because of the movement of the craft. Your wife observed this blimp, especially since it was illuminated with the lighting configuration used by the Goodyear Blimp.  

We wish to thank you for reporting your observance to the Air Force and to assure you we do not release information concerning these matters without authorization.
