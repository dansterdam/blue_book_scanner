There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, containing a questionnaire with two questions:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The page is mostly blank, with the questions and spaces for responses.
