South Dade's UFO Probed
By GERRY CROSBY
The recent increase in reported sightings of UFO's (unidentified flying objects) may possibly result in South Dade's own University of Colorado UFO investigation, being sponsored by a grant from the Air Force.
NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) has completed a study of the sightings in the South Dade area, carrying on a study of UFO reports made to the growing list of people who have spotted them, according to John B. Hoelscher, a psychologist that South Dade may hold the key to the nation's continuing UFO mystery.
Hoelsberry is closely scientific-minded. Members go into the field, try to prove or disprove who claim they have spotted UFOs, gather the data, and send the reports to Washington D.C. and the University of Colorado.
Hoelsberry visited the Perrine-Homestead area as a result of a "flying saucer" story published August 2 in the Miami Herald. He checked the reports of Everett-Harold Rubrooks, a Jewish Creek. NICAP was also interested in the South Dade sightings, as well as other South Dade persons mentioned in the story.
Hoelsberry's file on South Dade's residents, who have made UFO sightings, is quite impressive. From a ne wstandpoint, NICAP's stand, according to Hoelsberry, is that some of the sightings could not possibly be explained away as conventional aircraft or natural phenomena.
