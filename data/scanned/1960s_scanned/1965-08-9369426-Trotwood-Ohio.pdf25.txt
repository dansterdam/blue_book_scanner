The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page contains a form with two questions:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 18 Aug 65

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The rest of the form is blank, indicating that the witness did not provide any additional information beyond the completion date.
