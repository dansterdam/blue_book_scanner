I was with this particular group in the early part of the evening. I do not remember exactly the time, but it was around 9:45 or 10 o'clock. We were standing in the middle of a cotton field, about a quarter of a mile west of my home. The object was overhead and practically stationary. It appeared to be round or oval in shape, and was giving off a reddish-orange glow. At times we could see it pulsate or throb. It seemed to be at an altitude of about 1,000 feet, or possibly higher. The size appeared to be about 50 to 60 feet in diameter. This object remained in the same general location for at least 30 to 45 minutes, during which time we observed it very closely. At one point, it seemed to diminish in size and brightness, almost as if it was going behind a cloud, but there were no clouds in the sky at the time. After a short time, it regained its original size and brightness. Finally, it just simply faded out, as if it had gone behind something, and disappeared from our view. There was no sound whatsoever associated with this object. I have no idea what it was, and can only describe what I and the others saw. I hope this information is of some help to you.
