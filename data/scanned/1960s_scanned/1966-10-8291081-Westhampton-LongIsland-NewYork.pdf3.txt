Attention, Capt. Craig
605 Dimmick Circle, Apt. C
Westhampton, N.Y.

Dear Sir:

In accordance with our telephone conversation this morning I am sending you a copy that you may forward to your office. Since you feel there is a need for a report of what I have seen and with it a copy that you may forward to your office. 

I think there are a lot of level-headed, none who are seeing unbelievable sightings. If they show contempt of ridicule from the press and radio they may never tell the other hand there are possibly nervous or other who would the other hand there are possibly nervous or other who would the powers that they deserve.

As for myself, I have studied the stars and astronomy for many years to make a hobby of it. I was not in an hysterical frame of mind when I saw what I saw on the evening of September 28, 1966. I was startled and surprised but I believe what I saw.

If the powers concerned wish to take this as a serious case, I shall be glad to cooperate in any way that I can at such time as you may wish to contact me.

Since I am a retired person, I am more or less at your disposal at a moment's notice. I shall be glad to answer any questions with regard to my sighting that you may care to ask.

I believe the Air Force wishes to enter what evidence they can. Sincerely,
