The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document from the Air Technical Intelligence Center of the United States Air Force, dated March 28, 1950.

The text in the document is as follows:

AFOIR-H-22
SUBJECT: UFO Report

1. The objects seen on the evening of 7 March 1950, have been determined to be the remnants of disorganized VIFF satellite, its apparent higher rate of brilliancy over Florida.

2. There seems to be the possibility that we re-entry of the above satellite pattern as witnessed, since the time of sighting is very close to the computed time of disengagement of the objects reported by other witnesses.
