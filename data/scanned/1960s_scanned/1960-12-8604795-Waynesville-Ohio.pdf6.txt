MEMORANDUM FOR AUGUST STAAK:

Subject: UFO

1. On 8 DEC 60 I received a report from one of our intelligence agencies as follows: 14 Dec 60
At approximately 11:35 am, EST, on the above date, a local citizen of Waynesville, Ohio, approximately 30 miles south of Dayton, Ohio, observed a circular object in the sky over Waynesville. The object was approximately 50-60 feet in diameter and had a flat, grey, metallic-like surface. It was observed to make a swift, lateral movement, then stop momentarily, and then continue on a straight course in a southwesterly direction at a very high speed, estimated to be approximately 600-1,000 mph. The object was observed for approximately one minute. Upon further investigation, it was determined that the object did not resemble any known type of aircraft.

2. Though I was not an eyewitness, I feel that the observer's account appears to be credible, and I recommend that this matter be given additional study.
