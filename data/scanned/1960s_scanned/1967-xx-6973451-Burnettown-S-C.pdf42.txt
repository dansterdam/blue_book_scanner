DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENA, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHTED: The object was a red ball of fire that hovered over a field. It appeared to be about the size of a basketball. It then flew off at a very high rate of speed. It was a very brilliant light that was visible for only a few seconds.
