POSITION, TITLE AND COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
Report prepared by Captain Anthony L. Gilliam, AD 509925, D-4, Investigator, stating Des Movers Preparing OFFICER'S comments are as follows:
Miss [REDACTED] and Miss [REDACTED], both gave me the impression of being typical teenagers, shy, fairly intelligent, and sincere in their beliefs as to what they actually saw. Their cooperation, at all times, on answers to all questions put to them, was good. The girls have not questioned apparent since early 1961, having been checked by police.  
Through check of the area of sighting by the investigating officer revealed no additional information. Particular emphasis was placed on several for ground stones or one, banks of mounds, brush or trees, and general directions across the farm and house. The investigation in the area made possible a thorough search, but with negative results.
Before covering information received from Miss [REDACTED], a description of the area leading to the Cratsley house is needed to better understand and evaluate the facts.
The land behind the Cratsley house is level for about ten yards, forming a natural yard. The next hundred yards behind it a a slow, gradual slope and is sparsely covered by brush and weeds. After that the ground rises at a more rapid rate forming a hill roughly two (2) hundred yards from the house.
