The image appears to be a black and white photograph depicting a night sky filled with stars. There are several distinct bright spots or objects visible in the frame, which could potentially be unidentified flying objects (UFOs) based on the context provided. However, I cannot make any definitive claims about the nature or origin of these objects.
