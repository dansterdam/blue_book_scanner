Observer was in his house when he felt the moon getting dark. He looked out and saw an object in the sky. He watched this light for about a minute. The object then began to move across the sky. The object then began to change colors from a red and green light, and appeared to be a bright star when first observed. The witness has seen additional UFOs. The description is consistent with that of an aircraft or aircraft lighting.
