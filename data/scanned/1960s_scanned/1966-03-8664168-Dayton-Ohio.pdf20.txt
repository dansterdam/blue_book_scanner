The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which is a collection of UFO sightings and investigations conducted by the U.S. Air Force.

The text on the page is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? NO

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound NONE
b. Color GREEN DIAMOND SHAPE

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Approx. 1/2 to 3/4 the diameter of the head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the objects that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

(Two sketches are provided showing a jagged shape and an oval shape, with an arrow next to the oval shape.)
