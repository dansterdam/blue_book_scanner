This refers to your unidentified flying object (UPO) observation of January 17, 1967. 

Based on the submitted information, we have evaluated the data and conclude that you were probably observing the planet Venus. On January 17, 1967, Venus was the prominent evening star in the western sky. This is a known astronomical event that would have the characteristics you described.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
