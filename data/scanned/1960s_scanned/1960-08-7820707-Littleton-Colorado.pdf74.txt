Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text in the document:

At 1:45 a.m., 16 August 1960, Sgt. ****** *******'s attention was called to a strange light in the S.E. sky by a neighbor. He observed a large, bright, round, white light which appeared to be about 35-40 feet in diameter. The light appeared to be located a short distance above the horizon, moving slowly in a SW direction. After observing the light for about 3-4 minutes, it suddenly disappeared.

Sgt. ******* reported this incident to the USAF Project Blue Book Office. According to Sgt. ****** "the light was brighter than the evening star, and was definitely not a star or planet. Also, it was moving in a horizontal direction, not rising or setting as a star or planet would do."
