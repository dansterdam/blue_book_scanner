TDM/UFO
Observation of 3 April 1966,
HQ USAF SAFOIC (Mrs Hunt)
Reference the attached letter from regarding an observation made on 3 April 1966. The following is:
a. Dear Mr.
Your report of a UFO sighting in your letter of 23 May 1966 has been received.
As your description indicates, you were unable to observe the object long enough to determine what the source of the lights was.
Unfortunately, the average person is a poor observer. This has been confirmed by many studies done in this field on controlled experiments.
The Air Force wishes to thank you for reporting your observation. No further information was received from the Kalispell AFB for 3 April 1966.
FOR THE COMMANDER
ERIC T. de JONCKHEERE, Colonel, USAF
