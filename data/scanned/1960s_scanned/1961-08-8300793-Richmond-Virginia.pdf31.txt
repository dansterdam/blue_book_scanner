Dear Mr. ####:

In an earlier letter I replied to you concerning the sightings you mentioned in previous correspondence.

The latest Department of Defense release on the subject of UFOs indicates that, I am informed, your case will be several weeks before the new issue sheet is published.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
