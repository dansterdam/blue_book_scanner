The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that contains a questionnaire-style form with various questions and checkboxes related to the observation and description of a UFO phenomenon.

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME? 
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
LIFT UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?  
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?

The document then goes on to describe the observation, stating:
"The illumination. At first it appeared to be a beautiful full moon. Then it was noticed that it was moving across the sky; with this must moving right along with it."

The form then asks how the object finally disappeared, to which the response is "Unknown: The building next door (one shown in sketch to question 7) obstructed view."
