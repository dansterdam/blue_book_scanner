18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. This will give us an idea of the apparent size of the object. It was approrimately the size of a matchhead at arm's length.

Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

There were no protrusions, wings, exhaust or vapor trails. It was a slightly bright light with no clearly defined features.
