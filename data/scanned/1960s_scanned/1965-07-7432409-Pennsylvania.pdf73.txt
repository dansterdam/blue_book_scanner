Area Residents Again Sight 
UFO In Skies Over Dayton

A bright object in the sky over which the National Investigation committee on Aerial Phenomena says it has received reports has again been sighted in the Miami Valley.

The unidentified object was spotted Tuesday night for many area residents, according to sources offered opinions on what it was.

Despite reports of the object and its published articles and television and radio statements, skepticism of unidentified objects being of extraterrestrial origin was increasing recently.

The sightings were reported to be increasing, especially in recent months, a spokesman for the Project Blue Book investigation said the office has not received any reports on sightings in the past two weeks.

"The Blue Book spokesman said that though there are occasional reports, there has been a gradual decline in the number of reports about objects in the sky over Dayton and surrounding areas in recent weeks."

The reports of the object, said to be about 70,000 feet in Ohio and neighboring states, are being investigated.
