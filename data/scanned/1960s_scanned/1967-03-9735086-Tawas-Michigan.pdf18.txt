Addendum: The classification being suggested might be outlined as follows:

Class 5: Object seen in sufficient detail to rule out conventional causes if the description is taken as accurate.
Class 4: Details observed which contradict conventional causes or unidentified in report or observation which could not have conventional explanation.
Class 3: Not enough detail observed to suggest either conventional or unconventional cause; either conventional or unconventional explanation equally applicable.
Class 2: Some unusual aspects to observation, but could be explained by prosaic scene conventional objects present (not, however, in contradiction to witness' statements).
Class 1: Object positively identified as conventional.
