At about 5:30 EST on the evening of January 5, 1966, an unusual aerial object was observed by my wife and myself at our home in Utica, New York. The object was first seen hovering motionless at a point approximately 40-45 degrees above the horizon in a northeasterly direction. It appeared to be brightly luminous, about the apparent size of a full Moon, and was exhibiting a pulsing or intermittent mode of illumination. After hovering motionless for several minutes, the object suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and vanished from sight within a second or two. There was no trail or exhaust visible and the acceleration was far beyond the capability of any known aircraft. I would be glad to provide any additional information that may be desired regarding this incident.
