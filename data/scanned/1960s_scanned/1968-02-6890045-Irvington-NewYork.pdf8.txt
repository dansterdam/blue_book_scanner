I was standing in an open field not too far from my home trying to get a better look at a strange light I had noticed earlier. I did not see the object at first, but after looking around for a while, I saw it straight in front of me, hovering over the trees. It appeared to be circular in shape and very bright. I watched it for several minutes, and it seemed to be moving slowly at first, then suddenly shot straight up and disappeared. I was very surprised by this and went home to tell my family what I had seen. I am curious to know if anyone else in the area reported seeing the same thing that night.
