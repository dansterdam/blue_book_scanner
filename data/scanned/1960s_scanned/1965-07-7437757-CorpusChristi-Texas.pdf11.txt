FTD (TDY)
415 UNION BANK BLDG., OHIO 45433
28 August 1965

To: Mr. and Mrs. CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas

Dear Mr. and Mrs. [Redacted]:

Reference your unidentified flying object observation of 21 August 1965 which you reported to CAME-DO. The information which we have received is not sufficient for an evaluation.

In order to properly evaluate this report, it is requested that you fill out the attached FTD form 154 and return them in the same envelope.

We would particularly like to know:

a. How extensive were the turning and zig-zag motions of the object?
b. When they stopped?
c. How long they were motionless?
d. Were both motionless at the same time?
e. How did both objects initially the same?

A detailed diagram of the motions and the magnitude of these would be helpful.

The Air Force wishes to thank you for your interest in this project.

Sincerely,

VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR
