PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP : 17/1830
2. LOCATION: Bradenton, Florida
10. CONCLUSION: Other: (UNRELIAELE REPORT)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: CONTENTS: It would seem very strange if a 15 yr old boy could watch several disc shaped objects as a pair attempt to reproduce to the ground. It would also seem strange if an object were as low as he reported, in a residential area, and be reported by only one observer.
