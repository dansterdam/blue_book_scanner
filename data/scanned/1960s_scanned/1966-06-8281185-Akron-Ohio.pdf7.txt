Gentlemen:

I know you probably get hundreds of letters like this every day but you certainly are the best of me. My husband and I were returning home from a trip to Tennessee where we dropped off a son off at camp when this situation happened to us.

We haven't told anyone because we thought they would think we were mentally unbalanced. 

We talked about the happening all the way home and weeks after. The was what did the Police Dispatcher (not police office my name) at the Medina Sheriff's Department, but no one had heard anything about it.

I am not ashamed to call you that we were quite scared when this happened. 

I hope there is some logical explanation for what we saw. If not, I would appreciate it if you would let us know what it was. I wish you could please let us know. Also, we would appreciate it if you would not let too many people know our name.
