The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a scanned document with typewritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

A portion of a series of pictures in Tucson, Arizona, late last evening. This page has typed material covering most of the page, leaving little blank space. The text appears to discuss observations and analysis of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).
