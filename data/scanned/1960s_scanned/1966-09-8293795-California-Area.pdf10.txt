There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed letter with text that appears to be a response to a previous letter concerning an unidentified flying object. The text reads:

Proposed reply to letter from 12 May 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This replies to your recent correspondence concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object last fall. 

The information you submitted will be filed for information purposes only since, at this late date, a meaningful scientific investigation is not possible.

Without essential information such as flight characteristics, angular velocity, weather conditions, I am hesitant in making any kind of explanation. It is important that an individual report his or her observation as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force installation.

Thank you for your interest in the Air Force's UFO program.

A Sajovic 31 May 67
