Transcription of the text in the document:

At 1325 hours on 8 January 1967, a UFO sighting was reported to this office by Patrol Sergeant Jones, Illinois State Police. Sergeant Jones stated that at approximately 1320 hours, he and another officer were on routine patrol in the vicinity of Centreville, Illinois, when they observed a bright, metallic, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky above a farm area approximately 15 miles west of their location. Sergeant Jones stated that the object appeared to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter and was approximately 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the ground. He further stated that the object was motionless for several minutes and then suddenly accelerated in a northwesterly direction and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. 

At 1355 hours, this office received a call from an unidentified caller who stated that he had also observed the same object from his residence in Centreville, Illinois. The caller stated that the object appeared to be metallic, disc-shaped, and was hovering in the sky for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing.

It is the opinion of this investigator that the object observed by Sergeant Jones and the unidentified caller was a genuine UFO incident. The descriptions of the object provided by the witnesses are consistent and the sudden acceleration and disappearance of the object are indicative of a high-performance, unconventional aircraft.
