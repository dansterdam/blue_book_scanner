INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
Figure 18 shows a development plan which we feel is feasible, based on our current work in house at Goodyear, and that with the Langley Research Center under the Air Force.
As Mr. Loftin and Mr. O'Sullivan pointed out, we too agree that there are no minor technical breakthroughs required to work toward the constrinction of inflatable structures in space for approximately 10 years. This is not to say that research on inflatable structures and a large number of other areas, but we do feel the direction we are getting now in the structural design of these full scale units does give us a firm basis in this area.
Our plan here would be to work toward vertical shots and then the fabrication of these full scale units. Two of which we would utilize the Mercury capsule for the re-entry of, in this instance, a one-man crew.

This completes my portion of the presentation. Mr. Richardson. One other thing I would like to point out, that I think Mr. Madden overlooked, is it allows the man to get out of his space suit, to take it off after he comes out into the space station, and to work in a normal environment in the space station.
Things like this we have to learn as we go on into space.
