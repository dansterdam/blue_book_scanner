Text in the document:

Last night a witness was traveling along a main road near Albuquerque. New Mexico when he observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared very close and seemed to be moving up and down, as well as hovering at times. The witness described the object as being shaped like an elongated football, and estimated that it was about 50 feet in length. He stated that the object emitted a bright glow and made no sound. He watched the object for approximately 30 minutes before it suddenly disappeared. The witness could not determine how the object disappeared, but stated that it did not simply fly away. The witness also reported that the object appeared to be under intelligent control, and that it made abrupt changes in direction and speed during the sighting. The witness expressed that he was very disturbed by the experience and could offer no explanation for what he had observed.
