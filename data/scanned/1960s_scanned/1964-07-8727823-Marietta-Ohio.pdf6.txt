The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The diagram appears to be a technical illustration of some kind, possibly related to the tracking or observation of an unidentified flying object.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object. Draw an arrow to show how the object was moving when you first saw it. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture to show how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
