LENGTH OF TIME: 43 SECONDS

HOW WAS TIME DETERMINED? When I first saw it I looked at my watch & I saw the time & when I could no longer see it I looked again & recorded the difference in time. The phenomenon was in sight continuously. It was about 43 seconds. Indicate whether you made this time determination by clock, watch, etc.

There was a big flash like that of a big blast & it came up from the ground. The object was hovering about 25 to 30 feet off the ground. It didn't move hardly at all. It was sort of circular in shape & the color looked like burnished metal, like stainless steel. It was about the size of a small automobile. The glow got brighter & brighter then the whole thing just disappeared. The sky was clearing up & the sun was coming out that's why I could notice it better. Other people saw it too. The streak was crossing - the sky. The streak was crossing the sky.
