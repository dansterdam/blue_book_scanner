Dear mr. reason:

reason appear to be a definite and of this part of the sighting. he has to go out and get material for the report, otherwise we will not be able to continue with the investigation ..... look at the picture and the attached information. ihere are more details on the sighting. it would be helpful to have some additional information that may assist in a better understanding.

it does not seem to be a definite out-and-out case that would justify going any further. flashing signal in the sky, watching by the people or the local group. it has to go quiet for sometime and see if it can be resolved.
