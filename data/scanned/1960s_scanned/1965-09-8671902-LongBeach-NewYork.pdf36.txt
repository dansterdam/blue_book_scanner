My sighting was on the night of Aug. 21/22 - 1965. Shortly after 2 A.M. I was awakened by a bright light inside my house. I looked out and saw a large object hovering over the neighboring houses - which appeared to be about 50 ft in diameter. The object was bright with a variable light showing flashing lights around the edge as if it rotated and pulsated. It was silent except for an occasional swishing sound. After about 10 min. it suddenly accelerated and disappeared in a straight line at great speed. I and others in the neighborhood saw this and were quite bewildered by it.

Sincerely
