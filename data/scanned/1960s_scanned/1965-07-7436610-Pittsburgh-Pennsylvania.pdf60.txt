The image does not contain a photograph, but rather two sketches or drawings. The first sketch shows the outline of an object with rays or beams extending from it, and the text states that this represents how high the object was above the horizon. The second sketch shows two aerial views of the same object, with the text indicating that this represents the position of the object as it was first seen and then later seen.
