THE GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THIS SIGHTING INDICATES IT WAS APPARENTLY MADE UP OF TWO DISTINCT PARTS OR OBJECTS WHICH WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND WHICH MOVED IN TANDEM OVER A SHORT SPACE OF TIME. ON 29 SEPTEMBER 1965 A YOUNG AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATOR RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT UNKNOWN OBJECTS HAD BEEN SIGHTED OVER THE EXETER, NEW HAMPSHIRE AREA DURING THE PREVIOUS EVENING, SEPTEMBER 28TH. DETAILS OF THE INITIAL SITING WERE OBTAINED AND IT WAS DECIDED TO CONDUCT AN IMMEDIATE ON-THE-SPOT INVESTIGATION. THIS INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT THE NEXT DAY, SEPTEMBER 29TH, BY THE AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATOR. HIS REPORT INDICATED THAT THE OBJECTS SIGHTED APPEARED AS TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS WHICH HOVERED OVER THE EXETER AREA FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME, MOVED AROUND, AND THEN DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. SEPARATE SIGHTINGS WERE MADE BY AT LEAST THREE OBSERVERS IN THE EXETER AREA DURING THE PERIOD 9:00 PM TO 12:00 MIDNIGHT ON SEPTEMBER 28TH. IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE OBSERVERS WERE RESPONSIBLE RELIABLE CITIZENS WHO HAD NO APPARENT REASON TO MAKE UP OR DISTORT THEIR ACCOUNTS. THEIR DESCRIPTIONS OF THE OBJECTS WERE CONSISTENT AND CORRESPONDED WITH WHAT THE AIR FORCE INVESTIGATOR DETERMINED ON HIS ARRIVAL IN EXETER THE NEXT DAY. BASED ON ALL THE INFORMATION OBTAINED DURING THE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN WERE SIGHTED OVER THE EXETER AREA DURING THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER 28, 1965.
