28 January 1963
Durban, South Africa

On January 9th, 1963, at about 10:40 p.m. a bright light, approximately 1,000 feet in diameter, was observed in the eastern sky. It was sighted for a brief period, particularly clear, and then disappeared. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was accompanied by six smaller objects, each about 200 feet in diameter, that circled the larger one. The smaller objects moved very rapidly and made sudden changes in direction. The light from the objects was extremely bright and illuminated the countryside for several miles around.

Significantly, this sighting was the subject of considerable public interest and discussion and received extensive publicity in the local newspapers for several days. The reporting witnesses included a number of experienced and reliable observers, such as a pilot, several engineers, and other professional persons.

This seems to accurately summarize the key details from the text in the image.
