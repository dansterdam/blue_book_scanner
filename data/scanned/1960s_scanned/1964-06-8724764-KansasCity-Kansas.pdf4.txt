SUBJECT LETTER FROM W. C. JONES - KANSAS CITY, KANSAS
19 January 1964
Subj: Sighting of Unidentified Object
Ref: (a) Your letter dated 18 December 1963
1. In response to reference (a), I am submitting the following information concerning the sighting of an unidentified object on 8 June 1962.
2. The object was sighted at approximately 9:00 p.m. CDT while I was traveling west on Interstate Highway 35 approximately 15 miles south of Kansas City, Kansas. The object was observed for a period of approximately 5-7 minutes.
3. The object appeared to be circular in shape, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and was hovering at an altitude of approximately 1000-1500 feet. The object gave off a steady bright light, almost as bright as the moon on a clear night. There was no visible means of propulsion.
4. The object suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. There was no sound associated with the object.
5. I am enclosing a sketch of the object as I remember it. Although not an artistic rendering, I believe it accurately reflects the general configuration and size of the object as I observed it.
