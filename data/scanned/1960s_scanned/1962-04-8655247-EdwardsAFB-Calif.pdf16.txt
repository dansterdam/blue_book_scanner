Man's 'Pressurability' Tested in Sealed Capsule Experiments

What is the optimum atmospheric composition and pressure necessary for man's respiratory intake and emission are questions being studied in sealed capsule experiments.

The cell is a fabric structure built for three hours to test the effects of varying atmospheric pressures and compositions on the human subject. During these tests, both chambers are pressurized to prescribed limits. The test cell differs only one-half pound of pressure from the external ambient pressure. Aircraft engineers said the purpose was to determine if man can operate in an environment of reduced pressure and see what happens.

The project is part of the 6570th Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. They are concerned with the human limitations of operation in space and other extreme environments.

During testing, both chambers are pressurized to prescribed points. The optimum gaseous atmosphere necessary for the subject's respiratory intake and emission is being studied, along with the effect of various pressure levels.

AF Academy To Get Basic Research Lab

The 3800th Air Police squadron, at the Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, will receive a basic research laboratory. This facility will serve as the primary research laboratory of the School of Aerospace Science. Major research areas will be related to the establishment of a "space laboratory" in support of the training programs.

The construction of the new facility will be accomplished during the current fiscal year, and laboratory equipment valued at over $1 million will be installed. It will provide housing and support for selected members of the Aerospace Research Laboratories including scientists and researchers. The laboratory will be under the direct technical supervision of the School of Aerospace Science.

Martin-Denver Gets Algae Research Lab

The Air Force has awarded the Martin-Denver Division a $1.6 million contract for the establishment of a research facility devoted to the research and development of algae products which conceivably would have military applications. The new laboratory will be located at Denver, Colorado, and will be manned by scientific personnel of the Martin-Denver Division.

The contract provides for the procurement of equipment, facilities, and technical personnel to conduct a complete research and development program relating to the cultivation, processing, and utilization of various algae. Work will be supervised by Dr. G. D. Cliff, Director of the Martin-Denver Biotechnology Center.
