NEW LIGHT ON "FLYING SAUCERS"

"Flying objects" made in a laboratory -- a mass of glowing gas. Washington, March 20 (AWTJ -- The Air Force now believes a laboratory-made "flying object" may be very similar to the real-life "flying saucers" which have been reported world-wide and heatedly debated. 

According to Dr. Forbes and his associates, they have had no formal tests to confirm this theory, but they are studying the matter with utir aost interest.

It is reported that the laboratory model, which is about 2 feet in diameter and glows with an interior purple and yellow light, does manuever in ways similar to the alleged saucers.
The laboratory model pictured here is said to show the interior view, but it is still an experimental object, the scientists say.

They admit that making an object that could be produced by heating some of the gases used in the ammonia-gas experiments... "would be difficult at the present stage of our knowledge."
