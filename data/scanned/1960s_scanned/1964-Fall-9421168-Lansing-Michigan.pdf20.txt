A special review has been made of the U.S. Air Force records of UFO reports, and it has been determined that no air vehicle actually visible and observed during the time period of the new Washington observations could have caused the reported phenomenon which led to the request for this review. The reviews in this document, however, are concerned with the available records and do not represent any reflection on the accuracy or good faith of the observers.
