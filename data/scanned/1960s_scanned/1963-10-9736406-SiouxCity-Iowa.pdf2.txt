"WHAT OBJECT IS IDENTICAL TO WHITISH GREY IT IS ABOUT SIMILAR IN SHAPE TO DOUBLE BEVELLED LENS ITS CENTER IS SLIGHTLY MORE DENSE THAN ITS RIM THERE WAS NO VISIBLE PULSATION NOR MOTION ONLY GLOW OR LUMINOUS EFFECT. IT CAME FROM BEHIND THE BARN AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND BARN AFTER TRAVELLING ABOUT 50 YARDS THE ELEVATION WAS APPROXIMATE 30 ABOVE HORIZON. THIS WAS EASILY VISIBLE WHEN AREA WAS DARK AND AS I APPROACHED CLOSER IT BEGAN TO FADE AND DISAPPEAR.
I WILL TRY AGAIN SOME OTHER TIME TO SEE IF I CAN GET A BETTER LOOK. OBJECT WAS APPARENTLY SIGHTED AGAIN ON 14 SEPTEMBER AND EXAMINED AGAIN UNDER MORE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS. THERE IS A LONG REPORT ON THIS CASE BUT IT IS SO TECHNICAL IN NATURE THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO INCLUDE ALL OF IT IN THIS LETTER IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THIS CASE BE EXAMINED IN DETAIL AS THE OBSERVER IS QUITE RELIABLE AND APPEARS TO BE TELLING THE TRUTH. HIS DRAWING IS ATTACHED HERETO SHOULD YOU WISH TO SEE IT. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THIS CASE."
