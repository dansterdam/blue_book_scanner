The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a handwritten document. Based on the text, the document appears to describe a sighting of a large object that the observer believed to be a satellite. The text mentions the object being observed for 20 minutes with a camera, and that it was a "big object going through delibrate [sic] motion with a very slow speed" until it went into the air force. The document also includes the date "august 13th 1930" and the text "SATELLITE PATH".

Here is the full text from the document, reproduced using OCR:
