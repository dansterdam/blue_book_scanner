PROJECT 10973 RECORD
1. DATE-TIME GROUP: 9/29/62
2. LOCATION: Rocklin, Calif. 
3. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
10. CONCLUSION: Insufficient data for evaluation
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched an object that appeared to be a strange aircraft, descending from above and making maneuvers that appeared to be controlled. As the object descended, it appeared to be a half-dome, smaller than that of a downdraft configuration, and was observed for 30 minutes. The object was not in view during the entire observation period. It appeared to be silently hovering, then moved off in two or three different directions. The description is consistent with that of an unidentified flying object, however, there is insufficient information to make a conclusive evaluation.
