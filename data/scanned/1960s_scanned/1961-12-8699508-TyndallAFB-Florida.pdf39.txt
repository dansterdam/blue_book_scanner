CASE HISTORY

December 8, 1961

On 8 December 1961, the Tyndall AFB, Florida radar site detected an unidentified target. The radar site observed the target moving at approximately 1500 knots at an altitude of 40,000 feet.

The radar operator tracked the target for approximately 5 minutes before it disappeared from the radar scope.

A visual observation was made by the radar site personnel, but they were unable to obtain a good visual sighting due to the high speed and altitude of the target.

The weather at the time was generally clear with no cloud cover.
