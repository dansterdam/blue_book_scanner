We are late 15 year old. Do you head ya mention that you needed sightings that are in a great detail. My friend on May 9, 1961, made a observation in the sky. It was about 5 minutes long. That's about it for matter.

Sometimes in May 1961, I can't remember the day, I saw an U.F.O. It was about 3.55 and I was standing at the intersection at Wantagh avenue and South Drive. It was a bright round object traveling from the north to the south. It had a white stripe running from the nose to the back. It also had shot appeared to be 3 little lights mounted on the underside. I saw the object for about 20 to 30 seconds traveling north to south. It was going pretty fast and then it climbed rapidly steadily then it disappeared. I couldn't believe my eyes, it wasn't straight up and it disappeared. It might, I am enclosing a drawing of the object which I hope will help you in your investigation.
