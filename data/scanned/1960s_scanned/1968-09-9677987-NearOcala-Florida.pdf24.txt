The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document with text describing an apparent UFO sighting.

I remember exactly, I had a 12-mile (it was either 10 or 12 mile) DME reading off of Ocala when we saw this object.
And then, of course, you say it turned to its left then?
That is correct, yes.
Because it had to go west, yes. So it made a right-angle turn to the left, to the west and that prevented it from hitting you, then presumably.
That is correct, yes. At that point I knew it wasn't a missile because they have no control, I understand, over those things once they're gone.
Immediately after it made the 90 degree turn, then what?
It descended.
It descended.
And it continued west and descending and the best we could tell it was either on the ground or very, very close to it.
And did it change in brightness?
Oh yes, when it went away from us, the light was pale green, just like the first one we saw. As it was coming toward us the light was very similar to a strobe between fluorescent light and incandescent light. It had some tint to it, but it was brighter white as it was titled. And, but as it went away it had a green tint, just like the first one.
Well! And about the same brightness?
About the same intensity, yes.
Did it ever blink out, or was it, did it ever seem to twinkle like a star, or blink out,...?
No, it was consistent. As it would go away, its flashing was consistent just like a rotating beacon...
It was flashing, I see, so it was not a steady light, it was a pulsating light.
