The subject reported sighting an object that appeared to be hovering over the west side of Naperville, Illinois, at approximately 8:15 p.m. on January 8, 1962. He described the object as being oval in shape, dark in color, and metallic in appearance, with a row of lights around the perimeter. The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight.

The subject was interviewed by the local Air Force base, and his report was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation. 

This document appears to be part of the Project Blue Book files, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.
