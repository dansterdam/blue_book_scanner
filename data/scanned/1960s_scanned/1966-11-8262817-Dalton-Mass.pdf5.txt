Case history - Dalton, Mass. 8262817 11/8/66
Case summary A - There are two distinct schools of thought on this case. One view sees it as a well-planned and executed hoax, while the other regards it as a genuine, if puzzling, report that merits serious consideration. The initial investigation supports the hoax theory, but a more detailed analysis raises some doubts. The details of the case, as reported, are as follows:
At about 6:15 p.m. on November 8, 1966, two high school students - a boy and a girl - reported seeing a large, luminous object hovering over a field near Dalton, Massachusetts. According to their account, the object was egg-shaped, about 60 feet in diameter, and was surrounded by a glowing corona or "aura" of light. It hovered silently for several minutes and then shot straight up and disappeared.
The students claim that the object was clearly visible and that they watched it for a full 10 minutes before it departed. They reported the incident immediately to their parents, who in turn notified the local police. A police investigation was promptly initiated.
You are actually have not seen these things, then sightings of the area should be started immediately. The actions of these objects are very persistent and most deliberate. However, I will tell you what you are well aware of what is going on from reliable reports. People are actually more who still have their own sighting experiences to report.
