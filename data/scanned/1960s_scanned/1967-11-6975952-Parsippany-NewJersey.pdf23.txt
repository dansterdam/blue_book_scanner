Dear Major:

I am writing this letter in deep concern about the U.F.O.'s. I have been dealing with the subject for quite some time, and I would suggest that you continue U.F.O. investigation. I can supply sufficient information and evidence proving the flying saucers do exist, and that we are being observed by an advanced civilization from outer space, possibly Alpha Centauri. Please answer this letter as soon as possible.
