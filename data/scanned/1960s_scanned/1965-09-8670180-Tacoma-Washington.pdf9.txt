Low-flying space capsule?

A witness object swooping over 
Waikiki Beach, and inspecting houses in
Honolulu, was tracked by an HZNZAF
navigator Marine West on September 17,1957. The capsule was described
as about the size of a large car, and was
seen to rise out of the sea and climb out
of sight over Upolu, gliding and silent.
"And Mr. Wescott, I would
guess it was a between 1,500 and
6,000 feet in altitude."
The object changed direction at
times, and at one stage changed from a grey to a silvery
metallic colour as the sun shone on it.
It was like a small silver
capsule, Mr. Wescott added.
What detailed cosmic data it
could have gathered remains a mystery, but its very existence is undeniable. (Credit: Ronald Casell, Harlow)
