If this observation merits your attention, and I now believe it does, a more scientific description of the location of my sighting could probably be attained by a group of us going there the next day. We exchanged greetings as they passed, and they could not have regarded the green planets as we did, because they are maneuvered and departed in a remarkably colored station wagon which in Colorado."
I am not certain whether they were visitors from outer space, but I am confident of this much: the objects I saw were unlike any of the planet familiar to me, and unlike any other known pattern of flight or motion of any vehicle or aircraft of the size, speed, and color I witnessed.
Like many another citizen, I hope I was mistaken, and advanced scientific instruments corroborated my impression. And if so, at 22 probably of scientific interest for the developers to learn, I am even an average citizen can detect the extraordinary phenomena on as it moves across the sky.
Needless to say, I am not about to advertise this experience elsewhere, and at this point in my life, it is the last thing I would care having to report to the United States Government. Nevertheless, in conscience I feel it my duty to inform you of the event.

Sincerely yours,
