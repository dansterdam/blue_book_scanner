14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? LOOKING STILL IT
15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud? YES IT MOVED BEHIND SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A CLOUD
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? NO (CIRCLE ONE)
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound LIKE A BIRD, b. Color GRAYISH WHITE
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? ABOUT 1/4 TO 1/2 INCH
