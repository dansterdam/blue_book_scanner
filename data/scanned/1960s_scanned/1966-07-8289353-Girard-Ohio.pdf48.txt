The image contains a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is a hand-drawn diagram in the bottom right corner of the page, which appears to depict the shape of an object or objects. The diagram is labeled "N.E. Exhaust".

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? ENTIRELY FOR 5-10 MINUTES - MASS OF OBJECT STILL VISIBLE 
15. Did the object behind something, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) (Yes) (No) Don't Know. IF YOU ANSWERED YES, DESCRIBE:
16. Did the object move in front of something or any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) (Yes) (No) Don't Know. IF YOU ANSWERED YES, DESCRIBE: IN FRONT OF DARK, HAZY CLOUDS AT TIMES
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: NONE, HISSING, HUMMING, SWOOSH, OR ROARING
b. Color: YELLOWISH-WHITE 
c. Size: DIAMETER 1/2 TO 1 OF MOON, APPARENT SIZE
d. Shape: ROUND, OVAL
18. We wish to know more accurately the size and apparent motion of the object in terms of its angular size, angular rate, etc. How much of the object is covered by the head of a match held at arm's length? If you have performed this experiment, fill in the blanks: IT COVERS HORIZONTAL LENGTH 1/2 TO 1 INCH AT ARM'S LENGTH. VERTICAL DIMENSION 1/3 TO 1/2 INCH AT ARM'S LENGTH. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING AT ABOUT 1/4 TO 1/2 DEGREE PER SECOND
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing such things as wings, projections, etc., and especially about trails or places where an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
