Dear [redacted],

Reference your letter concerning sightings of alleged unidentified flying objects in the Azores. The information you submitted was significant for a comprehensive evaluation; however, it is being filed for information purposes. It is not the policy of this office to investigate sightings outside the continental limits of the United States.

Enclosed is a copy of the 3 February 1966 Project Blue Book and additional material for your interest and retention.
