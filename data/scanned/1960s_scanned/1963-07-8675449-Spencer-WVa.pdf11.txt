ALLIANCE, OHIO.....7/8/63.....9:30 P.M.
While playing outdoors, a 12-year-old girl reported seeing a bright, round and larger than any other star. She said that it was above the antenna of the house west of them at about 10°-45° elevation. All of a sudden the "object" disappeared straight down disappearing below the rooftops. Calling her mother, she also watched the object which was still visible. Her mother joined her in watching as the object proceeded in a horizontal path. After one minute it could no longer be seen. The girl said, "It was standing there for at least 10 sec when all of a sudden it dropped!" No sound.
Duration - one minute plus.
