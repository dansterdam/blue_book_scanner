The image does not contain any photographs, only text. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and extract all the text from the document:

The antics of subset CI are most interesting. When C.B. made contact by behind the trees, what was its singular maneuver? About that of seconds, but what about the travel of C and CI to their rendezvous point?
This and the transmission they picked up, so any clearer, than what we had before? Any light on the origin of the objects? And C and Cl the appearance, velocity of the objects? If and when such data as was obtained regarding the lights, can that be made available to the undersigned?
So I am hoping that this letter has been informative enough to you, and that additional data can be provided to confirm or deny these assumptions about the nature and strange behavior of these UFO's you have under investigation. I am quite certain that they are interplanetary in origin and feel that additional information along these lines would be of tremendous value in the general progress of this whole subject.
Sincerely yours,
