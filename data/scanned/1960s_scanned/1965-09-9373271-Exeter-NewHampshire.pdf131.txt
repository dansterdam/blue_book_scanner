STATEMENT  
UFO Sighting

I, Eugene P. Bertrand Jr., was cruising on the morning of September 3, 1965 at about 1:30 AM in the vicinity of Exeter, New Hampshire and stopped to investigate. I found a woman in the car who stated a light had been following her car and she had stopped to investigate.  She stated the light remained about 30 to 40 feet in the air and moved about what appeared to be intelligently and not erraticly [sic]. She stated it was red in color and she had been watching it for the past 10 minutes. I then took up a position to watch the light. I was about 75 to 100 feet away from it and able to see it clearly. It was about 30 to 40 feet in the air and appeared circular in shape, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. It had a white flashing light around the outer edge and a solid red light in the center. The object would move slowly at first and then pick up speed and dart back and forth across the field. When the object moved, the white flashing lights would move extremely fast around the outer edge. I observed the object for about 16 minutes and then I heard another vehicle approaching. I went back to my car and turned on the red light to flag down the approaching vehicle. As soon as I turned the red light on, the object shot straight up in the air at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The other vehicle, which turned out to be a private citizen, stopped to assist me and also observed the object before it disappeared. The witness who first reported the incident to me also again observed the object after I turned on my red light as it shot straight up and disappeared. The entire incident lasted for approximately 20 minutes. I could not make out any definite shape or outline and the object appeared to be transparent, with only the lights visible. There was no sound whatsoever. I have no explanation for what I observed. I consider myself to be a reliable witness and would be willing to testify to what I saw.
