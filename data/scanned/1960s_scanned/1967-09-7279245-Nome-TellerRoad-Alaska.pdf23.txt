The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass-like diagram with directional labels such as NW, NE, SE, and SW. The text below the diagram describes it as "the position of the phenomenon when first seen and at the interval of observation", indicating that the diagram is meant to illustrate the movement or position of some phenomenon over time.

The second set of sketches appears to show a person standing on a road or path, with a landscape or horizon visible in the background. The text below these sketches indicates that they are meant to "connect the 'a' and 'b' with a line to indicate the movement of the phenomenon between 'a' and 'b'".
