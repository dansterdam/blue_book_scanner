34. Date you completed this questionnaire: February 15, 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or your own explanation of your sighting:

The sighting occurred at corner of E and Front, date - at corner is a driveway where the object was sighted - it was a clear night and there was very little else in the sky - the object was first seen emerging from a bank of trees in the distance and approached rapidly in the sky, seemed to be moving on a fairly level plane, and, as it reached a point almost directly overhead, made a rather rapid climb and went out of sight, with complete silence - there was no correlation of any kind whatsoever with any known type of aircraft, guided missiles, Satelites, or anything else - it was sighted by two people independently at the same time and place, and proved to be the most startling and unexplained object we have ever seen.
