To investigate these sightings, as there is no play for them, the area is searched very carefully, and touched. and at times there is weatfier violence, and has been a seeming to have some fire sometimes in the air, and has been watched in Cleveland since 1949. The Rev. George E. Harber, pastor of the McKinly Methodist Church, Parma, Ohio, said that the object was seen again as last night, and there was something weil up on the second Mt. Sinai Baptist Church just as it had been before. The Rev. A. J. Turner, pastor, found he could not explain that at all, and the strange thing is that as they stand and watch the object it moves around, but some say it goes into the wind and comes back and changes shape, and this has been reported as St. Peter's--or another name that has been used for it--seen many times.
