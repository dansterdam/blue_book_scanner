The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from what appears to be a UFO report document. The page contains a questionnaire with various questions related to the sighting of a UFO-like object.

Transcription of the text in the document:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Suddenly disappeared
b. Circular shape

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Couldn't be seen.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically show the size relative to your hand or some other object. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
