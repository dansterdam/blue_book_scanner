A number of people in the Champaign-Urbana area reported sighting an unidentified flying object west of Champaign shortly after 5 o'clock, working at the University of Illinois. The object was described as coming out of the west at an estimated altitude of one-thousand feet. The object was yellow in color and had no markings, but it was pulsating and going very slowly at a level flight. It was observed for a total of 5 to 10 minutes before it disappeared.

The University of Illinois police and the FAA control tower at the U of I Willard Airport both reported that they had numerous calls about the sighted U-F-O. Several callers to Channel Three also reported the incident, and a few said they believed it to be a balloon with a flare attached.
