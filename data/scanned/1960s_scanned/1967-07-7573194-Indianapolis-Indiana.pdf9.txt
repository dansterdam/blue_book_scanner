The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The document discusses two separate UFO observations, one on July 31, 1967 and another on September 6, 1967. The text of the document is as follows:

TYPE (UFO): Maj Quintanilla/70916/mhs/21 Dec 67
UFO Observations, 31 Jul 67 and 6 Sep 67

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of two different individuals from the Indianapolis, Indiana area.
2. On the evening of 31 July 1967, one observer saw an object, described as illuminated by colliding colored lights. It was described as round and appeared to be about 150 feet in diameter. It was at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet and moved across the sky in about 10 to 15 seconds, disappearing from sight. The witness connected so that when looking at the object, it disappeared from directly under the witness. It should look similar to the end of a pair of binoculars.
3. We also received a report from the morning of 6 September 1967, in which the witness described seeing a white saucer shaped craft that was flat on the top and bottom.
4. We would like to know what may have been the cause for the sightings, if we would be able to give the observers your thinking on what may have been the cause for the sightings, we would appreciate your giving us these two cases.
5. Thank you for any assistance that you can provide in helping us to solve these two cases.
