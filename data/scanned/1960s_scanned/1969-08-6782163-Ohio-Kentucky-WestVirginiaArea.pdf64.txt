The image contains a compass-like diagram in the top portion and two sketches in the bottom portion. The diagram appears to be showing the position of a phenomenon that was observed at a certain time and the movement of this phenomenon over a period of time. The two sketches depict what seems to be landscapes or backgrounds based on the presence of hills or mountains.
