The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a collection of UFO-related reports and documents from the United States Air Force.

The text in the document reads:

Mr. is in his late thirties. He has been a professional photographer for 15 years. He has been a staff photographer for various newspapers. Since May of this year he has worked for The News, a respectable newspaper in the greater Miami area. This information about his profession has no bearing on the pertinent facts in this case because he never saw the object. It believe Mr. simply to be a little UFO controversy never hurts a photographer or the paper's credibility.

5. Please expedite your reply. Or if additional information is needed, do not hesitate. Mr. is willing to help all he can. In the interim I will make no additional statements other than the fact that the photograph is undergoing analysis at the present time. The duration of this analysis is 1959-1960. My number is 4531 (10) Homestead AFB, Address for mail or message.
