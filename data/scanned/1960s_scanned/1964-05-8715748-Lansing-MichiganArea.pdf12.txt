Lansing, Michigan
27 May 1964

May 27th, a flying saucer was seen hovering over downtown Lansing, Michigan, just before 4:00 a.m. according to five witnesses. One of the witnesses, a local businessman, called the police. Two police officers also witnessed the object hovering above treetop level. He said that the object turned on its side and appeared to be the size of a small automobile. It was soundless and left no vapor trails. Many other persons were reported to have seen the object during the early morning hours, and an Air Force investigator was eventually sent to get firsthand information about the sighting.
