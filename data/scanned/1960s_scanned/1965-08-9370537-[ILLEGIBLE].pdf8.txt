TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

"I came to the conclusion that follow the ground of business... which has convinced me that people are rather naive about the present knowledge in this field. Despite the information which is available to certain privileged persons, there are a lot of people in high positions who know nothing about it at all. Perhaps the press and the radio are too ignorant.

I maintain that all that do this for their good of all humanity, so that they will not be shown unaware in case of eventual ideas on the part of these 'mysterious visitors'. Believe me, in my entire dedication to this cause which I will up-build to the end, as the truth must be made known as possible. In France, I have also contacted Francois Geroerd G..... - French TV televised newspaper - but always nothing on this subject. His pretention whatever, I presently submit my observations of various UFOlogical visual.

During the 1939 - 1945 war, from 1942 on, I was a pilot in a destroyer to the French navy. We had many strange encounters over the sea with these unknown aerial crafts that I have seen with my own eyes, as real facts, followed some and very skilled pilots.

I do believe that the mystery of the UFOs. I have come to the conclusion as you know yourself, is far more complex and would never take such credit for it presumed by many. As you know, the question of a peace or friendly relations between humanity and the visitors does not arise since during the last 50 years and would never take such short for provide to due to an outstanding fact that we have not yet found the means of communication."
