For conversation ist Lt Edward R Goetz, MacDill AFB, Florida and Marilyn Standcomb, TSRT/UFO, 12 Mar 65.

Told Lt that received report at 0300 hours, 3 hour ago. Told him we needed more information. 

There were many footprints around the spacecraft. They were not underneath where the ship had apparently rested. The footprints seemed to come and go around the craft, approximately six or eleven. The ridges on the prints did not look like any kind of regular walking, but looked like they appeared to fit it to the bottom of a shoe. There were so many prints that he did not count them, just took in one picture.

The holes were not measured by him. A Dr C G Dennis took exact measurements and we can get this from him subsequently. The holes were approximately six inches deep and eight inches across and approximately six inches apart from each other. Asked him why they would make holes like that and he stated that he did not know, he just saw them there in one photo and there were shapes of grass in the way. Asked him why they would leave these marks and he replied that they would know the next time. The holes did not appear to be dug instruments. They looked like they were just impressions made in the ground.

Asked them why they did not identify each picture. They just didn't. They stated that they do not identify each picture. They did not identify who the people were, until this incident. An object over the shape of 1 was known to the designated person involved in this case until this time. An object and individuals were without identity or name under this case. 

Lt Goetz's personal opinion was that he didn't believe the story.
