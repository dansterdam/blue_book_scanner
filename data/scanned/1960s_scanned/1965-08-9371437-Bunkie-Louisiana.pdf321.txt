"I Couldn't Believe My Eyes"
The Witness Says - and Others Report Seeing Mysterious Sky Objects Too. 

The object was described as being about the size of a small airplane but brighter and higher in the air. Witnesses reported it moving rapidly and changing directions. Some thought it might be a weather balloon or a satellite, but others were convinced it was a "flying saucer".

CASE NO. 1.
Mrs. T. E. Schumaker, 1510 Glen Ave., Winston-Salem, reported seeing three bright lights in the sky in a triangular formation. She said the objects were not airplanes and moved rapidly before disappearing.
