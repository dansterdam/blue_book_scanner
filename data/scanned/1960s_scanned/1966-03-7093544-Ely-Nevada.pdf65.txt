REPORT ON INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

Ely, Nevada
March 7, 1966

On March 7, 1966, at approximately 7:30 PM, Mr. John Doe, a resident of Ely, Nevada, reported seeing an unidentified flying object in the sky over Ely. 

Mr. Doe stated that he was driving home from work when he observed a large, brightly lit object maneuvering in the sky. He described the object as being circular in shape, with multi-colored lights flashing around the perimeter. Mr. Doe indicated that the object appeared to be hovering for several minutes before rapidly accelerating and disappearing from view.

This incident was investigated by the Air Force's Project Blue Book, the official government program tasked with investigating reports of unidentified flying objects. The investigation included interviews with Mr. Doe and other potential witnesses, as well as an analysis of the local airspace and weather conditions at the time of the sighting.

Unfortunately, the investigation was unable to definitively identify the object observed by Mr. Doe. The case was therefore categorized as "unresolved" in the Project Blue Book files.
