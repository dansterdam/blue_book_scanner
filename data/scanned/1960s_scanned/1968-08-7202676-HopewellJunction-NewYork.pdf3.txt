The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter dated December 17, 1968 from Major James H. Aikman of the Office of Information, Civilian Air Force, responding to a previous letter about an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

SAP-OOCC/MISS TURNURE/765236/DEC. 17, 1968
DEAR MR. (REDACTED),
THIS REPLIES TO YOUR LETTER OF DECEMBER 11, 1963, IN WHICH YOU STATED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO).
UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE FOUND THAT AFTER 30 DAYS, PRECISE DETAILS TEND TO BECOME TOO VAGUE IN THE OBSERVER'S MIND TO PERMIT A USEFUL SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION.
SHOULD YOU SIGHT ANOTHER UFO, PLEASE REPORT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO THE NEAREST AIR FORCE BASE, EACH BASE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVING A UFO INVESTIGATION OFFICE WHO IS ASSIGNED TO CONDUCT A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE IF A MORE EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS IS IN ORDER.
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY YOUR SIGHTING BY LOOKING AT THE CATEGORIES OF OBJECTS OFTEN REPORTED AS UFO'S IN THE ENCLOSED PAMPHLET. IF THE OBJECT YOU SAW FITS ONE OF THESE CATEGORIES, IT WOULD NOT CONSTITUTE A UFO REQUIRING FURTHER INVESTIGATION.
SINCERELY,
JAMES H. AIKMAN
MAJOR, USAF
CHIEF, COMMUNITY RELATIONS DIVISION
