Hontzdole, Pennsylvania
Tuesday October 24, 1967.

(FTD (DET)/UFO)
Tangible relics Book
Flight - Patterson AFB, Ohio 4-5-57

Due to report and consistence we would consider this UFO report my son who is 23 years of age down to Hontzdule on 9-23-67 at 8:45 p.m. two Lights came down out of the sky and hovered over the house for approximately 5 minutes. The lights seemed to be in a diamond shape formation and about the size of a medium saucer. I needed to reopen an old UFO report on the same flight and also it was balking up and down. It started to move westerly and then it stopped and hovered again. All of a sudden it shot up into the sky at a 45 degree angle and was out of sight in a matter of seconds. 

They were going down the road on over the Hice City Dairy service station and Lab oris to see what it was doing out there just out of curiosity against it. 

My friend Herman may have an idea in broad sunlight middle of thotlly men as if could get some picture middle of thotlly may be a dozen times.
