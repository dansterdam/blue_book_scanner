FAMILY SIGHTS
Continued from page 8
Reported Feb. 6, 1966, 8:08 p.m., near York, Pa.
Mr. and Mrs. X, their children (12,10, and 7 years old), and a neighbor were outside looking into the sky when they observed a bright light moving slowly and steadily above the horizon. The object, which appeared to be about 20 feet in diameter, was estimated to be at an altitude of about 2,000 feet. After viewing the object for about 15 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared. According to the witnesses, the object did not make any noise and did not leave any trail.
