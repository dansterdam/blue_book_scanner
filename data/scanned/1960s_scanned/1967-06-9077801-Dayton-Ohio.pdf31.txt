The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yea - faded seemed to fade or vanish in the clouds

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes No (Don't Know)
If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound No 
b. Color was a general yellow resembling orange

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the head of the match?

About 8 to 10 degrees Read

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially anything that distinguishes it from a conventional aircraft. Please an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
