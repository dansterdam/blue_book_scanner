The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an object that appears to be a UFO or unidentified flying object. The sketch shows an elongated, saucer-shaped object with a central protrusion and a tail-like feature. Based on the instructions in the image, the witness has been asked to draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects they observed.

The text found in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, it moved off rapidly to the east behind some trees.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) YES / No - 

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) YES / No

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound None
b. Color Metallic - silvery light

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object (if you had performed this experiment at sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?)
About 1/2 of the object

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any of the details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails if the object was moving. Place arrows beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
