This object was observed by an aircraft pilot south of Eureka, Utah, in the Rocky Mountain area, at 3:45 a.m., on 8 April 1962. The pilot estimated that the object was about 300 yards away and that it hovered and maneuvered erratically for about 10 to 12 minutes before disappearing slowly. No conclusive identification was made. The object was described as being round, bright silvery-blue in color, and having a metallic-appearing surface.
