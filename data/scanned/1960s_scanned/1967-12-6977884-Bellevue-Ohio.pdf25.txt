The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a sketch or diagram in the center of the page, but no photograph. The text below the diagram asks the observer to draw a picture that will show the motion of the object or objects seen, and to indicate any changes in direction during the course of the observation.
