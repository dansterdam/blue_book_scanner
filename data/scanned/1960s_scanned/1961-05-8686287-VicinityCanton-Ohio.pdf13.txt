The image contains three sketches or drawings. The larger sketch on the left shows a curved line with an object above it and a horizon in the distance. The middle sketch shows a road or path leading to a distant horizon. The smaller sketch on the right shows a curved horizon line and an object or landscape feature.

In the field:

32. In the following search, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show the same curved line as it appears later.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was in when you first saw it, and a "B" to indicate where the object was in a later position when you observed it. Refer to another sketch on an example of this to complete the larger sketch.
