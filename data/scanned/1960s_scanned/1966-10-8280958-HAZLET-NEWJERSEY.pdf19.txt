Personnel interview with Neil Gallmore of Bowersville, Ohio

The alleged UFO has landed between route 73 and 128 for three straight nights and hovered over the ground for a fourth night. On the fourth night the object hovered about 1000 feet off the ground.

The object was making a beeping sound at this time. As the boys approached the object they shined a flashlight at the object. All of a sudden the object shined a light back at the boys.

The object was banana shaped and red in color. There were lights on the landing gear. Also visible were red, green, and white lights. On all four the object was visible from 2130 to 2300 hours. The sheriff and other men were keeping the crowd away from the object. Mr. Gallmore never saw the object at close range while it was making its move towards the boys.

Also at the scene of the sighting there was grass smashed down but there were no burnt marks. Mr. Gallmore said that the landing mark should be reported even though it was a week later. He called Clinton County APS on Saturday and told them they would contact the APS about the sighting.
