The sighting of an unidentified aerial object occurred about 6:15 P.M. on December 6, 1966, in Newman, Georgia. The object was observed for about 30 minutes. It was round, about 12 to 15 feet in diameter, and had a bright light on top. The object appeared to be hovering and would occasionally move in a horizontal direction without any sound. At times it would change color from a bright white light to a blue-green light. The object was observed by two witnesses, the reporting individual and a friend. Both witnesses were familiar with aircraft and this object did not resemble any type of aircraft known to them. The object eventually climbed straight up and disappeared from sight. There was no indication of propulsion and no sound was heard during the sighting. The weather was clear with good visibility at the time of the observation.
