The text in the document states the following:

Observer noted two lights with no clear outline, each object had a red and a while blinking light, object #1 moved through several positions against the night sky in the east to the west. The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. It is apparent it was also an aircraft as it was object observed through binoculars.
