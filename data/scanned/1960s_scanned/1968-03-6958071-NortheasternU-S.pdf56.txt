The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document, specifically a general comments section of a UFO report.

10) General comments - I have viewed the skies for twenty years for so-called UFO and this is the first thing I have never been able to identify or explain to my satisfaction. Taping my observations I did not note if any of the stars were observed from view as being part of the space scene. From my observations I could not deduct at the space could have been occupied or illuminated. The UFO did not behave as any known meteor or satellite. I would appreciate being informed of the outcome of the investigation of this UFO.

Yours truly,
