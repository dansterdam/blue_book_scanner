Transcript of the text in the document:

A Mariah - o - phone near the landing sight observed the object and the sound. The object, a silver colored disc, was seen hovering at about 800 feet altitude, and at one point a beam of light was observed coming from the object and striking the ground. The object then moved rapidly to the southwest and disappeared. The sound was described as a high pitched whine, different from any known aircraft. The object was observed for about 2-3 minutes.
