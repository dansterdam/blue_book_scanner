The image shows a typed letter that appears to be from Project Blue Book, the official United States Air Force program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The letter is addressed to "Brookville, Indiana 47012" and is dated September 22, 1966. It appears to be a response to a report of an unidentified flying object observed over Brookville.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

PED (TECAR) A/
HQUS-PROJECT BLUE BOOK, Ohio 45433
22 September 1966

Brookville, Indiana 47012

Dear Sir:

Reference your letter of 5 May 1966 reporting your 12 April
observation of an unidentified flying object over the Brookville, Indiana area.

I regret this delay in answering your inquiry, but due to
the present heavy workload I am just beginning to catch up
with my correspondence.

Your description is consistent with that of an aircraft.
All clues suggest this was a rotating beacon used for aircraft
identification by pilots. The light would give the appearance
of a beacon on a police car.

You mentioned the fact that the object appeared to reflect
sunlight at midnight. After leaving continued aircraft
lights, there is a high probability that pilots may have
observed an aircraft that had turned on its landing
lights. These landing lights are quite bright and would
have given the impression of sun being reflected from its
surface.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

/s/ HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
