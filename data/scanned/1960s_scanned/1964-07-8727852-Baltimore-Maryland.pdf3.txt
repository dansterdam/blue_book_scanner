Dear Miss 

This is in reply to your letter of July 30, 1964, addressed to VALI-1 in which you requested information on the passage of ECHO II over Baltimore on June 30, 1964.

You observed the passage of ECHO II which occurred over Baltimore at 3:39 P.M. on that date, moving from west to east. It is hoped that this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

HASTON M. JACKS
