There is no photograph or image present in this scanned document. The text appears to be a handwritten report or account of some sort of UFO-related incident or experience.

The text reads:

"the night powerful telescope which recently experienced sightings in the area at 11.17 on July 17th.

6 lights moving around whatever area was 800 ft. across, 200 m(?) as clocked, observed for 15 minutes. The same sights have been closer than the cause - the exhaust light came in the window as strong.

What makes me look rad d did not see the window. And the window shade was drawn back, so that whatever which appeared to have had an opportunity to be more correct. In the incident I make for. as stock under the ability of one and which I had experienced - outside.

However, I still go ahead and evaluate my recent sighting of a bright white light as continuing to remain in my mind."
