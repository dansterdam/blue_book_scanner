TRI-STATE AIRPORT

P.O. BOX 434
HUNTINGTON, WEST VIRGINIA 25709
January 4, 1968

Subject: UFO Observation, 28 November 1967

Dear Sir:

In checking the airport records, we find that Allegheny Airlines Flight 512 on November 28th and departure Allegheny Airlines Flight 510 on November 28th observed white strobe lights and a Convair 580 with red and white strobe lights and an object known as the Convair 580 maneuver. 

Several weeks ago we had the same requests from persons along the Ohio Valley, Northeast of the airport, and we found that it was in the pattern of Allegheny Airlines flights.

If we can be of any other assistance please feel free to request.

Very truly yours,

A. O. Cappadony, Manager
