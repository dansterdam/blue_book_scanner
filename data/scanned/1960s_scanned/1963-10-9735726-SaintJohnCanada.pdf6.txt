October 30, 1963

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in response to your recent letter in which you reported seeing an unusual phenomena in the Saint John, New Brunswick area on September 30, 1963.

We are inclined to believe that what you saw was the satellite 1963-36C (EXPLORER XVIII) which was making a reentry in a southeasterly direction. However, since your observation does not definitely coincide with the satellite's passage, I am requesting that you provide some additional details regarding your sighting to complete the investigation.

When we receive this information, we will be able to evaluate your report and determine the nature of the phenomena you observed. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
PUBLIC INFORMATION DIVISION
OFFICE OF INFORMATION
