U.S. Air Force:
Sirs:
I would like to tell you about an incident I saw a little over two years ago. It has to do with the so called flying saucer. Maybe my eyes deceived me, but anyhow here is what I saw. It was in May 1964 I cannot recall the date but I believe it was early in the month.
I got off a PATH train at Penn Station Newark N.J. and was walking up Commerce st. on my way to Broad St. where I was going to catch a bus on my way home.
I stopped for a light at the Highborn corner.
