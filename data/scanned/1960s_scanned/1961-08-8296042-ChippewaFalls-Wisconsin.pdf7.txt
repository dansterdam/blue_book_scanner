Transcribed text:

"it will be noted that at about 4:50 e.m. the assistant was going 
around the yard to see if anything unusual was occurring as she 
had been informed on the previous evening that something might 
take place. As she went around the corner of the garage she heard 
a very strange sound which at first she thought was a car engine 
starting, but as it rapidly increased in volume and intensity she 
realized that it was not a car. She hurried around to the other side 
of the garage to get a better view of what was causing the sound and 
as she did so she noticed a brilliant light in the sky. This light rapidly 
increased in size and brilliance until it seemed to fill the entire
sky. The sound was now so loud that it seemed to make the very air
vibrate. As the light reached its maximum intensity the sound ceased
abruptly. The light then seemed to fade rapidly and disappeared from
view. The entire episode lasted only a matter of seconds. She had the 
impression of a round or oval shaped object which gave off a brilliant
light and which made the most intense sound she had ever heard.
She was greatly startled and frightened by the incident and hurried 
back to the house to inform her husband who was still asleep. She
was so agitated and disturbed that she found it difficult to describe
the incident to him."
