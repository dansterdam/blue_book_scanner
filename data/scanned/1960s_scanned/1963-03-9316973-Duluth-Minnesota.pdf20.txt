WOOSTER, OHIO-March 31, 1963....8:00 PM
The witness, a husband and wife driving along in the northern suburb of Wooster were about to encounter what they believe may have been a UFO. 
The main light flashed downward from an estimated 1000 angle. This object was seen travelling in the same direction as the car. Suddenly, the object stopped and hovered above the car, then moved off to the side, travelling ahead of the car. At first the car which was traveling about 30 mph kept pace with the object. The object then appeared to accelerate rapidly and within a few seconds had completely pulled away from the car. The total time from the first sighting to the time it pulled away was only 2 or 3 minutes.
The object appeared to be lighted and travelling at a high rate of speed. The light was brighter than the car headlights and gradually picked up speed until it seemed to be moving at an estimated 600-800 mph. The object had no observable wings, tail, or other distinguishing features except the bright light and horizontal V to E line of flight and disappearance after 2 or 3 minutes.
