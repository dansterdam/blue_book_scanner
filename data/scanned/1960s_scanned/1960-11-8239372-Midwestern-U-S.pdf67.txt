"THE OBJECT DESCRIBED APPEARED TO BE HEADING EAST SOUTHEAST, MOVING AT A VERY SLOW SPEED, AS THOUGH IT WERE STATIONARY. ITS FLIGHT PATH WAS DESCRIBED AS ERRATIC, WITH SOME SHARP TURNS, AND ITS LIGHTS FLUCTUATED GREATLY IN BRIGHTNESS. WITNESSES ESTIMATED THE OBJECT TO BE ABOUT 20 TO 30 FEET IN DIAMETER AND ABOUT 1000 FEET IN ALTITUDE.
IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SIGHTED BY SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS, WHO DESCRIBED IT AS BEING ROUGHLY ROUND, WITH A GLOWING INTERIOR, AND SURROUNDED BY AN IRREGULAR TRAIL OF SOME SORT, DESCRIBED BY ONE AS HAVING A BELL-SHAPED SILHOUETTE. IT DRIFTED SLOWLY BETWEEN TREETOSD AND SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED.
THE WITNESS LAST SIGHTED THE OBJECT TO RESTORE APPROXIMATELY 12:05 AM. IT HAD BEEN UNDER OBSERVATION FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 TO 20 MINUTES."
