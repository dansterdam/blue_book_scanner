1. On 1 February 1967, this office received a report of an unidentified flying object sighted in the vicinity of Odessa, Delaware at approximately 1930 hours on 31 January 1967.

2. According to the witness, Mr. John Doe, he was driving home from work at approximately 1930 hours on 31 January 1967 when he observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be descending. The object was described as round in shape, approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, and emitting a bright, orange-colored light. As the object descended, it appeared to hover briefly before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight. 

3. Mr. Doe stated that he drove to a nearby farmhouse and reported the sighting to the occupants, who also observed the object. The witnesses described the object as making no sound and leaving no visible trail as it departed the area.

4. This office has conducted an initial investigation of the incident and has found no evidence to suggest a logical, conventional explanation for the sighting. Accordingly, it is classified as an unidentified flying object and is being reported as such.

5. Request any additional information or analysis your office can provide regarding this incident.
