There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten document from Project Blue Book, an official United States Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

Stele
Mr.
On June 26, 1966, at 9:30 P.M., I observed a bright light in the sky emitting a very bright orange-red beam toward the ground. The object was descending at a 45 degree angle and was approximately one quarter mile away. It was a round, flat object appearing to be about 25-30 feet in diameter, hovering approximately 150 feet above the ground. The object remained stationary for about 5 minutes, then the orange-red beam was turned off and the object moved off to the east at a high rate of speed. The object made no sound and there were no blinking lights.
I have been in the U.S. Air Force for 18 years as an air policeman, and I am quite familiar with aircraft. This object was not an airplane, helicopter, or any known aircraft. I am convinced that what I observed was a UFO.
