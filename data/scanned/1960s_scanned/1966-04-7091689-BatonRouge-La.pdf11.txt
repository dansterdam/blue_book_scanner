The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed letter discussing a UFO sighting. I will now proceed to transcribe the text from the document:

April 28, 1966

Dear Sir,

I am eighteen years old; an avid reader of UFO reports. I was sure it was a one in a million chance that I would ever see one. 

I was in my back yard Tuesday, the twenty-six, about 7:50 p.m. It was a clear evening. I looked up at the sky and there was a bright light hovering over the trees. At first I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It absolutely flashed to my right. I couldn't believe my eyes. There were no sounds, no jets, no noise at all. They flew in a V-shape pattern. It looked to me as if they were stopping to gather information. I watched them for only about ten seconds at the most before they were gone. It didn't seem possible that something that large could move that fast and disappear.

I later told my parents and they believed me. About ten minutes later I called the local radio station, but they probably thought it was a joke. There were no other reports. I know what I saw was no illusion, star, or meteorite. This sure is no joke. Could it please get some sort of information on this?

Sincerely yours,
