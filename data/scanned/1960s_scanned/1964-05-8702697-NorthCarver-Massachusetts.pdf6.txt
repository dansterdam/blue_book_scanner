There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report document.

Sighting at time of initial report. Nothing unusual was noticed.
The weather was clear, visibility unrestricted and an occasional wisp of fog was encountered.

The last report submitted by Mr. [REDACTED] of an object at 270 degrees may have been a star. The Air Almanac listed a bright star on that heading.

Radar scan of the general area was made by Boston Search and Otis RADAR. No unknown targets were observed. The area was also checked by five scanners on a EC-121 aircraft.

Comments of reporting officer are purely conjecturing, but it is felt that stars were the objects sighted.
