DESCRIPTION: 
While driving along Upper Mystic Lake in Medford, Massachusetts, the witnesses observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) hovering over the lake. The object was described as being about the size of a small automobile, glowing blue with a pulsating light. As the witnesses continued to observe, the blue light was replaced by a reddish-orange glow, and the object then moved rapidly away at a high rate of speed. The witnesses stated that they could see the object clearly and that it passed directly overhead at a low altitude. The duration of the observation was approximately 15 minutes.

This sighting appears to be a valid UFO report. The description of the object and its observed behavior is consistent with many other UFO reports. The witnesses appear to be reliable and their account is detailed and plausible. The object was observed for a significant period of time, which adds to the credibility of the report. While no physical evidence was obtained, this sighting is considered to be of significant interest and importance.
