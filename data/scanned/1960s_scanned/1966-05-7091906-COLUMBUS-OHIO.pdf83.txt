The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page consists of a blank text field labeled "35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting."

Text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 
___ Day ___ Month ___ Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
