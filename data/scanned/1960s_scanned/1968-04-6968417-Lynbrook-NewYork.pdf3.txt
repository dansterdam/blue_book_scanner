DEAR 
This will reply to your recent letter in which you report seeing an unidentified flying object (UFO). Although additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed sighting investigation your report will be sent to the people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base who will be able to determine whether the object can be sighted further.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base. Each base has a project officer who maintains liaison with the nearest investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-scene investigation which normally results in a more accurate conclusion.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that will identify the sightings. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely, 
DAVID L. STILES
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Foreign Technology Division
Office of Information
