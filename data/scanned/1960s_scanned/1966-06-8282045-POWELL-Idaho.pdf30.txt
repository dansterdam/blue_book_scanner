Dear Sir:

I have enclosed a photograph of a UFO, that I took on June 17, 1966. It was walking to the Pine Marsh, located on Pine Avenue. It appeared 59 small, which was probably 120 feet up.
I had 3 cameras with me at the time. Since I had just got F a trip from Los Angeles, I please do not use
my name if you should have an offer from a magazine company for the photograph.

Sincerely yours,

P. This photo is not a fake but is what I saw.
