Dear Mr. President:

I am very interested in UFO's. Would you send me all the reports possible?

Another boy and I are starting a search. On March 24, 1965, we heard a noise and looked out the window. We saw a great big white light, much brighter than a very full moon. It had two instruments and was hovering and then started to move information.

Sincerely,
