DE SETA BEACH. FLA.
THE OBSERVER WAS STANDING ON THE BEACH NEAR DE FUNIAK SPRINGS LOOKING NORTHWEST WHEN HE OBSERVED, THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS, TWO OBJECTS IN THE SKY WHICH APPEARED TO BE AT A GREAT DISTANCE AND AT A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE. THE OBJECTS WERE FLYING IN THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION AND APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND METALLIC IN COLOR.  
AS THE OBSERVER WATCHED, ONE OF THE OBJECTS MADE A SHARP TURN AND CAME DIRECTLY TOWARD HIM, DESCENDING RAPIDLY. WHEN THE OBJECT HAD APPROACHED TO WITHIN AN ESTIMATED TWO MILES, IT MADE A SHARP ASCENT AND REJOINED THE OTHER OBJECT.  
BOTH OBJECTS THEN ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION.  
THE OBSERVER ESTIMATED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET IN DIAMETER AND THAT THEIR SPEED WAS GREATER THAN 1000 MPH. HE ALSO STATED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE NOT REFLECTING THE SUNLIGHT AS AIRCRAFT NORMALLY WOULD AND THAT THERE WAS NEITHER NOISE NOR ANY VISIBLE EXHAUST TRAILS.
