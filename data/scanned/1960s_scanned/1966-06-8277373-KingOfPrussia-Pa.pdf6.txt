27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass rose to show the direction from which you first saw it. Place on "A" on the compass rose to show the direction from which you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" on the end of the path, and indicate any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
