The image appears to contain a handwritten document with no visible photograph. I will proceed to extract the text from the document:

On December 30, 1955 at 2:00 AM I witnessed a very bright, round, reddish-orange light in the sky which appeared to be a disc. It was motionless for a while then began to move in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed. After about a minute it accelerated and disappeared from sight.

I immediately notified the State Police in White Plains, New York who sent an officer to my home. I gave him a full report of what I had witnessed. About 2 days later I was visited by two Air Force officers who questioned me in detail about the incident. They seemed interested in obtaining any additional information I might have.

The object appeared to be about 50-75 feet in diameter and approximately 500 feet in altitude. It gave off a bright reddish-orange glow which illuminated the surrounding area. It made no sound that I could hear. After it accelerated and disappeared, the sky returned to normal.

This is the only UFO sighting I have ever experienced. I am a mature, responsible person and have no reason to fabricate or exaggerate this incident. I am simply reporting what I actually saw that night.
