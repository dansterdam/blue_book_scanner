STATEMENT OF LIEUTENANT 8489
AT: MELVILLE AS, LABRADOR, CANADA
DATE: 6 AUGUST 1963

I was on duty as Officer of the Day in the Base Operations Office on the evening of 6 August 1963. At approximately 8:15 P.M. local time, I received a telephone call from a civilian resident of Melville AS housing reporting the sighting of an unidentified flying object. The caller stated that the object had been observed for several minutes and appeared to be a bright, illuminated object in the sky.

I immediately went outside and observed the object in question for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The object appeared to be a bright, illuminated shape against the dark night sky. It remained stationary for the duration of the observation. I contacted the Duty Controller and requested that ground radar attempt to detect the object, but no radar returns were obtained.

I completed and submitted a detailed report of the incident to the Command Post.
