The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing a UFO sighting.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Could you help us decide on what your best view was. We would appreciate any information or opionion you might have. 
The size was not known exactly, long shape and bright. We are not looking for notority, only want to help in study of flying objects. We wondered how the phenomena could be analyzed. Would that be handled by the Blue Book program? Have the same incidents been recorded elsewhere. I would not know as there seems to be no green light reflecting to observers out there.

Thank you for your help handling this unusual report. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
