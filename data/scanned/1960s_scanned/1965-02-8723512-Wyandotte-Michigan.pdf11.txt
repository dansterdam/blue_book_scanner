Dear sirs,
I would like to inform you that I would like some more information about flying saucers. I would greatly appreciate it if you could give me any information you have on this subject. Also I would like to know if you can give me some idea as to what some of the information is about, and if we can't have copies of reports, can you give me some pointers so I can at least get a general idea of what is in your files. I know some of the information is classified, and you can't divulge it, but it would be very helpful to me if you can give me just a little more information so I can have some idea. You can give me whatever information you can, as I will greatly appreciate it.
Your friend,
[name redacted]
