The image appears to contain a copy slide of a photograph taken on April 7, 1966 over Price, Utah. The text describes the details of how the copy slide was made by placing the original slide in a projector and photographing it. The slide was taken with a Canny "F" stop 3, and the Vero shutter speed used was 1/25 feet. The copy slide was made with the same settings, and only 6 feet from the original slide.
