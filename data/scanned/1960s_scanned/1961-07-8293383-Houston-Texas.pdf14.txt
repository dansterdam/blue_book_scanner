Dear Mr.________ 

Your note to President Kennedy of July 12th has referred to this office.

Although the Air Force does investigate all reported sightings of unidentified flying objects, certain of our policies inhibit particular public discussions or announcements of these findings until our study is completed.

The attached fact sheet, "Air Force UFO Report," will give you an idea of Air Force findings resulting from available sightings of UFOs. I hope it will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
Major, USAF
UFO Project Officer
Office of Information Division
