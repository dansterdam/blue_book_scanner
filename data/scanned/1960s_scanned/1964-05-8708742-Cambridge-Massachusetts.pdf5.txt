The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter or document from J. Allen Hynek discussing the excellence of an observer who was trained for specific tracking of objects in the sky. The document states that the observer will be in Washington during his State Department training, and Hynek can be contacted there if any further questions arise.

weight must be given to the excellence of the observer who, in this case, was trained for specific tracking of objects in the sky.

He will be in Washington during his State Department training, and if any further questions arise, I can get in touch with him there.

Sincerely,
J. Allen Hynek
