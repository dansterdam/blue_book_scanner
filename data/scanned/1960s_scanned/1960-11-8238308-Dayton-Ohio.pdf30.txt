The image shows two sketch-like illustrations. The larger one on the left appears to be a landscape with mountains and what looks like an explosion or burst of energy in the sky. The smaller illustration on the right shows a circular diagram with some radiating lines or shapes. There does not appear to be any text or photographs present in this particular page.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the points shown. These are "A" & "B" on the curved line. This shows how high the object was above the horizon (actually, about the height of the house) when you first saw it, and a "B" where it was when you took the first photograph.

In the following sketch, sketch places on a map the location when you first saw it, and a "B" where it was when you took the first photograph. This is to verify whether approaches an example of how to explain the length sketch.
