Information Only - Not a UFO Case

16 February, 1950

At 2015 hours, ATIC Duty Officer received a telephone call from Captain Coates, USAF, Office, 1st Radar Station, Rome, New York. He advised that at 1942 hours he received information from a civilian employee of the station that an unidentified flying object was observed to the east of the station. This employee was at a filling station in Dunlap, Ohio, about 7 miles east of Rome, New York, when he observed the object.

A short time before this object was observed, a radar operator at this station had picked up an unidentified object on his scope which was moving in the background and then disappeared. When this object was observed visually, it was observed to be hovering in the sky and then suddenly the object was gone. The witness called the local police who advised him to contact ATIC.

No action has been taken by the ATIC Duty Officer other than the preparation of this report.
