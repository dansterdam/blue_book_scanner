Flying Saucer Reported
Unsuccessful Search
East Hampton, Long Island. N.Y. (AP) - An unidentified flying object, described as "an ordinary flying craft", was reported over East Hampton tonight. 
It would have been an ordinary sighting, except for the fact that a widely publicized search failed to find the object. 
The report came from two East Hampton teenagers, who described the object as: "An unidentified flying object, about the size of an automobile, almost round, hovered over the bathouses near the beach. It was a good 75 to 100 feet off the ground, and hovered over the bathouses covered by a hazy luminous glow. 
"It hovered until, as Kathy later said, it seemed to go out of sight. Only a slight disturbance in the air was left."
According to the report, the object was seen by others to the scene, and they "became quite excited" and called police. A search was made, but the object could not be found.
Mrs. Roy G. Schmitz of East Hampton, who is a member of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, said this object "fits in with many reports that have been received before."
A recent report, dated February 18, was received by the Committee from the chairman for New York. He had been called to investigate a sighting made by a police lieutenant and Mrs. Earl F. Pitch of the East Hampton police, who saw several lights "go down into the water" on March 30, when Bruce Field of Montauk reported a similar sighting. The lights were said to have been 50 to 75 feet in length, moving silently over the surface of the water. 
Although the Police did receive a call about the sighting tonight, they were unable to find the object. The search was apparently unsuccessful.
