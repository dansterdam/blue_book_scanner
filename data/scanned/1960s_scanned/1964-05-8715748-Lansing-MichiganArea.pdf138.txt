The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

Helicopters both day and night in the area; both witnesses are quite positive that the objects observed were round or near spherical in shape with solid outlines, and cannot reasonably be thought to have made the suggested motions.
Helicopters were flown in that area on the same night, but caused sensations several hours before the sighting.
An estimate of the minimum size of the subject can be obtained from the resolved power of the dark-adapted eye,and an assumption that the subject was just beyond the trees on its second pass and 800 feet high.
According to the statistics obtained(from this view rather than a realistic perspective drawing)the minimum diameter between the lights corresponds to about 2/3 of the radius of the presumed circular object.
The dark-adapted normal eye resolution is about 1 minute of arc. If the subject was 800 feet away and the minimum distance between the lights subtended an angle of 1 minute, then the diameter of the object would be about 13 feet - this by the report is not more than 3.5 feet in diameter. Clearly, it was not that small.
An attempt was made to determine the apparent size of the object as observed by both witnesses may at one point "much larger" when the size appears to have increased 1.5 to 4 times their own apparent diameter, if one is not more than 3.5 feet in diameter.
