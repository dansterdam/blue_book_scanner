The image contains a photograph showing two sketches. The larger sketch is a compass-like diagram with directions labeled around the perimeter. The smaller sketch shows a landscape with mountains and a road or path in the foreground.

Q. How IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN.
A. In the larger sketch, the letter "B" is placed in the center, indicating the position of the observer relative to the direction from which the phenomenon was last seen.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN.
IF THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND DRAW ARROWS TO SHOW THE DIRECTION OF MOTION, IF ANY, THAT THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO TAKE REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO INDICATE OBSERVED MOTION.
