POSSIBLY COINCIDENTALLY, I SAW SEVERAL LIGHTS OF NUMEROUS SMALL LIGHTED BODIES FROM MY APARTMENT AT ABOUT 12:45 AM ON 3 JUNE, 1966. FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES I OBSERVED A SERIES OF LIGHTS FLASHING AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS AND MOVING IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. I COULD SEE A SMALL GLOWING SOURCE AND A LARGER LIGHTED AREA WHICH APPEARED TO BE A BODY OF SOME SORT. THE LIGHTS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ATTACHED TO ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

LIGHTS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE AIRCRAFT, FOR EXAMPLE, NO NAVIGATIONAL LIGHTS OR OTHER IDENTIFYING MARKINGS WERE DISCERNIBLE. THE LIGHTS WERE EXTREMELY BRIGHT AND SHOWED A DEFINITE MOTION IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION.
