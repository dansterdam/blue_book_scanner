AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS (SAFOI/OC)
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20330

September 16, 1966

I am indeed very glad that my letter to his Excellency President Johnson has been duly attended to and that I have acknowledged receipt of his letter of August 1, 1966 and correspondence with Major Holt, relative to the UFO landings, witnessed by me on August 1, 1966 and acknowledged by the undersigned September 12, 1966.

In compliance with the letter, that I furnished the negatives together with the transparencies, which were submitted with the letter, I am enclosing herewith the pictures of the 203 together with their corresponding prints.

Hontarron's instructions to contact me if you do not have sufficient for release, par its publication. I have written to him to hold this in abeyance until you give further instructions as Hontarron's was very anxious to confirm his report which he made during the past week and is still available to your good office for further clarification. Please advise me of your decision in this matter at the earliest opportunity.

In case I can be of any assistance, I hope I can be of help to your good office through my discovery of these unidentifiable UFOs.

Very truly yours,

JOSE C. PAUAN
MAJOR, PHILIPPINE AIR FORCE
