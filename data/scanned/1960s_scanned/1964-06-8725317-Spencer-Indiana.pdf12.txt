Mystery photograph from France
Within a ten days interval, two inhabitants of Saint-Maur-des-Fosses, France, claimed to have seen a mysterious object in the sky. On June 27, about midnight, M. Roger went out of his house. He noticed a bright light in the sky, which he thought was perhaps an aircraft. But its motions were unlike those of a plane. It became larger, then smaller, and finally disappeared behind some trees.
Two months later, on August 29, another inhabitant of the same town, M. Lecerf, declared that it was the same object as he saw on the same date, June 27, at about midnight. M. Lecerf was starting from the cinema when he saw the object. It was then moving very slowly. He rushed into the house to get his camera, but the object was already out of sight by the time he reached the window.
It must be borne in mind that M. Lecerf was not aware of the previous sighting by M. Roger on the same date. The two accounts are therefore independent.
