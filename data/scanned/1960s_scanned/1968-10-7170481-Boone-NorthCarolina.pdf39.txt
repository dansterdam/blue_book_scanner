FLYING SAUCER ANGEL
A former highway patrolman saw a ghostly figure by the side of the road in Boone, N.C., recently, as his car's headlights picked up a strange sight. The ghostly figure was kneeling in a field by the road, and when the car's lights flashed on it, it immediately disappeared. "It was a figure of a woman glowing with a white light," the patrolman told friends. He said he had no explanation for what he saw, but it was a "very strange and unexplained experience." He was on routine patrol when the encounter occurred.
