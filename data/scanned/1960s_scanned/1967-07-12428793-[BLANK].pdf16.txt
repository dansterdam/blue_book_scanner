Dear General Garland

Our 7 July 1967 briefing to you and members of your staff on the subject of "Unidentified Flying Objects" stressed the fact that fifty million Americans now believe in the existence of the phenomenon. It was concluded that the Air Force response to this uncolored public attitude by: announcing and maintaining a scientific investigation program for UFO's, keeping the public well informed at all times, and initiating positive programs in such scientific areas as extraterrestrial communications.

The discussion initiated by the briefing was responsive and your offer to support action required to energize community interest was much appreciated.

Enclosed for your use is a written version of the briefing. To permit maximum utilization of the briefing summary, a few paragraphs were re-written to keep the entire document UNCLASSIFIED.

Recommendations which you and your staff have for redirecting the focus of the UFO problem toward greater involvement of the scientific community would be appreciated. We are pleased to serve your office and will continue to provide that support solicited of us.
