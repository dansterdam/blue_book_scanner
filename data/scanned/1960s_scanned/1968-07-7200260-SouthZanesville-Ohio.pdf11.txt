APPARENT NATURE OF OBJECT: IT SEEMED TO BE A FUZZY GRAYISH COLORED OBJECT, ROUND IN SHAPE. IT MOVED RAPIDLY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. IT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 1000 YARDS AWAY AND ABOUT 1000 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.

CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING OBSERVATION: I WAS RIDING IN A CAR WITH MY WIFE AND CHILDREN WHEN THIS OBJECT WAS OBSERVED. IT WAS ABOUT 10:30 PM ON JUNE 29, 1968. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND THE SKY WAS CLOUDLESS.

HOW LONG OBJECT OBSERVED: APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 10 SECONDS.

EXPLANATION SOUGHT: THE OBJECT MOVED SO RAPIDLY THAT IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. I COULD NOT IDENTIFY IT AS ANY KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT OR VEHICLE. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SOME TYPE OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

DID YOU NOTICE ANY DOOR, HATCH, OR REAL EMANATIONS FROM THE OBJECT OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF?
NO.

DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT THE SIGHTING BE FOLLOWED UP BY FURTHER INVESTIGATION?
YES, I WOULD RECOMMEND FURTHER INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS IF POSSIBLE.
