THE CAR WAS STOPPED (PARKED) AND ABOUT 1:40 TO 1:45 A.M. IT WAS FIRST NOTIEED COMING FROM THE SOUTHEAST, VERY LOW OVER THE TREES. IT SEEMED TO HOVER FOR A FEW MINUTES OVER THE CAR, AND THEN TOOK OFF VERY FAST TOWARDS THE NORTHWEST.

AFTER WE NOTIFIED THE UPO, IT WAS CONSTANTLY PACED THE CAR. THEN WE OBSERVED IT IN THE TREE TOPS OVER THE GRAVEL ROAD. WHEN IT FLEW OVER US IT BECAME VERY BRIGHT AND LIT UP THE WHOLE AREA. AT TIMES IT WOULD MOVE FAST, THEN SLOW DOWN. FINALLY IT WENT UP IN THE AIR AND SUSPENDED ITSELF. IT MOVED AS THOUGH IT WERE GUIDED BY SOME UNSEEN FORCE OR INTELLIGENCE. IT MOVED IN EVERY DIRECTION WITH EASE AND GRACE. I DO NOT SEE ANY FINS, WINGS OR PROPELLERS ON IT. IT JUST GLIDED SILENTLY ALONG. AFTER IT LEFT US, IT HEADED IN THE DIRECTION OF LEBANON OHIO.
