Proposed reply to letter from [REDACTED], March 30, 1967

Dear [REDACTED],

Reference your correspondence regarding your unusual observation in early January 1967, without additional information, I hesitate to make any type of explanation at this time. If you had reported the observation to the nearest Air Force installation shortly after you observed the phenomenon, a meaningful scientific investigation would have been possible.

A check of our records did not reveal any other sightings from that area in early January 1967. Your information will be filed for information purposes.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
