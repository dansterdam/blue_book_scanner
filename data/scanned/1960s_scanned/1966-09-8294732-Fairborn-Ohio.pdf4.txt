19 Oct. 66

Contact with WP Base Operations revealed that several aircraft were in the area on the morning of 17 Sept. 66. At 0813 EST DD-6 landed at the field. There was one aircraft that landed at 0908 EST which landed at 0905 EDT. A KC-135 landed at 0920 EST.

After long trips sometimes these aircraft (B-52) make several low-level runs prior to each landing. Other times they make a straight-in approach. So flying low over the area is not an unusual occurence. Although it is not positively an B-52 aircraft that makes these flights, this information is passed along for possible interest.
