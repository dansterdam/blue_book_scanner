Gentlemen:

Yesterday, the radio news mentioned that some reports of sighting a blue-green light travelling south to north. I missed hearing where a witness was. It was also reported that a bright object was seen over the area last night. It was low to the horizon and seemed to increase in size as it moved rapidly across the sky. It was observed for several minutes before it disappeared.

I would like to confirm what the official report was concerning this incident, if it is known to your office. Any information you can provide would be most appreciated. 

Yours truly,
[Name Redacted]
