The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch appears to be a compass rose with detailed compass directions, likely used to indicate the position of a phenomenon when it was first seen. The two smaller sketches at the bottom appear to show a person walking on a road through a hilly landscape.

The text output from the OCR system is as follows:

G.A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU THINK THE PHENOMENA WAS MOVING OR APPEARED TO MOVE WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "?" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU THINK THE PHENOMENA MOVED TO AFTERWARDS.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENA WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "?" AT THE POSITION TO WHICH IT APPEARED TO MOVE. INDICATE ON THE SKETCH WHETHER THE MOTION WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
