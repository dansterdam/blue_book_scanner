There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract all the text found in the document:

An information officer for eastern no determination was available by me. M/Sgt Quantanilla called SPAATS and they had no record of the space scene. Exact coordinates according to the command post. It's best estimate at the time is a 3100-3300 space object.

They obtained the atmosphere condition from Ostreal radio wanting to swap information. They told me this had reports of these objects but they did not know what they were. I told them that I have no more they had no more information to give me what I had.

I would appreciate, 800 55-2, ext 6794 I could call and I am to call them if I get any word. Quintanilla is to see them during the duty day.

Hartung Swanson, OER, advised that the
called and advised that he had received a response type material near. My name was material sensitive near the ground. We also advise that my name was been removed.
