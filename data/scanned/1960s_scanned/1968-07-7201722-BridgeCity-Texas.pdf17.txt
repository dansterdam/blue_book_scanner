HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL TO REACH THE OBJECT SIGHTED AT THE TIME. NOTE THAT THE LARGER THE OBJECT, THE CLOSER IT WOULD BE TO THE X, THE SMALLER THE OBJECT, THE FARTHER AWAY IT WOULD BE FROM THE X.
IF ANY OF ITEMS BELOW, PLACE AN X ON THE DIAGRAM TO INDICATE WHERE THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED.
IF X IS PLACED OUTSIDE THE COMPASS ROSE, INDICATE THE APPROXIMATE DISTANCE FROM THE CENTER TO X.
