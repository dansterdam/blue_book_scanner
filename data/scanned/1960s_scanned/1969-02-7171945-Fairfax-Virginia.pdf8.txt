The image contains two illustrations. The first one is a compass rose diagram, which appears to be providing instructions on how to use the compass. The second illustration is a sketch that depicts a person standing on a road or path, with a landscape of mountains or hills in the background.

GA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS DIRECTION YOU WOULD MOVE TO INDICATE THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS DIRECTION TO INDICATE THE PHENOMENON'S PATH OR MOTION.
7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO SHOW THE MOVEMENT OR DIRECTION OF ITS PATH. ALSO, SKETCH ON THIS DIAGRAM THE CONFIGURATION OR SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON SUCH AS IT APPEARED TO YOU AS AN EXAMPLE.
