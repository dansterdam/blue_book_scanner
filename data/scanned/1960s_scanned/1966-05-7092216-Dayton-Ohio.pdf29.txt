The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a page of a Project Blue Book report form with various questions and blank spaces to be filled out.

Here is the text transcribed from the form:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? At first wandered and did not return

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Quiet 
b. Color: Light yellow - a car light on at night

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? About 1/2 of the object

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A simple sketch is provided, showing a round object with two smaller round objects nearby.]
