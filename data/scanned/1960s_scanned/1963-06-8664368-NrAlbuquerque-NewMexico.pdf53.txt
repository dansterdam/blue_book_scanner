LOCAL SIGHTINGS
MIDDLETOWN, OHIO... June 9th, 11:00PM
Two young persons spotted a flashing white light the size of Sirius (brightest star). The duration (intermitted) was in close to one hour. The two boys interviewed, 19 and 20 years respectively. The object's speed of approximately 800-900 MPH was estimated by the angle of elevation first seen over the trees was approximately 20 degrees elevation. It was lost behind the trees, then reappeared again at approximately 20 degrees elevation and almost directly toward them in an impossible and almost straight line path southward. He other lights were several, they seemed to show circles and other lights below the sighting, and estimated the altitude about 4 tenths at 4,500' and 4 tenths thin cirrus. Both boys reported only one sighting of this time (2 1/2 tenths or less) and that the object certainly was much higher than 4,500' and a reddish/orange in color. Observers: David Hermandevie (third observer, out of state)
