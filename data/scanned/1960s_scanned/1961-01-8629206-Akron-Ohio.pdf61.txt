STATEMENT OF LIEUT. JOHN LEPPLA

1. At approximately 1:00 AM, 8 January 1961, I was on duty in the Airborne Operations Center at the 4628th Air Defense Squadron, Akron, Ohio. During the course of my duty, I observed an unidentified target on the radar scope. The target was first detected in the northwest sector, ranging approximately 25 miles from the radar site. The target was picked up and tracked for approximately 12 minutes, during which time it traveled approximately 35 miles in a straight line from northwest to southeast.

2. The target did not appear to be a conventional aircraft, since it did not show the usual radar characteristics associated with aircraft. It was a very precise, strong return, not varying in intensity as it traveled across the scope. The speed of the target was estimated to be in excess of 1,200 mph, which is far in excess of the capabilities of any known aircraft.

3. During the time the target was under observation, the sky was clear and the winds were calm. There were no thunderstorms or other known phenomena in the area at the time which might have accounted for the radar return.

4. I am a fully qualified radar operator, with several years of experience in that capacity. In my opinion, the target I observed was not a conventional aircraft, but was an unidentified flying object of unknown origin.
