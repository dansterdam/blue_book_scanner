Things were going slow, swimmingly. It was about 9:30 p.m., and the young couples were preparing to do what all young couples do on picnics - the fire had subsided somewhat and they were preparing to roast marshmallows.

The parties decided to slip away for a while and wandered out front, with the lights of the fire streaming out of the window. They were about 20 - 30 feet in front of the entrance, looking out at them in the dim light insist that they saw a tall figure standing close by and remained enshrouded when they asked what they had been no one out there.

About then, footsteps were heard on the roof (which is level with the terrain) and one of the crutches with him and a broken leg). They tapped on the roof, calling out, this is us now - this is our car, suspecting possible marauders. They then went to inspect the car, suspecting possible marauders.

During their observance, more steps were heard on the roof and those inside called out in no uncertain terms to cut out the horseplay.
