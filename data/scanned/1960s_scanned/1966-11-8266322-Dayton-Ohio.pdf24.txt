There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing questions and answers about a reported UFO sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes -- it faded out as it passed overhead.  

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):     Yes     No     Don't know.
If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One):     Yes     No     Don't know.
If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Shape -- round
b. Color -- a bright light-like a star

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and see how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Probably all of it.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
