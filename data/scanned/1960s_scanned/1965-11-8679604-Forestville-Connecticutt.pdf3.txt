OCR TEXT OUTPUT:
Dear Mrs. 
This is in reply to your letter to the Secretary of the Air Force regarding an observation of flares in connection with the power failure in the Forestville, Connecticut area.
The next time you make such an observation, it is suggested that you report it directly to Hanscom Field, Bedford, Massachusetts. They are able to take immediate action and investigate such reports. This local office would only be able to forward your report to them.
There is no correlation between the recent power failure and unidentified flying objects.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. SPAULDING
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Mrs.
