15. WHAT IS YOUR COMMENT IN RELATION TO THE PHENOMENON? The object was extremely bright in the sky and a bluish green color, similar to what you would see from a welding arc. It moved somewhat erratic, not in a straight path, and appeared to be circular or elliptical in shape. It disappeared behind a tree line and could not be seen as it left the area, so I cannot say for sure how it left. It appeared to be about the size of a large orange at arm's length and was estimated to have been at least a mile away. I was clearly visible to me and 3 other persons observing at the time.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR? The object moved behind a treeline and could no longer be seen. From my vantage point it appeared to have simply vanished from sight as it passed behind the trees.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE SEEMING TO OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? Just before it disappeared the object moved behind the treeline, so it was passing in front of the trees or building as it left the area.
