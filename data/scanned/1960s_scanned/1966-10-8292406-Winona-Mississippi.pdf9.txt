About the middle of March of this year, 1966, I watched the most unusually thing - an object flying in the sky.
I was at my father's home, which is about three miles outside the city. His house is on a hill, and the view of the sky is practically unlimited.
It was about 7:05 P.M. It was outside traveling the sky. I noticed it in the Far East, traveling quite fast. It had the appearance of a bug - not a big object at all. It passed over my father's house. The object was in the shape of a V or picture frame. The center of the object was a bright, red light. Neither of these lights were flashing - they were on only a few seconds. I looked at it there was no visible wiring on it. The body itself appeared transparent. I knew there was an airplane from the time I first saw this object until it disappeared in the distant sky approximately five minutes.
I trust the above and enclosed information will be of help to the Air Force and a firm believer in God Almighty and Jesus Christ. So I'm a Catholic but I also firmly believe that these objects are intelligently controlled, though they may be extraterrestrial controlled.
If I can be of any further help, please do not hesitate to call upon me.
