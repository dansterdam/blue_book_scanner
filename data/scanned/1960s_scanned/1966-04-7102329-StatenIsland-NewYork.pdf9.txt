The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document or report related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains diagrams and instructions for the observer to sketch an object or objects they observed, as well as compass directions and a diagram of a compass. There is also some handwritten text on the page.

Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.
