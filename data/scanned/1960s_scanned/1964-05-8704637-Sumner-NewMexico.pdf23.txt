Dear Sirs:

This is to send and forward a report about an object being seen quite differently from the one we especially noted here at this point. The object was at a high altitude by a commercial pilot from Los Mochis, Morelia, Mexico. They seem to be a skilled lot and I heard and saw them looking straight up and examining it quite brilliantly. 

After some inquiry, I find that April 1st, 1964, at Albuquerque, Las Cruses are checking on this while here and that there were a number watching this. I heard and saw them looking straight up and examining it quite brilliantly. 

First after sighting on April 1, 1964, while we were fishing at Lake - mean Almogordo Lake, they also have checking on this.
