The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a form with questions and space for the observer to describe their observations.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
The object was described as traveling sideways in a straight path. It maintained a constant speed until it disappeared.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes     No     Don't Know.   If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes     No     Don't Know.   If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: There was absolutely no sound.
b. Color: It had a metallic, dull dark color. 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered? Pretty good, it would probably cover one or two of them.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protusions, etc. Also indicate by arrows and labels any exhaust trails or vapor trails.
The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of the object described. It appears to be oval-shaped and was traveling in a horizontal direction rather than overhead. The sketch includes some notes indicating the object was "traveling east" and the "circled one was a puffing eastern looking than direct overhead."

And that is the text output from the OCR system.
