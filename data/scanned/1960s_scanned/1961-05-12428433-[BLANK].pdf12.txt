The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document discussing inflatable structures in space.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
of material very much like this. Doing it is to make a sort of network-like cage and inflate the rubber portion within it. But others use a different way of doing it. We at present have some studies under way under a contract of a technique or a concept which is referred to in the manual of the next item.
One item known in and reportedly this system would allow you to develop a strength, to wear this. Whether it will in fact turn out this way we don't really know. We have a model which has been built and which we are going to studies on to determine whether there is really anything in this model, whether there is something contained in air which may not be required. Then here is an interesting dynamics problem.
Which may develop in the inflatable structure, itself. This model has just another model which is under design deal with the thermal balance of the vehicle and how to hold the structure intact with the 5-foot diameter plants and things of that nature in it. There is a question of what is the temperature distribution and how do we have to paint it so it doesn't absorb radiation or do we make it black so it absorbs radiation and transmits inside an environment within the vehicle which is suitable not only for the occupants but also for the equipment.
This is a model which is under design. It is not a terribly easy model to design because of the seal laws, but we are working on this.
One further type of model, and this is a fairly large one - it is 21 feet in diameter - is being constructed for us by Goodyear. This is a mutual arrangement. I believe we are funding about half of it and Goodyear about half of it. This again is a research model. What we hope to do there is to learn something about how you package one of these things. You talk about squeezing it into a small bundle, but you don't just pick up and squeeze it. It has to be done in a fairly exact manner.
