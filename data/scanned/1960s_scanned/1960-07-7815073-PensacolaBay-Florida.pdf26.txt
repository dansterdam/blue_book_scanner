4 November 1960

Dear Mrs. -

This is to acknowledge your letter of 17 October 1960 concerning the possible UFO residuals that your organization claims to possess. We will, of course, be most interested in examining this material and any report or reports in connection with this data if made available.

The Air Force does not withhold comment on your suggestion that the separate incidents cannot be performed by an independent testing agency and I suggest that you do wish this with some responsible laboratory, or with us inter-service activities at the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center.

The Red Bluff, California sighting was probably due to the refraction of the moon through clouds which produced several light phenomena during the period of the sightings. While the actual object responsible for such sightings cannot be determined, it is highly probable that the U.F.O. seen by the highway patrol officers was the planet Mars.

The U.F.C. film mentioned could not contain any new significant evidence regarding cases of U.F.O. sightings occurring at Boulder, Colorado, 11 August 1960, or at Leets, Wyoming.

Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Lt. Colonel, USAF
