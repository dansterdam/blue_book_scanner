UFO Report

Mr. [Redacted]

1. I tried to call you several times today but was unable to make contact.

2. So that the Air Force can better evaluate your report or sighting an UFO, I would appreciate if you would provide the following information below:

a. Place, time and date of sighting.
b. Approximately how long the object was in sight.
c. Since a camera was used it will be necessary for you to make duplicates of the negatives. They would appreciate it if you would send them the film developed or not, and also the following information:
(1) Type camera used
(2) Type and make of lens
(3) Focal length of lens
(4) Shutter speed
(5) Aperture
(6) Brand and type of film

3. Any further reportings should be made directly to Base Operations at Redwood City. They are better equipped and can handle sightings much faster.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
