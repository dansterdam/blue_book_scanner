SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 23 August 1966

TO: Hq USAF (SAFOI OI)

1. Reference the attached letter concerning unidentified observations. This letter was forwarded to the Operations Office, U.S. Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi, Texas.

2. We have unable to specifically identify the aircraft which he observed on 23 August 1966. In the Texas area, there are many conventional and jet aircraft training activities, including USAF pilot training operations, Naval pilot training, and other military aircraft movements. The description given, in particular, is suggestive of aerospace functions, for they are the builders of the ECHO I satellite.

3. We feel that the observed ECHO I satellite on 23 August 1966, which was near the reported time of the sighting, could well account for this observation. ECHO I is clearly visible to the naked eye on a clear night.
