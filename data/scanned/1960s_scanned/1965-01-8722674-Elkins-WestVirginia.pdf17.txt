35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The UFO was noted by an unusual movement vehicle. Raising rapidly to the plane seats. The designed, round, bright light was traveling in the same direction, and what appeared to be the same ground speed. My attention was drawn to the fact that the object, if within unusual reflection from the aircraft or other source, was not usual with the solid outline. To the left the object passed over the mountains, the path was strait and unwavering. It gave the impression of being translucent, and not really solid at the time, instant by instant it appeared to the vast the ground at which time the object was still viewed, under the tail of the jet. The object who did not in view when the jet returned on the reverse course later he left flight appeared to the exact location might be considered to make a slight change in the part to the lift, at which time the object disappeared from view, under the tail of the jet. The object was in view of the witness under the tail of the jet for the entire period.
