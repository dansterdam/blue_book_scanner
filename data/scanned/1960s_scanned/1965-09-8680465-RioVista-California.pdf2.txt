At approx. 7:45 PM 9-8-65 my wife and I were proceeding home from Rio Vista, California to our home in Pittsburg, California. We live about 20 miles from Rio Vista. 
As we were proceeding along the highway about 1 1/2 miles outside of Rio Vista, we observed a bright light which appeared to be hovering about 50 ft off the ground and about 1/2 mile ahead of us. It was a very bright light, RB went to my house and got a 22 rifle and went out to the porch to examine the object. As we watched, the object seemed to move a short distance, about 6 yards off the ground, and then it just went straight up at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared. It was all over in less than 5 seconds. I went to the area the next morning and could find no physical evidence, no burned or marked ground. The object was simply gone. This is all the details I can give you about this incident. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
