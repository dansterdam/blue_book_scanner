There appears to be a photograph in the image, but it does not contain any human faces. The photograph shows a black, elliptical object against a white background. It seems to be a grainy, black and white image of some kind of unidentified aerial object.

DATENPORT, IOWA REPORT - 6 JUNE 1968

WITNESS STATEMENT

On 6 June 1968, at approximately 2200 hours, I observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over Davenport, Iowa. The object appeared to be roughly oval in shape and dark in color. It was moving at a slow speed and was quite low in the sky, perhaps only a few hundred feet off the ground. 

I observed the object for several minutes before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view. I was able to take one photograph of the object before it vanished. I have included that photograph with this report.

I have no other details to report regarding this sighting. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,

Civilian Witness
