This image does not contain a photograph, but rather a series of illustrations and diagrams related to the study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) as part of Project Blue Book. The illustrations include a compass rose, a sketch of the motion of an object or objects, and a diagram showing the direction of multiple objects.

The text found in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where you first saw it. Place a "C" on the same curved line to show where "A" was on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were strung out, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
