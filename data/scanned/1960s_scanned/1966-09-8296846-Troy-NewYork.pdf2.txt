The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document page from Project Blue Book, a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying object (UFO) reports.

The text in the document is as follows:

Gentlemen: 
I sat down to write this letter that you may have what I saw in more detail that you may evaluate it. 
On September 17, 1966, at about 8:30 PM I was in my room reading. Suddenly, a light appeared outside the window which attracted my attention. I immediately went out to investigate. I saw a bright, round, metallic object hovering about 100 feet off the ground and about 100 feet from me. It was silent and about 30-40 feet in diameter. It remained stationary for about 2-3 minutes before starting to move rapidly in a zigzag fashion, first up, then down, then sideways. This maneuver was repeated several times before the object shot off rapidly to the southwest and disappeared from sight. The whole observation lasted about 5 minutes. I will be glad to answer any questions you may have. There is an artist's conception of what I saw attached.
