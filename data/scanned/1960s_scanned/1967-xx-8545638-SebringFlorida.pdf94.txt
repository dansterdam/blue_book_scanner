UFO Spotted
This Morning By
Marlboro Woman
"Those brilliant flying objects (UFO) are still around - or ?"
A Marlboro woman spotted one early this morning, at 2:25 a.m., circling the skies over her house on Grove Circle, said Mrs. Bel- HUBEL.
Mrs. Huber was awakened at that time and looked out of her bedroom on hearing a strange noise, not at all similar to that of a plane.
She spotted a brilliant white object in the sky. The UFO stopped, the noise ceased and then started again, Mrs. Huber said she heard two distinct whirring sounds, not like one that would emanate from a plane, but "one with a dip" and she feels "it resembled a plane, with one big one."
The object, unlike a plane, new from a great several times, then took off and return- ed. She found "it coal and went out into her yard just to observe the UFO returning, south of the house. Again she noted a brilliant white glow, the blinking red lights and felt it was definitely not an airplane."
