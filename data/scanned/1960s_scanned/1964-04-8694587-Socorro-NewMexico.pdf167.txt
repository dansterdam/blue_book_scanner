AMS, BUDGET ($350)
NIGHT LEAD UFOS SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO
APRIL 29, 1964 - ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BOTHERS THE SCIENTIST IS THE LACK OF MENTION OF RADAR CONTACTS IN THE AIR FORCE REPORT. THIS LACK OF INDICATION OF THE RADAR EQUIPMENT IS SAID TO BE RATHER SURPRISING.

DR. TURNER OF NORTHWEST UNIVERSITY CONSULTED BY DR. HYNEK OF NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY ON THIS CASE, EXCLUDING DR. HYNER WHO VISITED THE SOCORRO POLICEMAN LONNIE ZAMORA AT VARIOUS TIMES CONCERNING THE DETAILS.

ANOTHER SIMILAR LANDING NEAR MADORA IN NORTHERN NEW MEXICO WERE SIMILAR TO THAT STATES: ZAMORA AND ANOTHER AT CLAYTON HAVE SAID THAT SEVERAL PERSONS WERE OBSERVING WHAT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN LANDED ABOUT THE SAME AREA ABOUT THAT SAME TIME, BUT THE PEOPLE HAD JUST LEFT THE AREA AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO SEE.

THE SCIENTIST WHO HAS INVESTIGATED MANY SUCH SIGHTINGS BUT USUALLY FINDS MANY CONTRADICTIONS OR OMISSIONS IN THESE REPORTS, SAID THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE CLEAREST REPORTS HE HAS SEEN.

THE LAST PART OF THE REPORT THAT BOTHERS HIM IS WHEN IT STATED THAT ZAMORA DID SEE TWO FIGURES NEAR THE OBJECT AND THEY RAN BACK INTO IT AND IT TOOK OFF. OF COURSE HE WAS TOLD THAT THESE FIGURES APPEARED TO BE SMALL AND HUMANOID BY SOME KIND OF WITNESSES.

LAPAZ RADIATION RELIABILITY UNIVERSITY WAS SUPPORTED BY DR. AND LINCOLN MATIONAL LABORATORY IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS OF COSMIC RAY PHENOMENA.

I WOULD FIRST POINT OUT THAT WE ARE NOT PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THESE INCIDENTS A SECOND TIME. WE HAVE HAD CONTACTS TODAY AND IN RECENT YEARS ONLY THROUGH WORK AND HE IS A VERY DEPENDABLE OBSERVER.

DR. HYNEK SAID HE FOUND LITTLE AT THE SOCORRO SITE. HE SAID THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE THERE NOW AND NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN TO "SEE" IF THERE'S ANY PARTICLES IN THE ASHES OR AT THE SITE THAT MIGHT BE FOREIGN TO THIS AREA.

DR. HYNEK SAID THAT HIS IMPRESSIONS FROM THE OBSERVATIONS BY ZAMORA AND OTHER AUTHORITIES HAVE IMPRESSED HIM THAT THERE IS LITTLE HERE TO CONFIRM OR DENY ANYTHING TO SEE NOW.

DR. HYNEK SAID THAT LACK OF RADAR CONTACT REPORTS BOTHERED HIM. HE SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE SUCH CONTACT AND THEN CAN TRACE THE OBJECT TO SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA.
