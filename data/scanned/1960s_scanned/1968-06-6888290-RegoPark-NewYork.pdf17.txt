JUN 251960

Dear Mr. (name redacted),

This is in reply to your letter dated January 22, 1968, in which you recommended that orders be issued to shoot down any unidentified flying objects (UFO) that would not communicate.

We must decline to follow your recommendation for a number of reasons. First, the sighting of unidentified flying objects have been determined to be natural objects such as stars, meteors, satellites, and balloons; it would be unwise to shoot down these natural aerial phenomena. Secondly, there are several categories and no useful purpose would be served by shooting at the fourth category. In addition, civilian aircraft sometimes report sightings as "UFO's". Often these planes carry no radios, and if one were shot down, it would be a serious and unfortunate incident. Furthermore, as you know, the Air Force continues to extend an open invitation to anyone who claims to have evidence or information concerning UFO's to submit his evidence for analysis; so far, no one has done so.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. ATOMIC
