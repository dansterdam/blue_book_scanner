17 APRIL SIGHTING NORTH-EASTERN OHIO
Detailed phone testimony from Chief of Police Gerald F. Bucceri, Ravenna, Ohio, regarding a sighting reported from the area. The sighting was processed and properly handled in "developing." Deputy Sheriff Dale Sears, Ravenna Division, also provided testimony, indicating he saw an object he could not identify.
Other phone calls refer to a radar report 662 radar sq. negative. 
Both Bucceri and Sears gave excellent testimony over the phone. 
I doubt much more can be gained by personal interview.
