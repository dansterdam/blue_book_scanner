The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a form with various questions about the details of a reported UFO sighting, such as the object's movement, appearance, and other observations.

Text extracted from the document:

YES
IT JUST SEEMED TO FADE AWAY SLOWLY

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
FULLER THAN MATCHSTICK HEAD

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protuberances, etc., and especially show the trail or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
