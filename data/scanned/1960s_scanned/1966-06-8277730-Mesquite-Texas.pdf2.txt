Dear Sir,

Reference your recent unidentified observations on 11 June 1966. The information in your letter was not sufficient for evaluation. 

We need additional details, such as those on the attached PID Forms 154 and return them in the envelope provided.

Also enclosed for your information is a brochure on Project Blue Book which describes the program to date.

We wish to thank you for your interest in unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

VICTOR QUITANAVILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
