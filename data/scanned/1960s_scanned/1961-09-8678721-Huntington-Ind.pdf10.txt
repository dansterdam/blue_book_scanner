DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

23 October 1961

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

Your recent letter to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been referred to the Air Force for reply.

I have enclosed a questionnaire which we would appreciate your filling out and mailing to us in the enclosed pre-addressed envelope so that we can obtain the information. 

We do not have an Echo satellite schedule at the moment. However, this information is sent to the wire services for passing to the news media throughout the nation. I would recommend that you contact your local newspaper and inquire if they run this schedule, or if they cannot do this, to give you the information so that you may lose your satellite.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
Major, USAF
UFO Project Officer

Huntington, Indiana
