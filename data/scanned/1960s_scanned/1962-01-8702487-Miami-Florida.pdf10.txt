The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to Dr. Aller J. Hynek of the Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The letter is dated January 25, 1962 and discusses an observing session that took place on that date involving four members of the Miami Astronomical Association. The letter mentions that the observers secured a "poor quality photograph" of an object they observed, which they are submitting for Dr. Hynek's review and evaluation. The letter closes by thanking Dr. Hynek for his time and attention.

Dear Sir:

On January 25, 1962, four members of the Miami Astronomical Association and I held an observing session during which we sighted a strange object in the sky for approximately 45 minutes. After securing a poor quality photograph of the object, we felt that you might be interested in examining it.

I secured a poor quality photograph of the object, and this is being submitted to the USAF Project Blue Book for their evaluation. We collected considerable additional data during the observing session, and I would be happy to provide you with a full report if you are interested.

Please advise if you wish the photograph returned. If not, it will be retained as part of our records.

I have been writing patiently for a very long, and received no acknowledgment of my photographs. Thank you for your trouble.

Yours very truly,
