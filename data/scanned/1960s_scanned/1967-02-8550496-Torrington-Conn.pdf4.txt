Dear Captain
This is to submit our report on ufo sightings in this area during the evening of February 21, 1967. At around 6:53 pm, we observed a peculiar object in the sky approximately 3 miles west of this town that appeared to be approximately 50 feet in diameter, round in shape, with a dark color and a dome-like structure on top. The object was observed for about 5 minutes by my wife and myself, as well as a neighbor, Mr. Watkins, who lives a few houses down the street. The object moved very slowly at first, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view to the north. It did not make any sound that we could detect. I am forwarding this report for your review and any further investigation you deem necessary. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Sincerely,
David Lacy
