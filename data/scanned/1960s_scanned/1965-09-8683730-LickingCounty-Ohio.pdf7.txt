STATEMENT

(UFO SIGHTING)

I observed an UFO about 20-30 degrees above the horizon, which was white in color and traveling at a high rate of speed in an easterly direction. As it made a tight turn towards the west, tracking it with my eyes, the UFO faded out and disappeared.

I observed no navigational lights, no grime, "red", and no other distinguishing features, but it gave off an appearance of two bright white lights.

The observation was passed to the tower authorities.

I swear this to be a true statement of the incident this 23rd day of September 1965.
