There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old Project Blue Book report, containing a handwritten response to a questionnaire.

The text in the document reads:

"34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 29 Aug 66

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: 

Do not believe it was a flying source. May have dropped from a plane. May have seen a man in brown with a leather hat like the aviator's and to wear stoking along the road."
