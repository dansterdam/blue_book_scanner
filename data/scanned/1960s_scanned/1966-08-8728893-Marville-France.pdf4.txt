The Big City
Glacier
The history of Glacier National Park is closely related to the Blackfeet Indians who lived under the spell of the majestic mountains. A tradition of heroism and courage with the Blackfeet is recorded in stories of the park.
The park, lying in a rugged section of the Montana Rockies, is marked not from the sacred glaciers of lofty mountain peaks, but also by the majestic grandeur of lakes - hundreds of glacial lakes that stud the valleys or are set like jewels in rocky canyons. Streams of crystal clear water flow down the mountain slopes.
Yellowstone
Three of the five entrances to Yellowstone, the largest of the national parks, are in Montana: the Gardiner entrance on the northern boundary, the Cooke City or Northeast entrance to the northeast, and the Dubois or South entrance to the southeast. The Great Yellowstone Basin, Valley and Teton Canyon, (3) to the northeast entrance, is marked by the spectacular scenery, geysers, and waterfalls that have made Yellowstone one of the world's greatest wonders. Yellowstone Lake, at an elevation over 7,700 feet, and an area of more than 150 square miles, is the largest body of water in the world located at such an elevation. Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and the famous Madison River are but two of the outstanding natural features that Yellowstone offers visitors.
