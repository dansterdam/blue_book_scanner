35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is as narrative explanation of your sighting:

This incident occurred on Sept 22, 1964. I made a general sighting of an object which I would say was approximately 20 ft in diameter, glowing a deep red and following a westerly course at approximately 1000 ft above the ground. The object remained in view for approximately 3 minutes and was witnessed by several people in the area. As I watched the object, it made a sharp turn to the north and accelerated to a very high rate of speed, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds. The object gave the impression of solid metal construction and appeared to be under intelligent control. There were no visible means of propulsion nor did it display any external lights or appendages. I was unable to determine the exact size or altitude, but it was clearly visible to the naked eye and was not an aircraft, missile, or any known aerial vehicle. The experience left a vivid and lasting impression, increasing an already strong interest in the UFO phenomenon on my part. I would be most interested in any findings or analysis of this sighting if available.
