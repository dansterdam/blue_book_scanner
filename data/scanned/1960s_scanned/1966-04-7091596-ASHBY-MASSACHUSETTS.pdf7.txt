Both auto and object were traveling westerly on route 31 from Fitchburg to Ashby, and after the object passed close by, the auto accelerated at extreme rate of speed and disappeared over or around Mt. Watatic.

I feel certain that both passengers in said auto are reliable and conscientious persons. The passenger in said auto is a school teacher in the city of Leominster, and he reportedly related his experience to the Leominster C.D. Dir., Mr. Philip Wright, who in turn contacted you.

DIRECTION - EAST TO WEST.

Yours Truly,
C.D. Dir.

P.S. WITNESS STATES THAT OBJECT DEFINITELY WAS NOT A METEORITE THAT WAS SIGHTED BY MANY PERSONS ON SAME NIGHT.
