The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, likely describing a UFO incident.

(minimum estimate) and became 100% overcast. At the point when the witnesses were together watching the display in the southern sky, the lights were about twenty degrees up, which on the 16,000 foot layer, would place them about nine miles away. Since they were still moving south, this agrees well with the thirteen mile figure from the triangulation on the baseline to Russiaville, which was determined for a later time.

The estimated sizes were determined by all the witnesses for the case in which the lights were to the south if they had been halfway between the source postulated above and the observers, they would have appeared round and about one-half degree in diameter, when on a direct line to the source, and only when off that line. A two-degree diameter would place the lights about 3/4 of the distance to the source away.

Conclusion
A reasonable interpretation of the event is that the witnesses saw lights from six searchlights known (by one of the witnesses) to have been in action at the proper time in Indianapolis. The cloud cover is sufficient to account for seeing the spots as far away as 155 miles; it is not therefore impossible for them to have been seen clearly at thirty or forty miles range, directly overhead.

The extremely fast motions seen by the observers are easy to understand when it is realized that the angle of motion seen by the witnesses would have been four to ten times as great as the actual angular deviations of the searchlights, due to the great difference between the angle of throw and the distance of observation.

The color of the lights was likened to a mercury-vapor light; this is also characteristic of the blue-white light from a carbon arc source.
