UFO SIGHTING, 29 APRIL 1966, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

PAN AMERICAN AIRPORT
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND 21240

1. This office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report concerning a sighting in the Baltimore area on 29 April 1966. Between 2100 and 2230 EDT an observer watched ten different groups of objects flying in a "V" pattern. The groups of objects numbered from 4 to 12 in each group, and were at a different altitude.

2. From the available information we feel that birds are responsible for the sightings. Information is needed from the radar section as to whether they had unmistakable targets on radar which might indicate that these were real objects in the air. We appreciate knowing about it. If there was nothing unusual on radar, that might be an indication to that effect.
