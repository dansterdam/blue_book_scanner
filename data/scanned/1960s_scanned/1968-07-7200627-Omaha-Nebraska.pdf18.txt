How many people did you tell about this?

We were shining the light on it, and it didn't seem to be affected by the light, or anything, and it suddenly just shot off to the front like a light, and then come some more lights, underneath and suddenly it was gone, we saw a little bit, but there was nothing we could see, and so we headed back.

Well, I can't tell you much else, because that's all we did, we just watched it for a while, and we could see it move around, and it would stop, and it didn't seem to be affected by the light, what direction it was going, but it was just sitting there, and then it just took off. And we well, that's the best we can tell you.
