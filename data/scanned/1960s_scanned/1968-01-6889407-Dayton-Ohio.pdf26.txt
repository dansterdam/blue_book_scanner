TPPT (UFO) Maj Quintanilla/70916/mhs/17 Feb 63
UFO Observation, 12 January 1963

Mr. George Junior Republic
Prewville, New York 13063

1. This replies to your recent correspondence on an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting of 12 January 1963. The Air Force does not investigate sightings and reports, however, if you desire to report this observation to the Air Force, she may do so by completing the inclosed AF Form 117 and returning it to the envelope provided.

2. Anyone observing what they consider to be an UFO should report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base since the local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

3. As you requested, we are returning the report of 12 January. Thank you for bringing this observation to our attention.
