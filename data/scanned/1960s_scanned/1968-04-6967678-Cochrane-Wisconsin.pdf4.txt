The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely an old report or log from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's UFO investigation program. The text in the document is as follows:

This incident occurred while I was fishing on the Chippewa River. I had noticed a strange light in the sky a few minutes earlier and as I continued to watch, the light became brighter and seemed to be coming in my direction. It suddenly halted and remained stationary for several seconds, then started moving again, zig-zagging back and forth through the sky. At times it would stop and hover motionless, then suddenly dart off in another direction. The light seemed to be oval in shape and was a glowing white-orange color. I watched it for about 10 to 15 minutes as it maneuvered around the sky in an erratic manner, making sharp turns and changes in direction and speed. Finally it disappeared over the horizon. I have no idea what it was. It definitely was not an airplane or any type of conventional aircraft that I'm familiar with. I've never seen anything like it before or since. It was a very strange and puzzling sight.
