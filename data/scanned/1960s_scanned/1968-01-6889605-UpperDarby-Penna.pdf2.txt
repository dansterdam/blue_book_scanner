On the day of December 22 we were having a small family gathering to celebrate Christmas. I had the same U. F.C. report from 1952 which my father always kept in his records. I wanted to show it to the family since it pertained to recent events in the area wherein a brilliant light was observed maneuvering over the neighborhood.

WHEN AND TO WHOM DID YOU REPORT THAT YOU HAD SIGHTED THIS PHENOMENON?
