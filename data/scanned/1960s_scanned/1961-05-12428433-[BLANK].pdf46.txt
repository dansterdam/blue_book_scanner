PROJECT MERCURY
The genesis of the Nation's manned space-flight program dates back to research and study efforts carried out in 1955-1956 and 1955.
In those years, studies were made by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, predecessor of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and by each of the military services, to determine the requirements for manned space flight.
The report of the Committee on Science and Aeronautics, House of Representatives 1963, of the President's designate in August 1958, the President assigned the responsibility for the manned flight program to NASA, which by that time had been established by the National Aeronautics and Space Act.
The initial law through which this program was established was approved on July 29, 1958.
It established the basic purpose, organization, and policies, including the development and testing of shapes, had progressed to a point on August 1, 1958, when Director of Space Flight Dr. T. Keith Glennan and now Deputy Administrator of NASA, was ready to proceed with the project.
Although the responsibility for the manned space-flight program was assigned in 1958 to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it was not until 1959 that the first seven astronauts were selected.
This program that we are talking about will lead to a man in space in something of the order of 2 to 3 years, depending on how much luck you have.
