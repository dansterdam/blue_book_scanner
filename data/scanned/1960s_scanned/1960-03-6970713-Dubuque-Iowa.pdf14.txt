Washington 25, D.C.

DEAR Major Coleman,

Thank you for your letter and the press release of August 28.

I was wondering if your office knew about a film by the name of "Unidentified Flying Object" which was shown at the Dubuque, Iowa Chamber of Commerce on August 19, 1961 more than a month ago. According to the story we received, a Dubuque businessman spotted three strange objects at dusk near Epworth, Iowa, about 20,000 feet up. He took the film which was about 320 feet long. 

In the news release that you sent me, it said that Dr. J. Allen Hynek of Northwestern University acted as Scientific Consultant to the Air Force. From the story we received, it seems he had never even seen the film. In his reply, he said that he had never seen the film. "If it will be shown to me, I will be anxious to look at it," he said.

We are asking you for any information you can give us about this film where it is, and why wasn't your scientific consultant allowed to look at it. The film, if it exists and was taken by witnesses, seems to me to make up a pretty good report.

Sincerely yours,
