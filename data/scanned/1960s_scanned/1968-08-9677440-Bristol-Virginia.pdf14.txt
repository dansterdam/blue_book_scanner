The image appears to contain two illustrations. The main illustration is a compass-like diagram with directional labels, likely used to indicate the direction of a UFO sighting. The smaller illustrations show silhouettes of a person standing on a road or path, possibly to demonstrate the perceived movement or trajectory of the observed phenomenon.

Now acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract all the text found in the document:

AS. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALL SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE SKETCH.
