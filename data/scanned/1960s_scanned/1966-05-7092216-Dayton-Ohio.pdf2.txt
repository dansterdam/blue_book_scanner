There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Here is the text output from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Disappeared behind something apparently.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: Apparently.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of: Apparently.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Whistling, seemed to come from the object.
b. Color: White, had a long tail or trail.

18. We wish to establish firmly. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Convenient to a matchstick end.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. All visible, appeared to be cylindrical, low in sky, headed in southerly direction.
