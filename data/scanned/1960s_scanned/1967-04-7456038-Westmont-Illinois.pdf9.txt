This replies to your recent correspondence concerning your unidentified observation.

Although a positive identification has not been made, investigation revealed that you probably observed a hot air balloon. The description you submitted is consistent with such an observation. Balloons of this type have been accountedfor twenty-seven sightings reported to the Air Force.

At the time of your sighting, the wind was from approximately 220 degrees. Balloons which would have covered the correct path were constructing from plastic day balloons. Not air balloons have been constructed from plastic day balloons for some time and do contain fire or such to account for the dim fiery look.

We wish to thank you for reporting your interesting observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

BARNETT E. YOUNG
