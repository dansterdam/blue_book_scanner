UFO Observation, September 25, 1967
Salt Lake City, Utah 84103

1. Reference your unidentified observation of September 25, 1967. Because of the date and the difficulty in sighting and the lapse of time since then, we feel that it is now too late to make a complete investigation into your report.

2. The description you provided is similar to others we have received of aircraft with their landing lights on. Since aircraft flights records for September 25, 1967 have been destroyed, it is impossible to determine if there were any aircraft in the area at the time your object was seen but not known, if the wind is blowing aircraft can often be seen but not heard, at the time and location from the observatory.

3. We thank you for completing our form, and your report will be filed with others of that time period. Once again, thank you for reporting your observation. In the event you should ever observe another unidentified flying object, please report it to the nearest Air Force base for a far better position.
