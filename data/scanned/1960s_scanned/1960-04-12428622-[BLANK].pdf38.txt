There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page of text from a UFO report document.

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

"These unknown objects may be, there is no indication of hostility, and since the great preponderance of the reports are readily explainable as misidentifications of common objects, it seems almost justifiable to extrapolate a bit and cover the possibility that a considerable number of the unexplained may be merely the result of poor observation, such cases would have fallen into the category of basic misidentification.

This seems a mighty dare thing to do, and might turn out to be correct, but from my own personal standpoint, as one who has had a fair amount of experience in these things, I still am not satisfied until further investigation shows that this is indeed the proper explanation. I think you will agree that many of the reports would be most difficult to explain as misidentification, yet to continue such research places one on what General Castle, General Air Defense Coordinator, Allied Air Forces, has called 'tremendously thin ice' if it appears that it may influence some serious investigation.

He has further stated that 'even the reports themselves include observations of meteorcites and balloons, and even if and dreams' - that is why vigorous and continuous evaluation of reports is essential. But after all the examination and evaluation and classification is finished, there still remain some stubborn cases which we can, therefore, categorically say that serious objects have indeed appeared and continue to appear in the sky that surround us."
