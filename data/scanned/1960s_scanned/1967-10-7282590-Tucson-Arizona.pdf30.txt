There is no photograph present on this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

b.   There are four small privately owned water towers in the immediate area of the sighting.  These water towers to some degree resemble the witnesses' description of what he saw.

C. There is a sizable amount of ant hill activity in the immediate area of the sighting (reference previously forwarded letter).  Several of these ant hills were in the dry wash, although not in the exact same location of the impression.

We would appreciate your forwarding to us, if possible, the result of your evaluation.   This topic may be brought up sometime in the future since we have a local UFO "spotter", a Dr James McDonald of the University of Arizona who also investigated this reported sighting.
