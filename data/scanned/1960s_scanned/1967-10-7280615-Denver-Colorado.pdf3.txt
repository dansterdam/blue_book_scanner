Reference your message XSCP 00202 COT 57 on an unidentified
flying object observation of 9-4102/10 Oct 57. Your paragraph 1
indicates additional information from the observers, the same object as Mr.
______ does not indicate that they observed the same object.

1. What led your office to believe that both observers were
seeing the same UFO?

2. Due to discrepancies in the information from the witnesses
and your report, request you forward the initial reports to this
office received from both witnesses. This information is necessary
prior to our office making an evaluation.
