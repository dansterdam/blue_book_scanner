NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY) 
16 FEBRUARY 1963 
WINSLOW, OHIO

LOCAL SIGHTINGS: PURSUANT TO 2/6/63 RM, 
A HUSBAND AND WIFE, WERE DRIVING SOUTH ON 
HIGHWAY 77. THEY RECALLED FROM 6:00-6:15 PM. 
THEY NOTICED A VERY LARGE, LIGHT-COLORED 
OBJECT TO THE SOUTH OF THE ROADWAY OVERHEAD. 
IT APPEARED TO BE HEADING WEST OUT OF THE AREA 
TO OBSERVE IT. WHEN FIRST SEEN, THE WITNESS
THOUGHT IT WAS AIRPLANCE, BUT SUDDENLY REALIZED
IT WAS MOVING RAPIDLY, BUT SILENTLY AND INCONSISTENT- 
LY WITH ANY AIRCRAFT. THE OBJECTS SIZE WAS LIKE 
AN 80 FOOT SAUCER. THEY ESTIMATED THE SAUCER
TO BE AT AN ALTITUDE OF 300 FEET AND ABOUT 500 
FEET AWAY. ELEVATION, APPROXIMATELY 20-25 DEGREES 
ABOVE THE HORIZON. SPEED, APPROXIMATELY 900 MPH. 
DURATION, THE WITNESSES WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 3 
MINUTES BEFORE IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT AND THEY LOST
IT FROM VIEW. THE OBJECT, AS DESCRIBED, WAS LIKE
A LARGE, BRILLIANT "LIGHT", ROUNDISH IN SHAPE 
AND SLIGHTLY CONVEX ON TOP AND BOTTOM. IT HAD A 
DEFINITE GLOW ALL AROUND THE RIM. COLOR OF THE 
GLOW WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF A FLUORSCENT LIGHT. 
JUST BEFORE DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW, THE OBJECT
STOPPED MOMENTARILY AND THEN TOOK OFF AGAIN AT AN
EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED GOING FROM SIGHT. THE WIFE
THEN PHONED THE NEWS TO HER PARENTS. AND THEY IN
TURN NOTIFIED THE LOCAL POLICE AND OTHER OFFICIALS
WHO WERE UNABLE TO VERIFY THE SIGHTINGS. IN FACT, 
IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NO ONE ELSE IN THE AREA HAD 
REPORTED SEEING THE OBJECT OR PHENOMENON. AS A 
RESULT, I THERE WAS LITTLE ELSE OF VALUE THAT COULD 
BE DETERMINED FROM THIS REPORT. IT WAS, HOWEVER,
INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THIS CASE AS DESCRIBED IS 
IN KEEPING WITH THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCI-
ATED WITH SIGHTINGS OF THIS NATURE.
