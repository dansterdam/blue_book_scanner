August 13, 1964

Dear [redacted],

This is in reply to your letter of July 31, 1964, in which you reported an unidentified flying object observed in New Iberia, Louisiana, on July 31, 1964.

The UFO you observed may possibly have been a star, planet, or some other natural phenomena. However, based upon the information provided in your letter, there is not enough data for us to make a conclusive identification.

Please note that Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's program for investigating UFO reports, was closed on December 17, 1969. We are no longer actively investigating UFO reports, but we do maintain a file on your case.

Sincerely,
EASTON M. JACX3
