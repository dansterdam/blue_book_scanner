TEXT (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/ms/22 May 63
UFO Observation, 19 April 1963

Natrona, Pennsylvania 15065

1. Reference your unidentified observation of 19 April 1963 which you reported to our office.

2. Although your sighting may have been caused by a plane with its landing lights on, our analysis indicates that you were probably observing high altitude oblong objects moving eastward and progressing toward the northeast. Thus, you should have seen Echo I in the southeast and it should have been clearly visible in the east about five to ten minutes later. Echo I has a stellar magnitude of approximately 1 and is easily identifiable as the brightest object in the east at that time.

3. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
