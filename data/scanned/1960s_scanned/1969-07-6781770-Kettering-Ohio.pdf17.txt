The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a filled-out form with various checkboxes and handwritten text. The form appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads as follows:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT MOMENT?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE SHAPE?
EMITT SMOKE, COME DOWN?
CHANGE SHARPLY?
FALL ON GROUND?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
LAND NEAR A ROAD?
HAVE COLORED LIGHTS?
APPEAR ON YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

THE FADING LIGHT.

JUST WENT INTO THE HORIZON.

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? YES" NO
