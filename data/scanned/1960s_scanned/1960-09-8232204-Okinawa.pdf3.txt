MULTIPLE SIGHTING
1. DATE: 28, 29 Sep 60
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: GMT 1015Z - 0950Z (dusk)
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1st day -- 45 sec, 2nd day -- 2-3 min
10. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS: Objects were like a star, first seen at elevation at 27-30 degrees, then moved in a straight steady course and disappeared behind a cloud bank both times.
11. COMMENTS: This case does not present much information, but does indicate that the objects viewed were probably meteors. The description supports this conclusion. The relationship between this observation and the classification is, however, out of line with this conclusion.
