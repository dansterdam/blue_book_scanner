The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter or report from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969.

Text from the document:

Gentlemen:
It would be possible to learn through U.A.C.I. what the objects sighted at the location and altitude below might have been:

Location: Grand Canyon National Park of Arizona
Time: 5:07 A.M. - 5:11 A.M., August 3, 1965
Number of objects: Two (2) 
Above horizon: 30° to 35°
Direction of travel: West to East

The objects appeared from the west, with a larger or brighter object leading, followed by a smaller and not so bright object. They disappeared into the brightness of the dawn sky.

Yours truly,
