A sighting of Unusual object in Wood County. 
It was observed from familiar with the object. It was seen by two housewives, myself and another, who saw it at the same time. This was the first time we had lived in the country and had no experience in identifying unusual aerial objects.

The object was observed by us in the sky, and there was no sound accompanying it. At no time did the object at any speed or make any maneuvers.

The satellite was then visible, and these sightings took place at about dark.

We had a very good profile of object to observe it was somewhat closer in size than a basketball, spherical in outline with a somewhat flat bottom. It had no visible means of propulsion and no exhaust trail. Its color remained constant during the entire observation which lasted for perhaps 10 minutes. The object finally disappeared over the horizon in the south direction at very slow speed.

We have also seen other unidentified aerial objects catch by surprise and at distance which would not permit detailed observations. These objects appear to be rather high speed and do not exhibit the characteristics of this particular one we observed at length.
