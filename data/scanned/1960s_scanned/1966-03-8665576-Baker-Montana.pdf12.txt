There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 0930 - Object was sighted for about 30 seconds and then appeared to disappear upwards at a very rapid rate of speed.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): YES Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: _______

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): YES Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what in front of: _______

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Rapidly moving and humming
b. Color Bright light, greenish white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Approximately 1/10 the width of my hand at arm's length covered the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please do not attempt to show the direction the object was moving.
