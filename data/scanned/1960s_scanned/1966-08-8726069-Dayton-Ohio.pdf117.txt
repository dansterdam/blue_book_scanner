The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a technical document or manual, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page provides instructions and diagrams related to observing and reporting the motion of UFO objects. The instructions include sketching the path of an object and its changes in direction, as well as estimating the number of objects if there were more than one.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
