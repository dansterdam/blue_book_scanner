This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, with handwritten text and diagrams.

Dear Sir:
My friend snapped this picture while he and I were riding in the car around 4:00 P.M. July 25, 1967. It was about 1/4 mile away. It was ascending rapidly at about a 40 degree angle. The top part of the object looked like a flattened ring, and the bottom looked like an inverted saucer. It had no apparent wings or propulsion system that I could see. For several seconds, it accelerated so fast that it was difficult for my friend to take the picture. 
Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
P.S. Here is a diagram of the path.

The image also contains a hand-drawn sketch map showing the object's path.
