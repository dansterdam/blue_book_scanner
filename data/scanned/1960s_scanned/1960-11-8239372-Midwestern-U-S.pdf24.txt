Dear Sir: 

In line with my efforts to determine the exact nature of a sighting in Dayton, Ohio on Dec. 8, 1960, I have a request. This incident was reported by a letter from Lt. Col. Tucker, for an explanation of this sighting.

The sighting (we still designate "uncertain") was a reply, he said, to a balloon launched and that later appeared to have landed. The time of the incident is reported as 6:30 p.m. The object had an apparent speed of about 200 mph, and an altitude of about 10,000 feet.

What were the circumstances of the passage of this "sighting" over Southwestern Ohio? When was it first observed, how long was it visible, what was its course, what was the weather, and what other witnesses were there?

Reports at the time referred to a single balloon launched at that location, but it is not clear whether this object in question was connected with that or not. Can you tell me more details about the object, its size, shape, color, duration of sighting, and any other pertinent information that can be obtained?

The large number of reports from a wide area around Dayton indicates your people will probably have additional data on this observation. Any information you can shed on this matter will be a valuable contribution.
