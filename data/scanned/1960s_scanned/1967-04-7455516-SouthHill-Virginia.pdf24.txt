suddenly a brilliant white column of fire-like white-hot molten steel, directly under the object, the column being about 13 inches in diameter. The downward jet could be seen splashing off the pavement. At the same instant, the object appeared to rise, and was out of sight in "just a snap of the fingers." At no time did the observer hear any sound; the car window was open next to him.

He did not actually see the object in flight; he says only that he could see "something going up." The white-hot flames did not travel upward, but disappeared in an instant after it appeared, leaving the road burning with orange flames. When the "tremendous burst of white-hot gas or flame" disappeared, it seemed to stop his car. At this point he saw the lights of another car coming toward him from the west, and turn into Norman Martin's road, to the south.

When drove past the smoldering patch on the road, which was still flickering in a few places the size of a hand; this was about 15 seconds after the initial burst of white fire. Apparently the flames on the smoldering road began to subside as soon as the flash was over. Crowder proceeded directly to the police station (state police) in South Hill.

Troopers Crawford and Murphy, and a newspaperman from town returned to the scene to search it. (The patch of burned tar was still warm to the touch when they returned.) The troopers first found three burned matches in the center of the blackened area (enclosed in brown envelope). The machine's edge of the paper book-type, and were completely consumed; they did not give the appearance of having been burned while held, but rather consumed.
