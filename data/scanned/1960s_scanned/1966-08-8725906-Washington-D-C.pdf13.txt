The image contains a compass-like diagram and instructions related to reporting UFO sightings, but there is no photograph present in this particular page.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the same curve to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place on "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place on "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" the beginning of the path, or "B" is the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
