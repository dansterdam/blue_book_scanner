Proposed reply to letter from 29 March 1967

Dear _____,

Reference your recent letter concerning an alleged observation of an unidentified flying saucer over the Farmington, Wisconsin area on 21 March 1967. A detailed investigation lead to the conclusion that the planet, Venus, was probably responsible for the sighting. 

Venus was setting in the western sky at approximately 2030 hours. Venus with a stellar magnitude, at this time of the year, of -3.4, would have been the brightest astronomical body in the western sky.

The report from Osceoola AFS reported no unusual sightings observed on radar. In addition, personnel at Osceoola reported observing a star like object quite bright in the western sky. The description submitted by the civilian observers and the military personnel are very consistent with that of an astronomical observation, with Venus being responsible for the sighting. During this time of the year Venus has been responsible for numerous alleged UFO observations.
