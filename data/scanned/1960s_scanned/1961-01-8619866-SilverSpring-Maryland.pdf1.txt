PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 13 Jan 61
2. LOCATION: Silver Spring, Maryland
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Civilian
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. PHOTOS: 0 Yes
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 min
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTINGS: Rapidly-flashing lights at horizon. (Lights were visible for about 12 minutes)
11. COMMENTS: The duration reported was just about 15 minutes. However, it would have been impossible for the witness to have clocked the object more than two or three minutes, at the most. The object was observed on radar and reported to the Control Operator. It was also visually observed. The rapid flashing of the lights is unexplained and they may have been more like two or three objects than one. This report should be categorized as insufficient data.
