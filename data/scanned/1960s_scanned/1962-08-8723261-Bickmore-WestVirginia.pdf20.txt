NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
16 AUGUST 1952
AKRON, OHIO

LEGAL SIGHTINGS:
AKRON, O., 8/16/52--11:50 AM
DET. LEARY SWARTZ:
HE SAW FROM HIS BACKYARD IN WEST AKRON A SEMI-CIRCULAR LIGHT WHICH TRAVELED SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY. IT WAS SUSPENDED IN THE SKY. IT WAS SEEN BY OTHERS IN HIS VICINITY WHO POINTED IT OUT TO HIM. IT WAS VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. IT WAS BRIGHT WHITE IN COLOR AND PULSED IN INTENSITY. IT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SEE OBJECTS ON THE GROUND CLEARLY THAT HE COULD NOT NORMALLY SEE. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE SOME 5 MILES DISTANT AND ABOUT 1,000 FEET IN THE AIR. THE OBJECT THEN SUDDENLY DESCENDED AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE, STOPPED MOMENTARILY, AND THEN SHOT STRAIGHT UP OUT OF SIGHT. HE ESTIMATED 2500 OF SKY IN IT'S COURSE. FROM THE SOUNDING OBJECTS IT WAS OVERHEAD, IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 25 FEET IN DIAMETER. AS IT QUICKLY BECAME ONE WHILE LIGHT, SEVERAL DISTINCT LIGHTS WERE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE LIGHTNING-LIKE MANEUVERING. ESTIMATED HEIGHT = 5,000'.
