After some shapes going from West to North-east. It travelled at a high rate of speed and suddenly disappeared. The object seen was the same as in Tarare Beach, Cuba, was 42 feet in diameter, about 55 feet off the sea and stopped in the air also. This object was about 200 yards away from the house and remained visible until it passed over us, no more than 80 feet above us. No sound was heard but a slow whistle or whine and nothing could be seen except a bright ball of light. The rays of light which looked like whiskers moved under to all the time, and appeared to be going crossing each other. My mother and aunt were witnesses.
