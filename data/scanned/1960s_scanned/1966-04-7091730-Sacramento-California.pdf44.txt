Reached the ground. An identical phenomenon was observed before - a group of people passing over the Sacramento area at a very high altitude. A squadron of 13 colored objects, shiny, silver or white in color, flying at a very high altitude.

One witnesses who was flying a Cessna plane and discovered this object, estimated it to be between 40,000 and 45,000 feet above the ground. The objects were flying in perfect formation and maintaining a constant heading and speed, according to the witness. The flight was estimated to last 10-12 minutes in duration. When the witness tried to pursue the objects, he could not catch up with them.

The event took place at about 10 p.m. local time (no data was specifically interrupted, because many spectators ran away afraid that it was the attack was coming). The movement was very fast and in consequence. There is a police inspector, who accepted the version of a flying saucer.
