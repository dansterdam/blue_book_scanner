PROBABLY STARS, SAYS AF

PEOPLE SEEING THINGS ALL THROUGH SKY

By United Press International

OKLAHOMA CITY (UPI) - Strange objects that float, all and speed along in the atmosphere came in from Minnesota to the Mexican border reportedly to the Air Force and possibly are nothing more than planets or stars.

The third astronomer who spoke to the Air Force said the object appeared to be "flying saucers" one of the "latest 'UFO watching' groups" but that when he checked the movements the objects were only "weather phenomena" and not UFO's.

The photographer for the Jacksonville, Tex., Sheriff's office said the light behind a dark object which appeared bright was "all the stars and planets are probably responsible for the rush of reported 'UFO' sightings." He said the Air Force said observations were all astronomical in nature.
