MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO OBSERVATION, 3 March 1963
1, March 1964
Mr. saw a UFO and said he didn't know how to describe it. 
It seemed to be "V" shaped, like three jets in formation. I didn't think it was jets because the last two were too close together, left a stream of smoke across the sky. He was sitting in a drive in theater on Rt 30 at the time of the observation. Object was going west to east. 
I didn't think much of the observation until I heard about it this morning. Saw it for about fifteen seconds, quite high, couldn't estimate altitude, and couldn't describe the object. When it started overhead I saw it.
