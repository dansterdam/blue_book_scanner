NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
25 JULY 1960 
ATLANTA, GEORGIA

Extract from Letter to the Honorable Richard B. Russell 
With specific reference to your inquiry concerning the alleged UFO which fell at Atlanta, Georgia, inquiry reveals that, on 25 July 1960, at 6:00 P.M., a practice bomb fell from the skies and landed on the grounds of the Atlanta Federal Prison Farm. No injuries or damages to property were incurred other than a hole in the ground which was 11 inches in diameter. The incident was investigated by Explosive Ordnance Disposal Detachment from Fort McPherson, Dobbins and Robbins Air Force Bases, Georgia. Fragments of the bomb were recovered which contained stock numbers and a manufacturer's name and which were identified as being part of an MA-1 Spotting Charge. The investigation further revealed that fragments from the bomb extend 25 feet to the bottom of the hole and recovered an MA-1 Practice Bomb.

Since this incident was reported through Explosive Ordnance Disposal, it appeared rather than through UFO channels. It was never considered a UFO and no UFO report, as such, was ever rendered.
