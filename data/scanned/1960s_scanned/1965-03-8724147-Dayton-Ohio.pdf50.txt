The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions related to an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The diagram appears to be a compass rose with angle markings, and the instructions ask the observer to sketch the motion and direction of the observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the compass where the object first came into view. Draw a curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
