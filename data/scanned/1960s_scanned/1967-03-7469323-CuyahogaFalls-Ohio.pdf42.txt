March 28, 1967
It was 7:55 p.m. and we had just finished eating dinner. As I looked out the window, I noticed a bright light approaching from the southwest. At first I thought it was an airplane, but as it got closer, I could see it was not an airplane, but some type of flying object. It appeared to be round or oval in shape and had a dull reddish-orange color.

The object hovered over the trees for about 5 minutes and then started to move again, this time toward the east. As it moved, it seemed to wobble or flutter slightly. The object then disappeared behind some trees. About 5 minutes later, it reappeared, now moving in a westerly direction. It moved very rapidly and seemed to be oscillating or vibrating as it went. The object then disappeared from view, moving off in the distance.

The entire sighting lasted around 8-10 minutes. At about 9:00 p.m., the object reappeared, this time higher in the sky. It remained visible for only a minute or two before disappearing again.
