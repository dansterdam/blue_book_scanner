The image contains a diagram and instructions, but no photographs. The diagram appears to show an illustration of how to track the motion of an unidentified object or objects in the sky, using angular measurements and a compass. The text instructs the viewer to place an "X" on the diagram to indicate the starting point, and track any changes in the object's direction during the course of its movement.

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "H" on the compass where you first saw the object.

There are more than one object, then how many were there? What direction were they traveling, and in what order did you observe them?
