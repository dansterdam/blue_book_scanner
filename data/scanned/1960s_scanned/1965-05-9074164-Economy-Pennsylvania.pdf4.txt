Dear Sir:

I know you are quite busy, so I will not waste your time. I am writing to you for two reasons. The request from me for a copy of the project "BLUEBOOK" and to report a U.F.O.

Enclosed you will find my report on the U.F.O., which was sighted on June 8, 1965.

First of all I would like to know who is the head of(in charge of) project BLUEBOOK - investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects. Could you please send me the name and address of the chief of this project.

On about 9:00PM on June 8, 1965 I was referred to in Frank Seully's book "BEHIND THE FLYING SAUCERS" as a witness (p.149). I was referred to in Frank Seully's book "Behind the Flying Saucers" (p.149) as a witness. The Case was supposed to have happened in 1949. According to the book, they found metal pieces and photographs with the case, which I do not recall all details - it is evidently crashed here. it was also stated that it is strongly supported. I do not fully understand - but it never mentioned what became of the vehicle and the bodies - and what conclusions were drawn by the Air Force regarding this.

I know you probably consider me a "curious at watcher" but I would appreciate it very much if you would send me the name and address of the chief of project BLUEBOOK, as I am very interested in such matters and study them.

I would appreciate if you can send me regarding this matter (not restricted by security measures). Thank you.

Yours truly,
Baden, Penna. (15005)
