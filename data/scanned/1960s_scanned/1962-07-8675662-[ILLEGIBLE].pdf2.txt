THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED AT 2330 HOURS ON 16 MARCH 1962 BY A YOUNG BOY OF ABOUT 
EIGHT YEARS OF AGE IN QUINCY, MASSACHUSETTS.
HIS REPORT ABOVE INDICATES AN OBJECT VERY MUCH LIKE A DISK, REDDISH ORANGE IN 
COLOR, HOVERING IN THE AIR WITH NO APPARENT MEANS OF PROPULSION.
IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALLISH WEATHER BALLOON AND REMAINED 
STATIONARY IN THE AIR FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO MINUTES BEFORE MOVING OFF AT GREAT 
SPEED, STRAIGHT UP INTO THE NIGHT SKY.
