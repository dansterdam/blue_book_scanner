OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PROBABLE ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA AS THE CAUSE OF SOME UNIDENTIFIED SIGHTINGS 

Figure 4 contains the wind and temperature profiles for San Nicholas Island and Vandenberg AFB for October 6, 1967. At vandenberg, AFB, the wind and temperature varied respectively from 515 ft. and 605 ft., while at San Nicholas Island, the temperature remained constant at 7:30 P.M. The lowest point on the profile, except for temperature, was reported at 7:30 P.M. and gradually rose to 20 miles. Ocean water temperatures between 50° and 60° were being reported, which is considerably warmer than the air, and this condition may have produced a mirage and vibrant observations could have been correspondingly distorted in the vicinity of Vandenberg AFB. It is more certain that the air mass conditions prevailing over the water compared to that over the land could have produced anomalous propagation effects and changes with time as reported. The detailed observations are being retained in my files. Should they be of further use to you, please let me know.

Sincerely yours,
DONALD H. STEAD, Col, USAF
