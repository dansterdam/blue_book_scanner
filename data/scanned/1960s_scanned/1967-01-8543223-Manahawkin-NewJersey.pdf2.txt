We have been trying to recall as mush detail of the object as we could. We suspect it was and I'll call it circular as best we could determine form the distance it appeared, however it was too far away to be sure that it was circular. The shape was not clear nor did we see any windows or openings. The color was not bright but rather a dull grayish-white. It was moving at a moderate speed, not extremely fast. It seemed to float through the air, as if it were not propelled as we know planes to be. We did not notice any exhaust or sound from it. So our impressions are that it was an object that we had never seen before and which did not resemble any conventional aircraft. We have not seen another H.F.O. since then.

You may be interested in knowing that a U.F.O. was reported in the night of January 17, '68 by several officers of our local police department. Also our neighbor, whose house is across the street, reported seeing the same object at the same time as we did, though apparently from a slightly different angle. We recall that something appeared to be moving in the sky, at first very slowly and then at a faster pace. We watched it for perhaps a minute before it disappeared from our view over the trees. I would be glad to cooperate further if you have any other questions.
