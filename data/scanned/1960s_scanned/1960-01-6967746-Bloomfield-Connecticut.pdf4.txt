There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a page from an old UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book, containing a form with various questions related to the sighting of an unidentified object.

Now, as requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

34.4 TEMPERATURE (Circle One)

35. When did you report to some official that you had seen the object?
Day - Month - Year

36. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object?
(Circle One) Yes No

36.1 IF you answered YES, did they see the object too?
(Circle One) Yes No

36.2 Please list their names and addresses:
[Redacted]

37. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this?
(Circle One) No Yes

37.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
I think the object was a weather balloon or some other scientific instrument. It was flying rather low and slowly, so it did not seem to be an aircraft. The weather conditions at the time were very mild, so I do not think that this would have caused any unusual atmospheric phenomena. Overall, it seemed like a fairly routine observation, though I cannot be certain of its exact nature.
