CONCLUSIONS
Project Mercury is a tremendous undertaking. It involves concurrent efforts in research, development, engineering, manufacturing, test, and flight operations. It is being carried out on a national scale, directed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and supported by the Department of Defense, industry, and research centers.
Project Mercury is one of the most comprehensive research and development programs ever undertaken in this country with respect to manned flight. A major problem is the necessity to attempt to solve many difficult obstacles which have not been satisfactorily met previously. Nevertheless, the ultimate key to the success of Mercury, the first manned-space flight program, successfully achieved on May 5, 1961.
Project Mercury is actually two research and development programs joined together by the capsule - the ballistic flight program utilizing an adapted Redstone vehicle, and the orbital flight program utilizing an adapted Atlas vehicle. The success of Project Mercury is dependent upon the ability of these two programs to solve and each contribute equally to achieving the ultimate goal of manned-space flight.
Project Mercury is progressing satisfactorily. Some slippage has occurred, but this is not unusual and is consistent with the complexity of the development programs and the development history of other large research and development programs. Project Mercury will make significant contributions to the follow-on manned-space flight programs, such as the NASA Apollo and the DOD Dyna-Soar programs.
It is considered in the present evaluation of Project Mercury that the success of this country's only current manned-space program.
