The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a schematic diagram showing a compass rose and instructions for sketching the motion and path of an observed object. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve where you first saw the object. Show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
