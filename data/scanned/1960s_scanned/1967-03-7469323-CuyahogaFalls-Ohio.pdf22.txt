the object was oval in shape and appeared quite silvery. Its movement was quite erratic, going at an extremely rapid speed then stopping and hovering for a few minutes. This object was observed about 1:00 a.m. on 1-1-67 by myself and my wife, and was over our house for about 15 minutes. Its movements were very unusal and quite unlike anything we had ever seen before. When it finally went out of sight it was still moving at a high rate of speed.
