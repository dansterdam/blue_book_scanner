The Valensole Affair
By Aime Michel

YOU have learned the essential details of the Valensole affair from the excellent text of G.C., who investigated the case on behalf of the C.E.R.O. There are two small details which he does not mention and the fact that M. Masse expressed the meeting across a vineyard, and another experience.

When M. Masse and his son were working in their field near the Valensole plateau, on the 1st of July, an unidentified flying object landed in the middle of the lavender field, about 150 meters from where they were working. Two small beings, about 1 meter in height, came out of the object and approached M. Masse. When they were at a distance of about 30 meters, M. Masse, who was very surprised and somewhat frightened, raised his rifle, which he always carried with him as a matter of precaution, and fired a shot in the air to frighten them away. The beings then returned to the object, which took off immediately and flew away.

M. Masse then went to the place where the object had landed and noticed that the lavender plants had been crushed at that spot, forming a circular area about 5 meters in diameter. The next day, he noticed that the crushed plants had begun to revive.

M. Masse was so shaken by this experience that for several days he could hardly talk about it. It was only after a week that he decided to report the incident to the mayor of Valensole. The mayor in turn informed the Gendarmerie, who came to investigate the case. 

M. Masse had another experience a few days later, which is not unique during the present wave of UFO sightings. As he was working in his field, he suddenly felt a sort of mental compulsion to look up. When he did so, he saw the same object, hovering silently at a great height. The object then shot off at tremendous speed.

In view of all this, I cannot but say that the Valensole case is one of the most impressive on record, not only because of the quality of the witness, but also because of the nature of the facts observed.
