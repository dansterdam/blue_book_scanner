The image does not contain a human face or any identifiable human features. It appears to be a black and white photograph of a hole or cavity in a tree trunk, showing the textured and irregular surface of the tree bark.

OXFORD COUNTY, MAINE
9/7/1965

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

On the afternoon of 8 September 1965, I interviewed the reporting witness, Mr. William Jones, concerning a reported unidentified flying object sighting on the evening of 6 September 1965.

SUMMARY OF INTERVIEW:

Mr. Jones stated that at approximately 7:30 pm on 6 September 1965, he was outside his home in Oxford County, Maine, when he observed a bright light in the sky to the southwest. The light appeared to be pulsating and changing colors from white to red to blue. Mr. Jones stated the object remained stationary for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view in a northwesterly direction.

Mr. Jones described the object as oval in shape, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and estimated the altitude to be around 2,000 feet. He said there was no sound associated with the object.

I have found no evidence to contradict Mr. Jones' report. His description of the object and its behavior is consistent with other UFO reports from the area. Further investigation is pending.
