FEDERAL AVIATION AGENCY
Airport Traffic Control Tower
P.O. Box 20050
Memphis, Tennessee

December 5, 1966

Colonel Louis DeCoes
Director of Technology and Subsystems
Headquarters Air Force Systems Division (AFSD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

Dear Colonel DeCoes:

This is in reply to your request of November 21, 1966, for aircraft information concerning helicopters on a flight over Memphis on November 3, 1966.

A search of all available records and information in progress at that time does not reveal any indications that could have been operating VFR and not under the control of the Memphis Tower. Inquiries made of the Memphis Naval Air Station also revealed that they had no record of any helicopter operations at that time.

Sincerely yours,
James F. Arthur
Chief, Memphis Tower
