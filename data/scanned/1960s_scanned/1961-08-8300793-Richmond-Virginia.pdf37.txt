The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The larger sketch on the left appears to show an object or unidentified flying object (UFO) above the horizon. The smaller sketches on the right depict a landscape with a person standing in the foreground, as well as a more distant landscape view.

Text transcribed from the image:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position of the object as when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
