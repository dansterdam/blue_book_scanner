1. The enclosed photograph is in response to a written unidentified
flying object (UFO) report from Rocky, Oklahoma, which occurred on
19 June 1968. (Rocky is about 10 miles north of Hobart.)

2. Although the sighting occurred sometime between 4:15 and 5:00 am 
Central Daylight Time, the description is very similar to that
of a traditional aerial advertising sign.

3. We were wondering if your plane could have been in the area and 
possibly turned the lights on for several minutes, thus causing the
UFO sighting. If your plane was not in the area, do you know of any
unusual aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.

4. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.
