SUBJECT: Unidentified Radar Returns - 19 April 1967

TO: TDET(Major Quintanilla)

1. From the information available it appears that:

a. Both search-and height finder radars were functioning properly.

b. Weather conditions were not likely to have supported extraordinary electro-magnetic refractions.

c. Visual observation was substantiated by radar.

2. The report indicates that a derelict balloon was shot down on the succeeding day; although no balloons were released in the proper time frame, this balloon should at least be considered. 

3. Weather conditions do appear to have been that which would tend to support a charged ice particle plasma. The plasma would be visible to both human eye and radar; the change color might have been a moon glow reflection as the incident occurred at 0410 hours.
