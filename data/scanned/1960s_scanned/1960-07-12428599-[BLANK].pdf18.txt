The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page of typed text from what appears to be a Project Blue Book document. I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

An increase in the services of Dr. [REDACTED] at an estimated additional cost of $1,000 per year.
An additional travel funds in the amount of $3,000 per year.
Procurement of a Polaroid camera and Geiger counter for field investigation work.
ATIC is attempting to fulfill the responsibilities assigned by AFREC-2. The proposed increase in scope of the investigation, and the required additional funds, can be justified only by the increase of resources as stated.
