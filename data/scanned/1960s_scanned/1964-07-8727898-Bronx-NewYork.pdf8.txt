MISSOURI VISIT.
22 July 1964

On: Apparently Sgt. G, who was a teacher and a radio technician, had been having sighting experiences of a high-flying UFO. One night, in April 1964, while at home in the Bronx, New York, he observed a brilliant light approach his residence. His wife also saw the object, which hovered for a brief period and then shot off at a tremendous speed. Sgt. G took several photographs, which unfortunately did not turn out.
