Dear Donald:

Enclosed you will find the "UFO" dealing with the Florida problem on 29 April 1961. Do I will appreciate your acknowledgement,

On the 29th of April I took off from Dobbins Air Force Base (Georgia) in a T-33 (jet) just after noon time, as we were flying as instrument flight rules (IFR) via high altitude (45,000). We maintain this course and altitude at the request of Jacksonville Approach Control (Florida). Near Vero Beach (Florida), Vero Beach (Florida), and then continued on to Palm Beach (Florida), to make an approach and landing at Palm Beach International Airport. 

As we approached Jacksonville all control of the jet would not respond. As we were approximately 3,000 feet, the jet was approaching Jacksonville all seemed normal, the jet would not respond to my control input, (cold) approaching the rate of descent was over 4,000 feet per minute. The jet shuddered violently as if it was encountering severe turbulence or electrical disturbance. The jet continued on its assigned course, without any control inputs from me, being piloted by a force other than myself. These UFO reports to the Hq. Air Force, MacDill Air Force Base, and other agencies are numerous. It is most unusual visual sightings, Just as we were passing over Vero Beach the jet began shuddering and the AIR speed fluctuated wildly, from 280 knots down to 180 knots. This was definitely not sufficient to produce a fluctuation of any degree. The craft did not seem to respond to any of the controls. At four o'clock position to the aircraft, I looked over the aircraft and sighted a circular shaped light, metallic in appearance, about 40-50 feet in diameter, hovering about 1,000 feet above our position. It had a reddish-orange glow around the outer edge. As we passed by, the craft moved directly across our course, thereby causing turbulence and air disturbance in the cockpit. This lasted for about 3-4 minutes. After the craft had passed, the jet controls responded normally and I was able to regain control and proceed to our destination without further incident.
