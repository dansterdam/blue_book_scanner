Transcribing the text from the document:

On 5 August 62 (approximately) the crew of a high altitude C-130 aircraft sighted a bright light at 30,000 feet which was flying erratically overhead.

(1) Ocean station November sighted the same object and reported that it seemed to be very close to the aircraft as it passed overhead.

(2) Investigation revealed that it was probably an Atlas missile fired from Vandenberg AFB. The bright light was caused by a flash fire from fuel still left in the booster on separation. The missile flight was not exactly sure of the time. Therefore it delivered the sighting and the same missile flight were in fact one and the same.

3. On 5 August at 1311Z, several aircraft at 28-33N/145W, reported a rocket firing from the surface of the ocean. The object climbed rapidly and flew towards the group of five ships within the area of the launch.

4. A query to CINCPACFLT OPS PLOT revealed that in that time and area, a Navy operation being conducted involving five ships.

5. Also on 5 August at 0500Z, a teenager reported a bright light and checked on this. Since no other sighting was made, no further action was taken.

2. This information is forwarded as background information only.
