Air Force Checking:
2 Fargo Youths Take
Photos Of 'Object'
FARGO, N.D. -  A mysterious photo of an unidentified flying object was taken Sunday night by two Fargo youths, and the Air Force is investigating. 
The youths, who were identified only as juvenile males, said they saw the object while traveling in a car on North University Drive. They stopped the car, took two pictures, and then drove off, afraid to get a closer look.
The boys, both about 17 years old, said the object was bright reddish-orange and appeared to be suspended in the air. They said it hovered for a short time, then disappeared.
The Air Force has the two photos and is checking into the incident, but a spokesman said no further information would be available until the investigation is completed.
The boys said they were afraid to get closer to the object and reported the incident to the Air Force office here Tuesday.
