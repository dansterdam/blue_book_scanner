A133XX- FIRST LEAD LITTLE JOE (270)
LT HAROLD R. WILLIAMS
WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. MAY 13 (AP)-THE FIERY EXPLOSION OF A LITTLE JOE LII ROCKET OCCURRED EARLY MORNING CALM TODAY. IT WAS THE FIRST TEST OF THE APOLLO MOON SPACECRAFT LAUNCH ESCAPE SYSTEM. EARLY INDICATIONS FROM NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WERE THAT THE TEST, OR THE APOLLO ESCAPE SYSTEM, WAS SUCCESSFUL. IT HAD BEEN DELAYED 24 HOURS BECAUSE OF WINDS A DUST STORM YESTERDAY.
A LITTLE JOE LII BLASTED INTO THE SKY ABOUT 6 A.M. (MST) FROM A CLOUD OF DUST CAUSED BY THE ROCKET'S SEVEN SOLID FUEL ENGINES, GENERATING MORE THAN 300,000 POUNDS OF THRUST. CLIMBING AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 30 SECONDS, THE 35-FOOT TALL VEHICLE STACKED WITH BOILERPLATE MODELS OF THE APOLLO COMMAND AND SERVICE MODULES, REACHED A MAXIMUM AERODYNAMIC STRESS PERIOD AT THE CLIMAXED 73 SECONDS OF GROUND SIGNAL. AT THE SAME INSTANT, EXPLOSIVE BOLTS SEPARATED THE COMMAND MODULE FROM THE DISINTEGRATING ROCKET AND THE 135,000-POUND THRUST ESCAPE ROCKET CARRIED THE COMMAND MODULE ABOUT 4,000 FEET HIGHER, SAFELY AWAY FROM THE EXPLOSION. 
THE COMMAND MODULE, WHICH WILL CARRY ASTRONAUTS TO THE MOON, SEPARATED FROM THE ESCAPE TOWER. ABOUT 3 MILES SUSPENDED BY PARACHUTES, FLOATED TO THE DESERT FLOOR ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM THE LAUNCH SITE.
A NASA SPOKESMAN SAID THE ONLY APPARENT TROUBLE WAS THAT ONE OF THE THREE 38-FOOT DIAMETER RING PARACHUTES ATTACHED TO THE COMMAND MODULE BROKE AWAY FROM THE CAPSULE SOON AFTER THEY OPENED AT 7,850 FEET ALTITUDE. EARLIER, NASA OFFICIALS HAD SAID TWO PARACHUTES COULD BRING THE CAPSULE DOWN SAFELY.
WATCHING TODAY'S TEST FROM A BLOCKHOUSE NEAR THE LAUNCH SITE WERE ASTRONAUTS LT. CHMR. CHARLES CONRAD, LT. CMDR. JAMES A. LOVELL, MAJ. GORDON COOPER, CMDR. ALAN SHEPARD JR., AND DONALD SLAYTON (NO PICKUP)
