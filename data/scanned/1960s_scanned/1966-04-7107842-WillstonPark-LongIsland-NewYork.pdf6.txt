The image contains a hand-drawn sketch depicting a UFO sighting. The sketch shows an oval-shaped object with several smaller elliptical shapes within it. The object is labeled "Front View" and there is an arrow pointing downward labeled "Looking Downward". The text accompanying the sketch provides details about the sighting, such as the date, time, and location (Williston Park, Long Island, New York).

Now, as requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:
