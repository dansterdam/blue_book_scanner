MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968
TIME: 9:45 PM 
DURATION: 1 Minute
DESCRIPTION: Thought it looked like something burning up in space. Three main objects in formation, however, I think there was something within the objects. I could only see the fire trails, yellow orange-red lights where they came across the horizon. The object disappeared over the horizon. The object seemed to be coming in from the atmosphere but it didn't lose any altitude - they were in formation, one out in front of the other. This is the only case of the other. though it looked like a burn in. I was about 20 miles from Cleveland.
FIRST SAW: 30 - 45 degrees elevation, traveled in an easterly direction.
