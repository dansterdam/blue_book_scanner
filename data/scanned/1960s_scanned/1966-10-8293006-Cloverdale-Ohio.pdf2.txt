Mrs. [redacted]/1cafoice/789a/18 Feb 66

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your aerial observation on the night of October 27, 1965, was probably caused by the planet Venus which was in the process of setting at the time of your sighting. Venus had a right ascension of 17 hours and 12 minutes and a stellar magnitude of -4.5. This placed the planet at or near the horizon at 8:30.

I am enclosing a report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force program for the investigation of unidentified flying objects. You will note that convincing physical evidence is known to exist which would indicate that UFOs are interplanetary vehicles.

The Air Force Museum is open to the public Monday through Friday from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM and Saturday and Sunday from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
