The article mentions that several unidentified flying objects were reported over San Diego during the night of December 8, 1966, and that these objects may have been parachute flares. The article also includes an "ENGINEER'S THEORY" which suggests that the objects were possibly high-altitude balloons.

Balloons, Flares Seen As UFOs
Unidentified flying objects reported over San Diego last night may have been parachute flares.
The U.S. Coast Guard reported seeing parachute flares over the Coronado Islands, 10 miles southwest of San Diego, from 8:22 p.m. until midnight last night.
The Coast Guard said the flares were dropped from an altitude of 5,000 feet and lasted about three minutes.
ENGINEER'S THEORY
A San Diego aircraft engineer believes the objects seen in the San Diego area since Friday night were high-altitude balloons.
Richard Klos, 33, an engineer at Consolidated Controls on Kearny Mesa, said it is unlikely the objects were UFOs.
Klos observed the objects through binoculars and said they appear to be balloons.
"Last night was the best sighting," he said. "I saw them through binoculars and they looked like very powerful instruments. They looked like translucent material with a honeycomb structure."
Klos, of 5479 King St., said three friends, all engineers, also observed the objects Monday night and agree with his belief they were balloons.
In the area, people have reported seeing strange objects in the sky at night. Some think they are UFOs, others say they may be residue or exhaust from the parachute flares.
