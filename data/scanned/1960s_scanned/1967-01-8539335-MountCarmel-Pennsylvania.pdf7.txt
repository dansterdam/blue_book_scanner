The text in the document reads as follows:

The witness reported seeing a saucer-shaped object with a row of lights around the edge hovering over the Mount Carmel area for about 10 minutes on the night of the incident. He stated that the object appeared to rotate slowly on its vertical axis. The witness also reported seeing a similar object on a previous occasion about a year earlier in the same general area. He described the object as being about 40 to 50 feet in diameter and appearing silvery-white in color. The witness reported that the object climbed straight up and disappeared from view after the initial sighting. No other witnesses were reported.
