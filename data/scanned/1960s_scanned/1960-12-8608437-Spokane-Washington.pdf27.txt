Andy Donnagian, dated December 14th a..95 I am the and Mrs. Harridge person
of FITZ MILL Road, Berland. About 7il5 pm (EST) on this date we were standing in our
driveway. we noticed in the northeast a glow of light that appeared to be moving. It
seemed to glew somewhat brighter, then suddenly a luminious object appeared, circular
in shape. This object seemed to be accompanied by a number of smaller objects circular
in nature. The smaller objects were observed to be flashing an intermittent light whieh
the larger object did not have. The larger object appeared to be gaining altitude and the
smaller objects seemed to remain at a similar level. These objects were observed for
approximately 5 minutes. They then seemed to gain more altitude and disappeared from
view.
