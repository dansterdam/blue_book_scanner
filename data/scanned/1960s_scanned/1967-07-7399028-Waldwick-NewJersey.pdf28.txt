CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS:
There are minor inconsistencies on the part of the witnesses' account such as apparent size, number of passes, etc. and this is to be expected. However, the basic facts are consistent and this is to be considered reliable. The witness had first observed the object at 11:03 AM and then he observed it again at 1:50 AM, but he estimated that it was approximately 1:10 AM when he first observed it. The fact that his estimate of the time was off in this manner would mean if maintained this position like a stationary star. However, this was not observed continuously. It cannot be proved that it was always in the same position, since the observation was not continuous.
The UFO characteristics described as such: 1) A cylindrical configuration, 2) No exhaust or visible propulsion system, 3) Unconventional maneuvers and speeds, and 4) No noise associated. This all points to an INTELLIGENCE SOURCE which would indicate some kind of INTELLIGENTLY MANEUVERED DEVICE, not merely an INANIMATE OBJECT, BUT a device under some form of INTELLIGENT CONTROL. The fact that the object could maneuver abruptly and change directions within 10 seconds of the stimulus overwhelming points to an INTELLIGENT CONTROL and MANEUVERING MECHANISM.
The object was not photographed, nor were any samples collected. However, other signif icant factors are mentioned in limited number of other signallings.
This report is of MAJOR importance if the contents are accurate. The facts appear to be reasonably established and the investigation to be conducted under Subcommittees will be formed and tied into the EARLY-WARNING SYSTEM.
