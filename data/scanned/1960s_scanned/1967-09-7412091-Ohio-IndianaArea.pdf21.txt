ATTN OF: TDI2/UPO

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 14 September 1967

TO: Bloomington Police Department
Bloomington, Indiana 47401

1. The Arial Phenomena Office is in receipt of unidentified flying object reports from the Indiana area which occurred on 14 September 1967 between 10:30 am and 11:20 am.

2. The reports consists of two different sightings, at approximately 10:40 am and 10:50 am, that was traveling from southwest to northeast. At 10:42 am, a single object was observed traveling from the southwest to the northeast. This object was also trailing flames, but the flames were observed for approximately two seconds.

3. These observations appear similar to that of a satellite decay and for this reason, we would like to know if your agency received any similar reports on this date.

4. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.

Sorry sir, but we don't keep permanent records on UFO reports unless there is something of an extreme extraordinary nature connected with it.
