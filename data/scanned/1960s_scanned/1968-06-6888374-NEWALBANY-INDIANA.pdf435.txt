The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a weather map or chart. The map appears to show various weather patterns, with indications of low and high pressure systems, as well as other meteorological symbols and annotations. There is no text visible in the image aside from the date "SATURDAY, JUNE 22, 1968" at the top.

To produce the text found in the document, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output the following:

SATURDAY, JUNE 22, 1968
