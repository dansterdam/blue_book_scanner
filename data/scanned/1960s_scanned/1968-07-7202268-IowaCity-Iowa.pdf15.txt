There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

None that I know of - this was an isolated incident with no relationship to the sightings of a commanded aircraft. The light or object seemed to move erratically - a small, extremely bright light, more or less stationary in the sky which seemed to fade in and out. It vanished from sight rather quickly. I could not determine any distinct shape, size, color or other details. The object appeared quite distance and gave an impression of a small light, not a physical object. There was no sound and no effect on myself or any animals or machinery in the vicinity. Its' appearance and disappearance was very abrupt.
