Force Base-White Sands Proving  
Ground Integrated Test Range suddenly blared out: "Cease firing  
range operations immediately!"  

It was Thursday, April 30, 1964.  
A Jet B-57 was flying a routine  
mission in the vicinity of Stallion  
Site, a few miles east of San An-  
tonio, New Mexico.  

The pilot had called Main Control  
and said: "I'm not alone up here."  

Control called for an explanation  
and the pilot replied: "I've got a  
UFO on the ground."  

The controller then asked: "What  
does it look like?"  

The B-57 pilot replied: "It's egg-  
shaped and white."  

"Any markings?" asked control.  
"Same as Saucers," the pilot said.  
"And there's another one, and  
another one."  

Minutes later, after the big jet  
had made its turn and come in  
over the area where the UFO was
