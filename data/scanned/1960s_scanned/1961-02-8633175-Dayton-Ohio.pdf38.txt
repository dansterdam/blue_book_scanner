The image contains three sketches, but no photograph. The first sketch shows a curved line with points labeled "A" and "B" to illustrate how high the observed object was above the horizon. The second and third sketches depict larger scenes, one showing a person standing on a road with mountains in the distance, and the other showing a road leading to a mountain range.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" where it was when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
