MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1969
DETAILS: I saw an object at 9:51 pm for 75-85 second, it seemed much longer but it probably wasn't. She made sketches of the object. Saw it through field glasses and when it was looking up it first appeared like a meteor or comet. I always take my field glasses along when I let the dog out. Saw one object and it was coming straight down at 80 deg are, was rapid speed but then as it got closer to the horizon it slowed down, then it suddenly became three. It was not a falling star because of the colors. Orange-white-red-orange. Similar to the color of the sun. They flew in a perfect military formation. The object was flat and the bottom part had a protrusion, moved very slowly in a NNE direction. I have four college degrees and I'm not sure, I teach science. I was afraid of getting the camera for fear I would lose the object and I want the objects to come and see us. There were no sparks, just a solid red-orange trail. Coming straight down and disappeared behind a house. Flashed a flashlight at the object in morse code, SOS and then again four times to the object. Also her dog is afraid of the cold and so he crawled behind the speaker can and layed down and whined. wanted to fill out a form and send her sightings to us.
