The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram with sketches and instructions. The diagram appears to be part of a questionnaire or form related to a UFO sighting, likely from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects.

Transcription of the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are of the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
