The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The text on the page describes an encounter with unidentified objects in Yosemite Park, California on August 15, 1964. The report states that three objects were observed in a parallel flight pattern, estimated to be 5-7,000 feet in altitude. The objects were described as daylight observations with no sound or sign of anything, and their altitude made it difficult to determine their size. The objects seemed small even at close range.
