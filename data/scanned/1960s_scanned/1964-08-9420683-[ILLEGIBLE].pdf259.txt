Thinking Of Survival
EDITOR: Standard Times, 'RICHARD GORDON, Editor of The Detroit Free Press, says the 'White people in America and Asia and don't know it. But thanks to our many programs on survival, I am sure they are doing something about it.'
The article states that "Thanks to our many programs on survival, I am sure they are doing something about it" in response to the increasing threat that is growing through mass survival groups. It discusses how during the past several years, people have become interested in survival skills and techniques, such as building wooden ships and planning for wars. The writer suggests that the white people in Africa are trying to exterminate the natives and get out, just as the native Americans were exterminated in the past. The article concludes by stating that "it is high time the people of the world to do like everything else and think first, foremost and only of self-preserve, the chance and survival."
