There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

Length of the second sighting of the object was estimated by the witness to be ten seconds. It must have bolted immediately after seeing the object for a second time, and when the witness noticed this, he had gone, he also made for the car. The two men then returned to Yonkers to fetch more people to the scene.

When the next group of people returned to the area, the object was nowhere to be seen. It was discovered at this time, however, that a pond of water, approximately 100 feet in diameter and located within the gravel pit, was covered with ice.

The discovery was reported to deputy sheriff Don Holko at 2:00 a.m. He investigated the report immediately.

The presence and characteristics of the ice were difficult to explain: temperatures in the area were well above freezing and had been thus for several days previous to the sighting. Puddles bordering the frozen pond showed absolutely no signs of ice.

Holko reported that the pond was frozen solid and thickened as much as one foot from the edge of the pond was firm in places. Another unusual feature of the ice was that it was 12 inches in thickness, considering the fact that it was raining very heavily at the time. The pond was checked for radiation and no abnormal levels were discovered.

Other details uncovered during the subsequent investigation of the incident were that the ice on the pond measured as much as three inches thick in spots and that it was formed in layers ranging from two to five inches in quantity. The ice was also riddled with large numbers of air bubbles containing air dirt.
