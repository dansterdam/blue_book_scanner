1. This aircraft resembled an A-4C aircraft. I should also note that this is a firsthand sighting of the UFO.
2. Additional details about the incident describe the object as flat, disc-like, and about 40 feet in diameter. It was observed for several minutes before departing at a very high rate of speed.
