The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report document, describing a UFO sighting incident that occurred in Socorro, New Mexico on April 24, 1964.

Text from the document:

A 20-year-old patrolman, Officer Lonnie Zamora, was fired six shots at a low-flying object on April 24, 1964 near Socorro, New Mexico. State Policeman Tommy Richardson of Moriarty received a telephone call from Don Adams of Edgewood about 1:45 p.m. today.

Adams said he saw the object which appeared to be a fluorescent or glowing, green-colored object about 25 feet long. It had the officer he drove his car under the object and his car stalled. The youth reported he then got out and saw six shots being fired at the object by a uniformed officer, presumably Zamora.

There were two other sightings in the same area near Espanola. All the sightings were similar in that they describe oval or egg-shaped objects with a metallic surface which left a scorched earth at the site, and rose from the ground and took off at a high rate of speed, leaving no evidence of landing gear.

Military bases say they have no such aircraft fitting the descriptions included.

Reports from Monday night included:
1) A man who refused to identify himself because he said he would be laughed at, said he saw a ball of red flame land near Las Vegas. He made no estimate of the size of the ball.
2) He said he was going from Lake McAllister to Las Vegas when he saw the object.
