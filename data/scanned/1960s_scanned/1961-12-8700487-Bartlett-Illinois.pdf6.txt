A circular halo of pure white light shown in the sky and was at first taken for a large stariy object. It seemed to remain stationary for a while and was difficult to determine whether it slowly drifted or slowly became dimmer. As the girl watched the object after her attention was first attracted to it, she observed that it seemed to decrease slowly in size. she could also see something in the center of this halo, that appeared to be a type of lens or mirror effect. The shape of this central portion was ill-defined and constantly changing. The entire phenomenon lasted for several minutes. The family did not see any means of propulsion or confirm the nature of the source of the light. Rather than speculate or theorize about the nature of this sighting, they reported it to the proper authorities as an unexplained aerial phenomenon.
