Time: 6:55 P.M.
Subject: Weather balloon seen over Rivesville, West Virginia
Location: Rivesville, West Virginia 
Witness: Frank Hudson, Elkins, Arkansas, reports the following observation of a UFO:
On February 26, 1965, at 7:10 P.M. CST, he and his wife were outside their home when they noticed a light in the eastern horizon. The light was about the size of a star and was rapidly getting brighter. It appeared to be heading SE about jet speed. It was thought at first that it might be a shooting star, but it did not fall and completely burn out. I tracked it with my 60X scope, and saw it was not a star, but a definite light, moving steadily SE.
The light was amber in color and was very bright, dimming and brightening for the first part of the sighting. It faded above the horizon after about 30-45 seconds. Weather clear. Light north breeze. Seen through 60X scope it showed one white light.
