The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed letter responding to an observation report regarding an unusual observation on the night of 19 September 1966.

Proposed reply to letter from  21 September 1966

Dear Mr. 

Reference your letter of 21 September 1966 regarding your unusual observation on the night of 19 September 1966. Without additional information a comprehensive study is not possible.

From the submitted information it does appear that the moon could have been responsible for the observation. This would depend on whether you observed this object at 9:30 P.M. CDT or GMT. Since the moon would have been setting at approximately 9:00 GMT on a azimuth of 250 degrees, the one hour would have made a lot of difference. On the 19th, the moon would have been approaching the first quarter which occurred on 21 September 1966.

If you would complete the enclosed Air Force form 14, a more scientific investigation will be possible.
