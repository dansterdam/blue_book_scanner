The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document describing an observation of a UFO. The document appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report from 1960 regarding an incident that occurred on August 11, 1960 in Left Hand Canyon, Colorado.

AUG. 11, 1960 LEFT HAND CANYON, COLORADO (LORENZEN P 244) T WITNESS '00
RAY HANSEN, OF BOULDER, WAS WORKING A FARM TRACTOR IN SECLUDED LEFT HAND
CANYON, WEST OF BOULDER. HEARING A MUFFLED EXPLOSION WHICH SEEMED TO COME
FROM ABOVE, HE LOOKED UP AND SIGHTED A ROUND OBJECT DROPPED VERTICALLY THROUGH
A CLOUD, STOPPING ABOUT 650 FEET AWAY AND SOME 200 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. THE 04
OBJECT SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE AS IT SLOWLY BUT A COIN VOLUME THROUGH WHICH A 05
TALL, DOMES-SHAPED OBJECT WAS BEING PROJECTED, TWO CONCAVE DISH-SHAPED RINGS OF 06
TOGETHER AND ABOUT ONE-FIFTH AS DEEP AS ITS DIAMETER, THE DISC WAS NOT SHINY. 07
RATHER IT HAD A DULL GRAY COLOR, AROUND ITS PERIMETER AND A LITTLE INSIDE 08
FROM THE EDGE WAS A SERIES OF SMALL SHINY PLATES, WHICH APPEARED TO BE 09
EACH, WHICH WERE ATTACHED TO THE UNDERSIDE, AS IT DESCENDED AND ON THE UPPER 10
EDGE AS IT CAME TO REST IN THE AIR. 11
HAWKS CLAIMED HAD BEEN SIMILAR TO AN INTERMITTENT HUM SIMILAR TO AN ELECTRIC MOTOR OUT 12
OF PHASE AND IDLING, WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE DISC. ONE 13
OF THE PLATES WAS GIVING A WHITE SMOKE. THEN TO HANGS-5 AMAZEMENT HE 14
SAW SHADOWY FORMS, WHICH SEEMED TO BE MOVING ABOUT INSIDE THE DISC. 15
JUST LIKE YOU MIGHT TILT A WINDSHIELD WIPER IN AN AUTOMOBILE PRIOR TO TURNING IT 16
INSIDE THE CAR, HE POINTED "SOMETHING" THAT COULD BE SEEN IN PLACE OF THE PLATE. 17
NEXT HE SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A NEW PLATE WHICH WAS WORKED INTO PLACE FROM 18
WITHIN, AND HE DISTINCTLY HEARD A CLICK AT THE END OF THE OPERATION. THE 19
INTERMITTENT HUM INCREASED IN INTENSITY UNTIL IT INCREASED A WHOLE OCTAVE* 20
AND ATTAINED A VERY HIGH PITCH. AT THIS STAGE THE DISC APPEARED TO BE 21
SURROUNDED BY A SORT OF SHIMMERING FIELD WHICH RESEMBLED HEAT WAVES, THEN THE 22
DISC SUDDENLY TOOK OFF VERTICALLY AT VERY HIGH SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM 23
VIEW. 24
WHEN HAWKS FIRST SIGHTED THE UFO, HE WAS WORKING THE SHOVEL LOADER ON HIS 25
TRACTOR, AS THE DISC CAME CLOSER THE ENGINE STOPPED. HE THOUGHT HE HAD 26
CONTINUED THE LIFTING OPERATION AFTER IT WAS FULLY ELEVATED, WHICH WOULD HAVE 27
KILLED THE ENGINE. HE REACHED DOWN TO RESTART HIS ENGINE, BUT THE STARTER WAS 28
DEAD. HAWKS SAID HE WASN'T FRIGHTENED AND THAT THE DISC TOOK ONLY ABOUT 29
FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR THE WHOLE OPERATION. 30
