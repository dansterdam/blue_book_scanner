SECOND SIGHTING
page 2

I took me three week to get up enough courage to call the Alameda Naval Air Station, they told me I should have reported it when I first saw it.They could not identify what I saw, I talked to one of the pilots and he gave me information about the lighting of the craft there, but was puzzled at what I had seen.

I then called Hamilton Air Base--I just didnt get anywhere, they just tried of making me an investigator or some one who could help me indentify what I saw,,, after talking to six different offices I gave up.

In the Bay area there are:
Naval Air Station 
Oakland Air Port
San Francisco Air Port
Hamilton Air Base 
Travis Air Base

These Air Station and Air Bases are all within approx. 45 mile radius.

There is a good possbly what I saw was 1940 or there abouta Sea Flane, being flown in over this area to go to Vistam. I mention that some two tail air craft were being taken out of reirement and put into service, but would not give me any other information.
