Statement of Lt. Howard, Jr. Capt., USNC 
At 2230 on 21 April, 1966 while on duty 
at 2-3 Division 1 was advised - NOTICED A BRIGHT 
green house shaped object, SLOWLY apparently visible
at a distance, HIGH Overhead from approx. 3 to 4 o'clock 
position. The object REMAINED Stable for approximately
10 minutes and then started to change in to a "rounded" 
"standare" shape. It kept moving from the described
position to a "jointed ball" no and stuck form. The transformation
took approximately (7) 7 seconds minutes. At the 
time the object looked similar daylight.
