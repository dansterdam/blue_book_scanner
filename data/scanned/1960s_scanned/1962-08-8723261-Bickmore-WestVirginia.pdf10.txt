About 28 August 1962
Deliverer, Argentine

About August 28th, a bright-lit 1960 was photographed' at the normal size, 23:00 hours, at the city of Dolores, Argentina. The photographer, amateur, explains that he noticed a strange object in the sky, somewhat larger and brighter than the evening star, and that he decided to photograph it. He used a Zeiss Ikonta 6 x 6 camera, with Konica film. The object took about 10 seconds to cross the sky, going from east to west. It gave the impression of being an elongated, cigar-shaped object, and left no trail. The photographer did not hear any sound. Also stated that the object was not an airplane, rocket, or satellite.
