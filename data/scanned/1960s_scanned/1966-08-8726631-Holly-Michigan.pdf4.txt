Dear Sirs:

I sent in a UFO report about four months ago. The sighting took place near Holly, Michigan on August 4, 1966. I would like to know the results of your investigation. Have you received any other reports from the same place? I hope that you answer this letter, since I believe that what I saw could be identified.

Sincerely yours,
