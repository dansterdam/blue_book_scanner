1. Reference your recent observation and subsequent photographs of an unidentified flying object. It was mentioned in your correspondence that you would like to provide more details of the objects. Our photographic analysts would appreciate the opportunity to review them. (The original negatives would be helpful). The two photographs you sent show very little detail and a detailed photographic analysis will be difficult. Request you complete the enclosed Photo Data Sheet.

2. Upon completion of analysis, we will return your photographs with our findings.
