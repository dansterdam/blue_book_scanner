13. HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

The text on the page describes an observed UFO sighting. It mentions a "small, round, dull red-white glow" that appeared and then continued with a "white and much larger" size. The observer notes that this was "actually hard to draw-since there were no visible means of propulsion" and that there was no "over-all appearance of rotating or gyating" of the object.

15. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE HELD AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT, MOON, OR LIGHT. ESTIMATE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT (IN DIAMETER OR LENGTH) FILLED THIS ANGULAR FIELD OF VIEW. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE OBJECT ITSELF? ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.

This section describes the observer's estimate of the angular size and apparent size of the object, but the text is too faint and blurred to clearly make out the details.
