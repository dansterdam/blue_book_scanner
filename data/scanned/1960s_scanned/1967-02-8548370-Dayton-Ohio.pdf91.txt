The image contains a sketch with a compass rose and instructions related to describing the motion and direction of an object or objects observed in the sky. There is no photograph present in this image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how the altitude of the object changed from the starting point. Place a "B" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass rose to show where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass rose to show the direction in which you last saw the object.

28. Draw 2 pictures that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
