Dear Sir:

There have been some unidentified flying objects sighted by residents in the Vallejo-Benicia area. We would like to know if there have been previous sightings in the Fairfax-San Anselmo area or Napa County area.

We have notified Hamilton Air Force Base, Marin County and officials there have referred us to your office for further details.

Also, any information that would be forwarded to our office that would indicate the general public is being contemplated as to how to report such sightings, what to look for, etc. would be appreciated.
General information from hi j area of these incidents would be appreciated. Any comments or suggestions you may have would be used would aid in an article for the paper.

Enclosed are some clippings from the paper. The clippings and any comments you can give us in reporting such events accurately.

Thank you.
