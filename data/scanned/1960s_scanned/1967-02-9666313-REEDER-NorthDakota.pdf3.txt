14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? IT DISAPPEARED OVER THE HORIZON. IT SEEMED TO FLICKER OFF SLOWLY ON EACH END, THEN JUST RAPIDLY AND SLIPPED OUT OF SIGHT.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: 
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: NONE
b. Color: CHANGING FROM RED TO ORANGE TO A VERY PALE YELLOWISH WHITE AS IT ROTATED.
18. We want to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how many times the match stick's length is contained in the known object. We need this experiment at the time of the sighting. THIS SEEMED VERY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE AS IT WAS A COMPLEX ROTATING FORM, NOT A SIMPLE SHAPE AT ALL. IT CAME FROM SOME DISTANCE AND THE ANGULAR SIZE SEEMED TO START FAIRLY LARGE AND GROW SMALLER AS IT MOVED FARTHER AWAY.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. I COULD TELL THE MOTION WAS LIGHTS.
