The text states that on October 23, 1963, the Tucuman Observer reported a "highly mysterious affair" of three objects that were observed high in the sky over Tucuman, Argentina. The objects were described as being totally destroyed at 6:35 a.m. after being hit by avalanches. Residents of Malagueno were awakened by the disturbance and confirmed the incident. The report indicates that a restricted area was established, and the Air Force provided a statement on the event.
