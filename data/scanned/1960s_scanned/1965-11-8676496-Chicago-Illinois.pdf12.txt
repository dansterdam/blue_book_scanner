The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page shows a business reply mail envelope with the text "IDEA SYSTEM" and a logo for "Deflection Thru Research".

The text visible in the document is:

Dr. C.D. Bates
Director, Technical Bureau
of Investigation
Washington, D.C.
