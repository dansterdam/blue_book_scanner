This is a report of the incident as we observed it.

At approximately 6:30 p.m. on 30 June 1967, I was standing in front of my home with my wife and three of my children. We observed a strange object in the sky about 2 miles north of us, which appeared to be hovering and oscillating back and forth for about 15 minutes. The object seemed to be metallic in appearance and was giving off a brilliant light. It was very large, possibly 50 to 60 feet in diameter. At times, it seemed to be surrounded by a sort of halo or glow. The object was seen by several other people in the neighborhood, and my wife and children were quite frightened and disturbed by it.

After the 15 minutes, the object suddenly moved rapidly to the east and disappeared from sight. I was able to obtain a series of photographs showing the object, but only one of them seems to be of any value as the others were not clear or distinct. Frankly, we are not sure what it was that we saw, but it was definitely not any kind of conventional aircraft or helicopter. If any further information is needed, please let me know.

Sincerely,
