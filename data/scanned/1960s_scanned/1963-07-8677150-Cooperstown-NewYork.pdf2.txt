Gentlemen:

Having back from Cooperstown, this morning, we sighted a moving object high in the sky at approximately 2:15 A.M. This object appeared to have an electrical or fluorescent type of light. Upon its appearance, a motor-like sound was heard which was similar to that of an airplane.

Traveling from East to West on a straight course, it made an appearance quite the same as the first for a distance of several miles, then disappeared from our sight. Within a matter of seconds, or so it seemed, we sighted another strange object in the sky that appeared to be stationary. Our sighting of this object was limited to a few seconds. Invariably, it will light up, ascending, and then glide or drift across the sky, rather than falling, and it was traveling from East to West.

One of the three or four of us that had seen these objects had asked that if, by any chance, our purpose of writing it will have been accomplished.

Sincerely yours,
