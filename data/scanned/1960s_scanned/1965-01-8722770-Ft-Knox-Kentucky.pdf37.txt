The Kentucky Militia Officer was driving hie auto on U.S. 27 near Fort Knox, Ky., when he observed a bright light in the aky near the aorth horizon. The light appeared to be moving in a westerly direction and came to a halt near the road.
As he approached the area, the light suddenly extinguished. He drove up to the spot, and then noticed a faint glow or light about 20 feet in diameter on the ground. This light seemed to be giving off a dull, reddish glow. The officer then observed a strange metallic object about 20 to 30 feet in diameter on the ground, which appeared to be the source of the light. The object was about four feet high and seemed to be constructed of a shiny, metallic material.
The officer approached to within 50 yards of the object and then it suddenly shot up into the air and disappeared from sight. He stated that the object made no sound and left no trace on the ground.
The Kentucky Air National Guard was notified of the incident.
