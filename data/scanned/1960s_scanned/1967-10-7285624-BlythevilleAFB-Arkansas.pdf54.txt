UFO Observation, 21 October 1967

Chief Security Police
Blytheville AFB, Arkansas 72317

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of
21 October 1967 at Blytheville AFB, Arkansas.

2. Your sighting has been identified as being that of a large meteor.
The meteor entered the atmosphere and broke into two pieces. These
pieces traveled roughly downward. The meteor was visible
for approximately five minutes.

3. The object was also observed by the crew members of three
different Delta flights, one near Alexandria, Louisiana, one object
observed, Texas and the other near Dallas, Texas. Also, it might
have been observed by a civilian near Blytheville, but there
is not enough information to positively determine whether he also
saw the same phenomenon.

4. Once again, thank you for reporting your observation.
