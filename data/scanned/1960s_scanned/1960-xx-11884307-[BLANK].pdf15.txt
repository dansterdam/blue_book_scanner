DAYTON, OHIO, WEDNESDAY, MAY 23, 1956

Flying Saucer Problem 
Reviewed In New Film

The subject of "Unidentified Flying Objects" -- that is, allegedly seen flying saucers -- is stirring up controversy again. This time, it is treated in an alleged documentary film titled "Unidentified Flying Objects." The picture was produced by RKO Teleradio Pictures, Inc., and narrated by Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, who was a former investigator for the Air Force's Project Blue Book. Ruppelt, a news feature writer, once worked there as a writer, and later in the Air Force on the UFO investigation project. 

Other newsmen who have witnessed flying saucers were interviewed for the film, which tells the story of Project Blue Book. That may be the first time TV viewers will get a firsthand account of the project, which has been shrouded in secrecy.

Another key figure is Capt. William B. Nash, a TWA pilot, who reported a sighting of a formation of strange glowing objects in 1952. The picture shows him stating his experiences.

The picture is being shown at the Stanley Warner Theatre in Los Angeles. It has been described as more objective than sensational, and has aroused considerable interest.
