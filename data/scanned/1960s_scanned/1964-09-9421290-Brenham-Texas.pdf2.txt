Dear Sirs,

I saw a saucer at Brenham High School and a student of the school, and Physics teacher Mr. Yancey, observed it also. The saucer was circular in shape and about 30 feet in diameter. It was hovering about 50 feet above the ground. I realize that nearly all can be reasonably explained. I don't want it to tongue in with my faith, but I must tell you of the incident that took place at Brenham, Texas, on Sept. 5, 1964.

As we talked suddenly, the entire area became lighted up and the object rose straight up with a light which appeared to me to be green. It hovered momentarily, then rapidly dwindled from sight. My car had just a short time before could not get over 90 miles, reasonable explanation for the incident.
