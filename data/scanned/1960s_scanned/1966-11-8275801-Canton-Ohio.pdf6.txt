The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and sketches. The diagram appears to be a compass with various angle measurements, and the sketches seem to depict the path or motion of an object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the survey line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

90°

45°

  B
   A

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" is the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. 

Apparently straight course A to B

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
