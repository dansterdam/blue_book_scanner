Sighting report

Date: August 5, 1960
Time: Approx. 3:45 a.m.
Witness: Carl Higgens, witness
Description:
Mr. Higgens was awakened by a bright light out of his window. He looked out and saw a round glowing object, about 50 feet in diameter, moving very slowly, almost hovering, at about 500 feet altitude. It made no sound and was traveling in a south to north direction. After observing it for about 3 minutes, it suddenly shot straight up at a very high speed and disappeared from sight. The sighting lasted about 3 minutes.
