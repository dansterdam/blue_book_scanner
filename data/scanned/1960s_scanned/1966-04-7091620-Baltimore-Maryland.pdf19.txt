[Handwritten text]
It was a clear night and the stars were visible. I was standing outside my home in Baltimore, Maryland looking up at the sky. At about 11:15 p.m. I noticed what appeared to be a bright light in the northern sky. At first I thought it was a star but as I watched it, I realized it was moving slowly across the sky. I called my wife to come outside and look at it. She also saw the object and agreed that it was not a star or a plane. The object continued to move slowly across the sky and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. The entire sighting lasted about five minutes. I would be glad to provide any additional details about this sighting if you are interested.
