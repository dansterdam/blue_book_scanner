August 31, 1964

Dear Sir:

This is in response to your letter of August 28, 1964. This was written in which you requested information concerning the passage of both Echo I and Echo II which passed over the New Jersey-New York area on a recent evening.

You witnessed the passage of both Echo I and Echo II satellites approximately 2 hours apart, and at other times you may first observe the passage of one and later the passage of the other.

It is believed that the Echo schedules are stable and consistent, allowing for observation of these satellites from the same locations just which may be overflight in certain time.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
