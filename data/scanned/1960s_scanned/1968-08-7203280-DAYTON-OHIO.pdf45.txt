NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION ON THE COMPASS THAT YOU FEEL INDICATES THE FLIGHT PATH OF THE PHENOMENON AS YOU OBSERVED IT. PLACE AN "O" AT THE POSITION ON THE COMPASS THAT YOU FEEL INDICATES THE DIRECTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHICH WERE THE PATHS OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "O", THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHAT THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED, OR ZIG-ZAG. KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS SCHEMATIC SECTION IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE SKETCH AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE MOVEMENTS OBSERVED.
