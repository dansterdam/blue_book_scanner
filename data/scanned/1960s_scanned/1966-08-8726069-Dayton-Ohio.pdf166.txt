The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the document describes the details of a UFO sighting that occurred on August 8, 1966 in Dayton, Ohio. The report states that the object was observed for approximately 50 seconds at an elevation of 23-45 EST, and it appeared to pulsate in different colors such as red, yellow, green, and white.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:
