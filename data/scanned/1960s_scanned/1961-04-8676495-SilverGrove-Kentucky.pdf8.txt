The image contains two sketches. The first sketch appears to be a diagram of a curved trajectory, with instructions to imagine the observer's position and mark points "A" and "B" on the curve. The second sketch depicts a landscape scene, with an observer standing on a road with hills and buildings in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the drawing.
