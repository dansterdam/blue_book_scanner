IS. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THIS IMAGE IF THE PHENOMENON. IF FILLED AND LABELED AS INDICATED, AND THESE DETAILS THAT WOULLD BE APPARENT FROM THE PICTURE REGARDING SHAPE, MOTION, TRAIL, INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE APPROXIMATE ANGULAR SIZE HELD OF KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT OR FEATURE AT THAT DISTANCE? SHOW BY DRAWING WHAT IT COVERED IN THE FIELD OF VIEW AND ESTIMATE WHAT PORTION OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE OBJECT. INDICATE WHAT PORTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

The text appears to be instructions for documenting observations of unidentified phenomena, including providing a sketch or diagram of the object and its motion, as well as estimating the angular size of the object compared to a known reference.
