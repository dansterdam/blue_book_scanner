House in Duluth, Minnesota, on December 6, 1967 at approximately 10:15 p.m. Clear night with a few scattered clouds. I noticed a bright light in the sky, yellowish-white in color, which seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. The light appeared much larger than an ordinary star or planet. It seemed to fluctuate in intensity, sometimes appearing very bright and then fading. It remained in view for approximately 15 minutes. I called my wife to observe the object, but she was unable to see it from our house. The object then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds.
