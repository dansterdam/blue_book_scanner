The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page includes a questionnaire with various questions about the observed object, such as whether it disappeared while being watched, whether it moved behind or in front of something, and a request to describe the object's sound and color. There is also a request to draw a picture showing the shape and direction of movement of the object. The text on this page appears to be handwritten responses to the questions.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes. Disappeared suddenly.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes - behind a cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
Yes - in front of a cloud.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - None
b. Color - Whitish

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with the knot, so much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have not performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
could not have been covered more than a pencil width.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing the things you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially indicate trail.
