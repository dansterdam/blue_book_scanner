This report covers a UFO sighting made by four aircrewmen of the 351st Strategic Missile Wing, Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, on 28 July 1965.  At approximately 2200 hours, the four crewmen, who were on a routine refueling training mission, observed a brilliant reddish-white light in the sky south of their aircraft, at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet.  This light moved in a northeasterly direction, making abrupt "zig-zag" maneuvers, and accelerated to very high speeds, then hovered briefly, before accelerating again and disappearing from sight.  The crewmen reported that the light was much brighter than the stars, and that its maneuvers were unlike anything they had ever seen.  The object was also tracked on radar at Whiteman AFB. No further information is available at this time.
