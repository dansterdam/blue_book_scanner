Transcribing the text from the document:

Mr. K. Talbot reported that since there was no record of large balloons being launched on that date, visibility through the cold did not appear to be possible. NCAR had carried out a test program in Phoenix and had selected Minneap-olis, Minnesota for the flight. The stipulation was that the balloons be manufactured in Minneapolis with the flight path controlled closely through the cell.

Mr. Lally reported that Raven Industries had been selected to manufacture the balloons and that Raven will provide several chase vehicles and will fly the balloons remotely and logistically arrange for a flight to make a non-domestic and logistical arrangement and to select sites as planned.

Action No. 3: It was moved and seconded that the Panel notes with interest the NCAR proposal for a project to be carried out this fall. The Panel feels the value of the effort should be further evaluated by other means. Miller carried this motion.

Mr. Lally then asked the Panel's opinion of NCAR's assumption of this type of program. It was the consensus that previous Panel advice to NCAR was to learn the art and not to simply be a contracting agency. In this case we are trying to simply use managerial and technical abilities to best advantage while still giving industry the opportunity to develop further and acquire more experience. The Panel recommends that NCAR's approach to the program and its handling are impressive.

Session adjourned until the following morning.

Action No. 4: It was moved and seconded that the Panel recommends developing future plans on a regular basis. Miller carried this motion unanimously.
