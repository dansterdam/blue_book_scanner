There was a Comanche type jet aircraft inbound from South
which landed at the Rantoul-Urba na Airport, 2200Z.

The observer supervisor, maintenance officers course.
As the aircraft was making its final approach, the observer stated he saw 3 unexplained lights in the sky south of his position. He stated he was told to observe the aircraft and that he did not report the lights at the time. According to the conclusion, it was a transient Comanche aircraft, but the observer stated that he did see 3 unexplained lights in the sky at that time.
The possible landing lights on the Comanche are located out in the wings and it is quite possible that they were mistaken for the lights that the observer reported seeing. The observer indicated that he had difficulty keeping his position while requesting his position, that he had just put away his binoculars, and that the lights were quite bright. He stated he couldn't give any other details of the Comanche aircraft, as he was concentrating on the lights in the sky at the time.
The observer said that the car travelling south at 60 to 80 mph. The aircraft passed close overhead and the lights on the car were as bright as the lights in the sky. The observer said they couldn't be any other aircraft in the area at the time. The light was not blinking, no sound, and no exhaust was observed.
According to the report, the aircraft passed through the area and was gone in a matter of seconds. The observer passed to the rear and reported on the incident the following day as he realized at that time what he had observed.
It could not be determined if this was a verified sighting. We drew the conclusion that this was not a transient Comanche aircraft, but some unidentified flying object.
