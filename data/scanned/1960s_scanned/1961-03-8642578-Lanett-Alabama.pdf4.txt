Sirs:

I was sitting in a swing in my backyard in Lanette, Alabama, on Sunday, March 5, 1961, facing west. It was around 7:30 p.m. as near as I can remember. I noticed a high silvery object in the clear course of sky to the west. There was no noise and no vapor trail. The "thing" appeared to be some distance above the treetops. My wife was a little late to have it pointed out to her before it went out of sight in the distance. 

It was going at a terrific speed. It seemed to be about the size of a medium passenger plane, but the lack of noise and the speed of motion, I could not judge the altitude, but the lack of noise and speed of motion proved it was not an airplane. Also, there was not any usual contrail behind it. The object was about 90 airline miles from Lanette. I estimate the thing could have been at least 12 to 15 miles high, or at about 60,000 feet.

A little boy said he had heard the thunder around 7:00 p.m. I have watched the sunset of them.

I identity myself as a private pilot, member of LaGrange, Georgia, Civil Air Patrol, residing at Lanette, Alabama.

Yours truly,
