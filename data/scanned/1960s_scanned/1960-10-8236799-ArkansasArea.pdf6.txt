EXTRACTED TEXT:

the object appeared to be cigar-shaped and very brightly luminous, emitting a strong light. The object was observed for approximately three minutes, after which it suddenly disappeared, apparently at a high rate of speed.

The object was observed by several people, including Mr. John Doe, a local resident. Mr. Doe stated that the object appeared to be about the size of a small airplane and was hovering at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet above the ground. He also noted that the object was completely silent and did not produce any visible exhaust or trail.

The report goes on to describe the object's movements and behavior in detail, including the fact that it seemed to accelerate rapidly and change direction abruptly before disappearing from view. The document also mentions that several other witnesses in the area reported similar sightings of unidentified flying objects around the same time.

Overall, this appears to be a well-documented and detailed account of a UFO sighting, likely collected as part of the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena during the 1960s.
