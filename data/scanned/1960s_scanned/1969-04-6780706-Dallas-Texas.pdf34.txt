The charts in this publication are a continuation of the Natiollal weather Bureaus Daily Weather Maps. They include the weather analyses and forecasts shown on the Daily Weather Map. the Highest and lowest Temperature Chart, the Surface Weather Map, and the map showing the 500-millibar contours.

The Surface Weather Map presents the station data and the analysis for 7:00 A.M. E.S.T. The tracks of low pressure areas are indicated by dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed in 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. E.S.T. The values are obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperatures are plotted above the station circles, and the minimum temperatures are plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. E.S.T. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete items are not assigned values and are represented by a "T" to indicate a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.
