13. WHEN A PICTURE IS TO BE TAKEN, AN UNEXPLAINED PICTURE, IT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY INSPECTED TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO OBVIOUS INDICATIONS THAT IT WAS MADE WITH A TRICK LENS OR WAS EXPOSED IN SOME WAY ON A PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINT. THE REASON FOR THIS STATEMENT IS THAT THE ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS REACHED WILL DEPEND UPON A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE DETAILS OF THE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF ANY POSSIBLE FABRICATION OR TRICK PHOTOGRAPHY.

14. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW, IF YOU HAD A PICTURE, THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE OBJECT COULD BE ESTIMATED, FROM THIS MEASUREMENT, WHAT REAL SIZE YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE OBJECT TO BE.
