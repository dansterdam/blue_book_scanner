The image contains a page from an old document discussing "Inflatable Structures in Space". It lists several advantages of these structures, including packaging ability, ease of erection, light weight, and overload recovery. There is no photograph present in this image.

ADVANTAGES 
PACKAGING ABILITY
EASE OF ERECTION
LIGHT WEIGHT
OVERLOAD RECOVERY

First of all, as has been mentioned several times, the packaging ability we have a million things built into it and we haven't had to pay for them. Normally, when we make a hard structure, if you put a thing on its, it costs you money. We don't need any kind of packaging about it. It creates. This simplicity results in reliability. The erection ability of space reliability usually is speed up. Light weight. This is one of the factors that usually surprises most people. In the aircraft field where weight is such a problem, it is usually very difficult to get anything much over 90 percent of empty weight.This is a very large factor and an important one. There is nothing giving or secret about it. We aren't varying any basic fundamentals. The reason that we can usually go to these extra light weights is that we anticipate the structural distresses of very severe loading, which we never make. If you get the metals down to these dimensions, they would be foils so delicate that they would be hard to handle. The last factor, overload recovery, is the kind of thing that is helpful to the engineer who works in this field. We anticipate how big the loads are going to be and make a structure that has a very large factor of safety. This provides more than he anticipated in the first place. When you operate in an environment, you have to anticipate more than what you anticipate.
