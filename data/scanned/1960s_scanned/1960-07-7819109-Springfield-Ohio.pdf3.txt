37.Was this the first time you had see an object or
objects or objects like this? (circle one);

37.1 If so, descirbe then what you saw under what
and under what circumsances did you see them.

I saw the which was above the house for about
10 minutes, it moved slowly across the sky, changing
direction slightly, then went straight up and disappeared.
Then two small onject appeared, coming from behind a
cloud, they moved erraticly and made a dipping motion
toward the moon, something I could not clearly see.
they then went behind another cloud and disappeared.
a brown reddish light did move towards the Earth for a
few seconds before going back up.

39.In your opinion, what do you think the object
was/were? Please describe in detail.

I think the object could have been a number of diffrent things. I
cannot say definitely what they were, but I know they were not
conventional aircraft, and their movement were most unusual.
sitting the moon, something seems erratic, moving towards the
earth, then back up, makes me think they were some type of
unidentified flying objects. I will admit I was quite surprised and
could not clearly make out the details, but I feel they were not convent.

29.Do you think you can estimate the speed or
the objects? (circle which) ABOUT mph would you
If you answered yes, estimate
approximately__________________.
