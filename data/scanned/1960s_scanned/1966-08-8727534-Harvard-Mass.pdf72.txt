Proposed reply to letter from May 8, 1967

Dear Mr. 
This replies to your letter of May 8, 1967 in which you request information on your observation of August 1966.
We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will file your letter for information purposes. At this late date it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that a witness report his or her observation as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force installation. This enables Air Force analysts to perform a comprehensive investigation.
Your interest in the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects is appreciated.
