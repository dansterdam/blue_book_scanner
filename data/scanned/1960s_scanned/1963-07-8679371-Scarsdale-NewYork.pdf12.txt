Gentlemen:

At the suggestion of a gentleman at the Air Force Information Center, I am writing to you regarding a phenomenon observed by me and five others in Scarsdale, N.Y. on July 31, 1963.

At approximately 8:45 o'clock in the evening, the six of us observed a bright light in the sky above my home. The light appeared to be approximately the size of a thousand feet in diameter and was moving very slowly in a northerly direction. It appeared to be illuminated from within and seemed to glow as if made of a silvery material.

The object was stationary like two objects joined at their bases. As it moved overhead, it appeared to be approximately the size of a thousand feet across. After it passed over us and moved out of sight, we all saw it suddenly disappear as if some kind of screen or curtain had been drawn across it. We have not found anyone else in this area who also observed it.

I would appreciate any information you could give me in regard to this phenomenon.

Thank you.

Very truly yours,

(Mrs.———————)
