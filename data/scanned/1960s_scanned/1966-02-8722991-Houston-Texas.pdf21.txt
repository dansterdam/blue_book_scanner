The shared image contains a black-and-white photograph depicting a blurred or obscured object or formation in the sky. The object appears to have an elongated, irregular shape and is situated against a plain background that appears to be a horizon or sea/ocean. There is handwritten text at the bottom of the image, but it is too blurred or obscured to be legible.
