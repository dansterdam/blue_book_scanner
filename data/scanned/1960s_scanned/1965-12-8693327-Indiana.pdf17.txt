Great Lakes Fireball

The truth of the re-entry of a fireball on the evening of December 9, 1965 in the Great Lakes area has been determined. The fireball was apparently a meteor or possible meteoritic mass. An observer close to the scene was Von Shelton Herschel of Ann Arbor, Michigan, who saw the fireball at 5:18 p.m. EST and estimated its duration at 3-4 seconds. The fireball was seen over a wide area and reported by some 100 persons sent him reports. It was apparently visible as far east as Toronto, Canada, and west to south central Iowa.

The fireball's path through the atmosphere was from northwest to southeast, passing over southern Michigan, northern Indiana, and northern Ohio. The explosion which occurred near the southeastern shore of Lake Erie was apparently audible within a radius of 100-125 miles. Many observers thought the noise was a sonic boom from an aircraft. The fireball apparently broke up near the earth's surface, though the exact altitude is not known. No fragments have been recovered.

The path of the fireball extended roughly from Lansing, Michigan, through Ft. Wayne, Indiana, and ending in the area of Sandusky, Ohio. The duration of the fireball was approximately 3-4 seconds, and the distance traveled was around 200 miles.

FATE on the afternoon of December 9, 1965 a fireball that must have been visible from a wide area occurred over the Great Lakes states.
