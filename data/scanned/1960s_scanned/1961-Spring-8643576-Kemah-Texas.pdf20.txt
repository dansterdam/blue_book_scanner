This was the only one about this time and at any rate we may have
been quite busy, as we had doubt that you know as readily what
else was going on around them. We gave very good descriptive
data, and read documents really said that we could not
have really seen it ven if some of the most beautiful
things I have ever seen. Nothing was close except the most
beautiful soaring thing I remember ever seeing, to move and
disappearance along the most beautiful soaring
movements I have ever seen so fast.

Please, could it be just some kind of normal military operation going on? I tried to avoid
that so did not get a good look at it not a circle mile machine
but not quite a triangle-and I have had quite a lot of time
my waiting-and hope on some good clarification.
