There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image contains a scanned document with text describing an observation of an unidentified flying object.

0.075 of the field width, or three degrees. As a reference, subtending three degrees at a distance of ten miles would have 1233 feet. If the comparison with the moon given by the witness is indeed an angular diameter of 1/2 the diameter of the moon at the same distance, would have a diameter of 75 feet. However, these size estimates are highly unreliable. The witness indicated that at the distance of the object, it would have appeared to be as big as the distance of a one-story house from the position of the witness. At the distance at which the object was seen, the subtended size would have a visual angle well beyond the resolution of the human eye; a point-source would look that big. The object had a blue-green patch of light on its lower left quadrant. His witness' diagram and description indicate a patch on the lower left quadrant. The objects seen at 9:00 PM by the witness and his rider through binoculars at 7:30 PM.
