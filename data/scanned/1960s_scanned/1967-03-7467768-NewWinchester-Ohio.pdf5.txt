The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram with illustrations and instructions. The diagram shows a curved line labeled "A" and another curved line labeled "B", along with a compass rose. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine themselves at the point shown, and place marks on the diagram to indicate the object's position relative to the horizon and compass.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
