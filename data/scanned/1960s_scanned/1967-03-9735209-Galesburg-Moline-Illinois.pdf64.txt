A.C. Higdon, a highway patrolman, reported on Dec. 3, 1966, the sighting of a "flying platform" with stairs. He said there appeared to be someone inside moving around but not through the object, which was only "about the size of a hot water heater."

Four days later, Joe Barnard, a high school junior in Bettendorf, Iowa, gave this recipe for flying saucers:

"You take one plastic bag, seal by closing fins at the top, obtain five or more birthday candles from a dime store. Glue the candles to the top of the bag. When you light the candles, holding the top of the bag gently that the bag will fill, it will carry the bag and candles away."

Joe said he sent up 30 on the evening of Dec. 3. Says his father: "There won't be any more."
