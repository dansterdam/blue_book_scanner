The object appeared to be fairly high in the sky, about 45 degrees above the horizon. It was about the size of a penny held at arm's length. Its shape was roughly circular or ovoid, with a bright steady glow that was white or yellowish in color. There was no pulsating or flashing, and no other colors were observed. The object appeared self-luminous and did not seem to reflect light from any other source. It maintained a steady speed and heading for several minutes before gradually fading from view.
