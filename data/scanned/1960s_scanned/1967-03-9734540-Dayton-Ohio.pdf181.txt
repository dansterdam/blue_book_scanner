The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram related to a UFO sighting report. It includes labeled elements such as "A" and "B" points on curved lines, as well as a compass-like diagram at the center. There is also some accompanying text providing instructions on how to interpret the sketch.

As per the OCR request:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were travelling.
