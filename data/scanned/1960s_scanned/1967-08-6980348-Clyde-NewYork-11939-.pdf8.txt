Report of Unidentified Flying Object at Clyde, New York
On 6 August 1967 at approximately 3:15 PM, I was driving along Rte. 414 north of Clyde, New York when I observed an unusual aerial object in the sky. The object was circular in shape, about 40-50 feet in diameter, and was moving at a high rate of speed in a northeast direction. The object appeared to be metallic in color and seemed to rotate or spin as it moved. I pulled over to the side of the road to get a better look, but the object quickly disappeared from view. I did not hear any sound associated with the object. I am a lifelong resident of the Clyde area and have never seen anything like this before. I immediately reported the sighting to the local police department.
