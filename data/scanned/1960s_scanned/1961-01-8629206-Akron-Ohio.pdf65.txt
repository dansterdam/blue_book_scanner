7. INFORMATION:
On 21 March 61, Captains Robert T. Smith and Earl J. Wolf, Jr. traveled to Akron, Ohio, in response to a reported UFO sighting.

The first task upon arrival in Akron was to locate the Pulliam Family who had reported a "disc-shaped" UFO sighting. The information was obtained by going to the city's newspaper, the Akron Beacon Journal, which specializes in the reporting of Unidentified Flying Objects.  

The newspaper issues of 26 and 31 January 61 carried articles relative to the "Pulliam Sighting of 21 Jan 61". The articles reported the reaction of city (Akron) officials relative to the report.

The family reporting the incident was identified as the Pulliam family, residing in the North age of Lake Nesmith, a very small lake in the city of Akron.

Before making contact with the Pulliam family, we inspected the whole area of Lake Nesmith. The family residence was located on the South side of Lake Nesmith, almost directly across from PPT Nr.

Established contact with the 5 on 21 March and arranged for an interview later on 21 March. The interview was tape recorded.

The interview recorded on tape and in general went along with a previous tape recording. However, one major discrepancy was that during the interview Mrs. Pulliam stated that she did not see any object or that her husband and children saw an object, as had been reported in the newspapers.
