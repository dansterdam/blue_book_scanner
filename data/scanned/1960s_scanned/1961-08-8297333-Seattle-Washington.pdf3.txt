Dear Editor:

I am an enlistee serving in the U. S. Air Force. This letter is unsolicited but I feel impelled to write you in regard to the incidents I have witnessed concerning UFO's.

As an airman, I took some pictures of a UFO which I believe would be of interest to you. It is my understanding that your office has asked for just such evidence from servicemen. Unfortunately the negatives were confiscated by an officer who felt they should not be released to the public. I am disappointed that I am unable to forward the pictures to you.

while no pictures are available, I can assure you that the incident was real and that what I saw were not weather balloons or other conventional aircraft. The object was hovering and then accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed out of sight. I would be willing to discuss this further with you if you are interested.

Thank you.

1st Lt. Air Force/Pentagon
