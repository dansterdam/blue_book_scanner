HEADQUARTERS
FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION
AIR FORCE SYSTEMS COMMAND
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO

Hq USAF SAF-OISB (Mrs Geiser)
Wash 25 D C

1. Reference the attached letter dated 3 Dec 63, requesting information on unidentified flying objects. Our records indicate no previous correspondence from him.

2. The following information is provided to assist in a reply:

The theories expressed by Mr. Hynek are based on the assumption that if there is intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe, that UFO's (Flying Saucers) are from outer space. All evidence received to date, indicates that the same natural phenomena or misinterpretation of
some visual phenomenon are the most probable explanations.

a. The Air Force does not deny the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. However, it has not been able to confirm or discover by the Air Force to prove this contention. The theories of some individuals between sincerely believe in "flying saucers" are based on faith. The Air Force, of course, bases its assumption on factual evidence and not hearsay or belief.

b. No physical evidence has been found that would indicate the existence of space vehicles visiting the earth. The Air Force, therefore, cannot accept the appearance of "flying saucers" as being other than some natural phenomenon or misinterpretation of familiar objects unless physical evidence is provided which would prove the existence of extraterrestrial intelligent beings visiting the earth.

FOR THE COMMANDER
