The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

It moved very quickly, and it was hard to see it disappear behind a cloud. It moved very fast. 

15. Did the object reappear behind anything at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes (X) Don't know. If you answered YES.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (X) Don't know. If you answered YES.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Hard to tell, it was very quick
b. Color: White
c. Size: Very little, the size of a golf ball at a distance.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object, how much of the object is covered by the width of the match. If you had performed this test, how much of the object would have been covered?

Very little, about 1/2 inch or less.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the object that you saw, such as any buildings, horizon, or especially anything that will indicate relative size or direction. Place an arrow to the side the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A sketch is provided showing a small oblong shape]
