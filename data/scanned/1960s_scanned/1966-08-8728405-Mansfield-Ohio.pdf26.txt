The report states that the pilots were flying a twin Beechcraft southward. The location was 223 miles southwest of Rochester. The pilots had been watching the reports of other airplanes in the vicinity, and after several reports had come in, they looked around and saw in the distance a "very large" fuzzy ball or light. They could not determine any details. The object was climbing to 2500 feet, and they thought it was at the same altitude or lower. It was seen back and to the left from their airplane, or just about due north. It seemed to be about 30 miles distant. They reported their observation to the Flight Service Station in Rochester, but the station said he could not see the object well enough to give a description of its appearance, since it was too far away.
