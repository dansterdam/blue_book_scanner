A round, self-luminous object, variously estimated as 30-50 gallon drum size, which moved slowly and silently toward me and hovered over the field to my right. It seemed to me to be a solid, metallic-looking object with a yellowish white (fluorescent type) light emanating from it. It seemed as bright or brighter than any other light present. There were no distinctive edges or surfaces as the brightness appeared to be fairly uniform across the whole object. There appeared to be no visible means of propulsion as it moved silently and slowly through the sky. It was much brighter than any other light present, where there were no distinctive edges or surfaces, the brightness appeared fairly uniform across the whole object.
