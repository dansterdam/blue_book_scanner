INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL PERTINENT AND WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THE SPECIFIC POINTS OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE OR A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF YOUR SIGHTING:

I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT OUT OF MY WINDOW THAT WAS MOVING AWFULLY FAST. IT WAS ABOUT 6:45 AM AND I HAD JUST FINISHING GETTING DRESSED FOR WORK. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A PLANE, BUT AS I WATCHED IT I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOT MAKING ANY NOISE AND ITS SPEED WAS FAR GREATER THAN ANY PLANE I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT SEEMED TO ACCELERATE AND THEN MAKE A SHARP TURN. THE SHAPE SIZE AND MOVEMENTS WERE UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. HE SAID, "SURE IT IS. I SAID, "NO IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE A UFO!" AND HE SAID, "LOOKS LIKE YOUR BOSS IS GOING TO BEAT YOU TO WORK TODAY!" WE BOTH WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 5 MIN. AND THEN IT SEEMED TO GO BEHIND SOME CLOUDS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE AND I KNOW WHAT I SAW WAS NOT A NORMAL AIRCRAFT. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD CHECK INTO THIS. THANK YOU.
