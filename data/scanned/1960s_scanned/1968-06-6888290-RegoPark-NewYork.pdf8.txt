The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch of an object, possibly a UFO or some other aerial phenomenon. The sketch shows a curved, elongated shape with some additional markings or annotations around it. There is also some handwritten text describing the object and the observed characteristics.

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

"Started as a fight.

What was the angular size, hold a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a street lamp. Read the match, express in degrees, and perform this experiment at the time of the sighting. Estimate what fraction of the angular size of that known object was covered by the phenomenon.

DC was the size of a pin head without definitely bigger or smaller, then with the binoculars half half hollowed half at arms length."
