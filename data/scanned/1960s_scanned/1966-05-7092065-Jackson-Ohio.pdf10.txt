U.F.O. Observation
(on 3*15*66)
This report Is being mad√©  W.C.
With reference to my observation of what I believe to be
an Unidentified Flying Object, on the night of 3-15-66 at approx:
10:15 p.m., while driving home alone, about 12 miles N.E. of
Jackson, Ohio.
The object in question appeared to be hovering approx: 100 yd's
(yards) off the road, about 30 ft. above the ground. It was round
in shape, and appeared to be approx: 25 ft. in diameter. It had
a white glowing light around its entire rim, and a bright white
light in the center which appeared to be pulsating. The object
was not making any sound whatsoever.

I observed the object for approx: 1 minute before it appeared
to make a very rapid and sudden change in direction and speed,
heading in a N.N.E. direction, at a very rapid rate of speed.
It disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. 

I am a sober, intelligent person and I realize that what I observed
may be quite unusual, but I can assure you that I am telling the
absolute truth, to the best of my knowledge and recollection.
I would like to cooperate fully with your department in any way that
I can, as I feel this is a matter of great importance and should be
thoroughly investigated.

Thanking you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Respectfully yours,

(Signed)
