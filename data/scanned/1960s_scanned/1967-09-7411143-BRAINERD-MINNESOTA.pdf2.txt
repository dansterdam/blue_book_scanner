Because of an error, your sighting was not investigated immediately. As  
indicated, your letter stated that you witnessed a silvery, disc-shaped  
object at approximately 4:00 PM. We regret the delay in investigating  
this as it has kept us from investigating your observation. However, if you  
would complete the enclosed AF Form 117 we will investigate your sighting in an attempt to determine the cause for your observation.
