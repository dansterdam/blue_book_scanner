SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

REFS: ATIC (PTM)

1. An investigation of an unidentified flying object was made on 19, 20, and 21 December 1962, on the basis of attachment 1 to this report.

2. The following military and civilian organizations were contacted during the course of the investigation, and all willingly cooperated, and provided as much assistance as possible:

a. Provost Marshal's Office, Fort Ord, California.
b. Department 7, 15th Weather Sqdn, USAF, Fritzsche Field, Fort Ord, California.
c. US Naval Air Facility, Monterey, California.
d. Monterey County Sheriff's Office, Salinas, California, and Sub-California, US Attorney and Judge City, Salinas.
e. Police Departments of King City, Greenfield, Soledad and Gonzales, California.
f. FAA Weather Station, Salinas, California Airport.
g. California State Division of Forestry, 480 Calle Principale, Monterey, California.

3. Description of the object was consistent, except for some minor variations. The object was round, varied in size from a dinner plate (10 - 12 inches). There was only one observed at a time. The object was observed to hover, make vertical ascents, and move in a diagonal direction. A faint glow from the object was attributed to ground fog; there was no sound. One observer related that in Soledad the object was followed by a larger and brighter object that he believed could have been causing squelch on the police radio.

4. Observers first noted the object because of its very bright light. Two observers at Fort Ord believed it to be a very bright star or planet.
