It's No Meteor, That's Echo I Flitting By
According to the latest reports, Echo I, the inflatable satellite launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on Aug. 12, 1960, is now visible to the naked eye over the Dayton area as a small bright object traveling slowly across the sky. This 100-foot diameter satellite, launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., is being used to bounce radio signals around the world. It is now about 1,000 miles from the earth and will soon be visible each clear evening about 20 minutes after sunset, traveling generally from the west to the east. Echo I appears as a star that is brighter than the stars around it. It takes about 10 minutes to cross the sky. If you watch, you may also see a faint trail behind the satellite. This is caused by the ionized gas in the satellite's wake reflecting sunlight.
