NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1

CONCLUSION: Objects were lights, yellow to white, red, green at different times. Appeared 20-30 degrees off horizon in the east. Disappeared in the west. Object hovered for 15 minutes. Apparently the sighting was of an aircraft. A B-52 bomber on a training flight at 20,000 ft heading west then 180 degrees turn to east was in the area at the time of the sighting. Secondly, the aircraft lights disappeared as the observers picked up a bright star, probably JUPITER. This would account for the one light disappearing any the other sighting to hover for 14 minutes.
