The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

The text in the document reads as follows:

(b) The sightings could have been caused by particular meteorological conditions, or by the reflections of lights from the ground or hills etc. The high winds and thunderstorms in the area could also have been factors.

(c) The objects when sighted were almost in line with the setting sun. This suggested to the observer that the "sightings" took place at the time of the setting, with many thunderstorms in the area.

1. The objects did not appear to approach the observers. This violated the perspective and no solid objects were seen.

2. Existence of physical evidence: (a) No indications were found which could be interpreted as physical evidence in the environment where the sightings took place. The trees, bushes etc. were not damaged or disturbed in any way, and no residue or markings were found on the ground.

3. The attended roll of film is undeveloped and should be secured for further processing.
