DID THE PHENOMENON
1. STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
RISE UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?

WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
It seemed to be a little brighter than the surrounding light. I was ready to go. It was so close and bright there, I just couldn't help but notice it. It was about two inches in diameter in the sky.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It simply glided slowly off to my right then picked up tremendous speed and took off heading out to the west.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE IN RELATION TO OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
Yes, it flew past a tree.
