Dear Major Jacks:

On 12 October 1964 I received your letter of 7 October 1964 which acknowledged receipt of the request I made to your office regarding a Somerville sighting report mistakenly attributed to Fosterdale, New York. Thank you for your assistance in this matter. As I indicated in my previous letter, you are referring to:

My request for a meeting is to repeat a request made by me in my letter to you of 13 October 1964. Please disregard this request as it has now been taken care of directly with other Air Force agencies.

I would appreciate it so much if you would answer these other questions as well, but I am especially interested in receiving the copy of the letter you sent to me via APSD (RPI) in September 1964. Thanks again for your help. I hope to hear from your office soon.

Sincerely,
