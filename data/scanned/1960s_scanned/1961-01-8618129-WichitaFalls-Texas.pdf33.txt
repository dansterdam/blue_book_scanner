The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a blank page with a text block that takes up the majority of the space.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

Although gradually diminishing in light intensity, the object, according to the witnesses, could be clearly seen in the sky, and its position was not changing. However, it was red in color and had a definite shape, and this appearance did not conform to the light quality usually associated with searchlights and aircraft. The sighting lasted for approximately 20 minutes and the object disappeared gradually.
