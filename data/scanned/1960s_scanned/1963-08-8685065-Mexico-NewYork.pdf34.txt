The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document from the Project Blue Book UFO report.

The object was about 15 feet tall
It was a perfect circle
The witness described the object in detail, including that it was hovering, making no sound, and had bright lights on the side and bottom. The object then suddenly accelerated and disappeared.
The witness did not fall for the object as he was driving on the road in Waterboro, New York.
The document ends with "Thank You" and some additional handwritten notes.
