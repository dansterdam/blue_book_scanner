MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: Telephone conversation with Col Pullen, Hq SAC
On 22 October 1959 at 1230 hours, Col Quintanilla telephone Col Pullen, Hq SAC, autovan 631-4300 (regular ext 2823, however he was at 4336). Col Pullen wanted a brief run down on the Minot sightings. Col Quintanilla told Col Pullen that he thought the airborne radar receiver might also have caused the blip since it occurred for only a short period of time. The weather could have been a factor since there was an inversion. Also, the complete flight path is listed as having occurred for almost 30 minutes and fifteen minutes. I feel that some of the men were looking at celestial bodies because of the inversion, causing scintillation. There were a number of stars in the area at the time. Col Pullen said he would, however we have to get the times. This business of two hours is too long to make an accurate report. There was an inversion between 7 and 9 and later. I'm (Col Quintanilla) guessing under it was some ground interference that also caused the blip or because of the inversion he might have also picked up an anomalous blip. Unfortunately, Col Berlich wasn't able to have this pull a quick inspection of the set. Col Pullen wanted to know if we sent anybody up there to investigate the sighting. We did not, we sent myself, an assistant, a secretary and an admin sergeant. I talked to Col Berlich for over thirty minutes and since this didn't appear to unusual, I didn't send anyone up. As I said, Col Quintanilla send a preliminary report didn't get the thig over to General Stewart to get this thing slammed down. Send it 330 SAC, attention Col Pullen. He requested that Col Quintanilla hit a little heavy on go that he could give it to someone like this would help to comply with the issue down.
