seen in flight, coming to an almost dead halt, then ranging
down the heavens in equally great bursts, not - or so it
seemed to me - slowing but continuing to "shower"speed imediately.
still later, I noticed a group of these lights behind these two. 
They also were of the same coloring as the other two with the
exception of the one - which told me they were not stars -
moving off by itself in spurts. Its movement reminded me of
some object magnetized, being jerked across the heavens. This
one swung around until it faced approximately due west from where
I stood. It grew from a lack-lustre orange-white to a brilliant
blue-white.
In all this maneuvering, there was absolutely no sound.
The other peculiar thing was these two foremost ones which
gave off an incandescent powderish something that floated loose
and for not as controlable. Whatever the stuff was, it vanished
within seconds of release.
At dawn - I watched this display until then and lost them -
I made a mental check of approximately how high they might have
been. Behind my bedroom are three telephone wires. At an angle
from my bed, where I first spotted them after the electric lights
were out, at approximately a 40 degree slant upward and gauged
from the ridge over which they seemed to be, I'd say they were
approximately 60 to 70 miles high, maybe higher.
When I first noticed them, they were in a string, like beads.
Later, the blue-white one began to do figure '8's. I have made
diligent inquiry upon possible explanations in or near this section.
There aren't any. I'm told.
I have been informed by [REDACTED] cry that these lights
have been seen over a course of three to five years back.
