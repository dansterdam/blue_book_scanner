NO CASE. (INFORMATION ONLY)
DETROIT UFO INVESTIGATORS APRIL-MAY 65

On June 14, 1964, a strange encounter took place in Detroit, Michigan. According to the report, a Detroit woman, while driving home from her job, saw a strange object in the sky.

As she approached her home at about 11:25 p.m., she noticed a bright light hovering over the nearby houses. She stopped her car to observe the object, which was approximately 60-65 feet in diameter and emitted a brilliant white light. There was a blue-green hue around the perimeter of the object. 

After several minutes, the object began to ascend silently and rapidly. As it gained altitude, the light became dimmer. The witness estimated that the object was at least 500 feet high when it disappeared from view.

The report states that the witness was 'shaken but not frightened' by the experience. She did not report any other unusual sensations or effects. The document concludes by noting that no explanation for the UFO and the strange sighting could be determined.
