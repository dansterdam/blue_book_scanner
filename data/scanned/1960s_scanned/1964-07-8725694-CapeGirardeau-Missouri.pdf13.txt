EVALUATION OF INCIDENT

This incident occurred on 28 July 1964 at 2300 hrs at Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The witness, a police officer, reported observing a bright light in the sky which disappeared rapidly. The officer stated that he could not determine any specific shape of the object due to the brightness of the light, but that it appeared to be moving rapidly and silently.

The brightness of the light and the rate of speed at which it disappeared suggest that the object was not an aircraft, satellite, or meteor. The witness was unable to determine conclusively the nature of the object, but felt it was an unidentified flying object.

This report has been filed in Project Blue Book but no further investigation is planned at this time.
