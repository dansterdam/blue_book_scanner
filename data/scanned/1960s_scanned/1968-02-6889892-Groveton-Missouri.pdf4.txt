Here is the text from the document:

"Dear Sir, the time has come when I cannot longer withhold this report on the facts as I know them regarding a close encounter - (We mentioned this to some friends who said, perhaps the wise course would be to submit this confidentially, anonymously, as all kinds of unpleasant consequences can follow its public disclosure, and the possibility of harm to one's self or family should be considered.) 

I was motioned by a being, who looked me in the eye, and the light was so bright it literally paralyzed me. It was a most unusual experience, and the being seemed to communicate with me, though no words were spoken. I felt a degree of what I can only describe as awe and humility - nothing like the usual stage-managed, Hollywood type. The being then gave me a single pointed gesture which seemed to mean, "Go on about your business, this encounter is over." I have struggled with this experience ever since, not knowing whether to tell anyone or keep it to myself. But in our conversation with our friends, they convinced us that perhaps we should record it confidentially, for what it may be worth in advancing our knowledge of these strange phenomena.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]"
