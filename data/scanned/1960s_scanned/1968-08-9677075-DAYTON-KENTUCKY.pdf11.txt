"27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

At this point the sighted case was received at the Dayton Air Force Base and not even the report forms could accurately reflect the details involved. There was apparently no real investigation - just routine calling up of the witness and obvious effort to dispel the sighting as anything unusual. The right of the witness was obviously to cover up something and the report was written that way. The details were of considerable interest and yet were not properly reported."
