There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to show a page from an old UFO report document, specifically a U.S. Weather Report form dated June 6, 1968 from Dayton, Ohio.

The text in the document reads:

IMMEDIATE - U.S. WEATHER REPORT
FIRST CLASS MAIL

WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
OHIO 45433

The document contains information about the weather conditions, including wind direction and speed, on that date.
