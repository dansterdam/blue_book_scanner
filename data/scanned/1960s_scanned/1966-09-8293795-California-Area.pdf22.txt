There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document that seems to be part of a Project Blue Book report.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system output:

"it would please me very much if you could contact Joan H. deliittle of 421 Jackson ave, Panama city, Florida - an UFO investigator who interviewed me about a case involving sightings of strange lights in the sky over the Panama City, Florida, area. It is very important to me that you contact her or at least try to get her observations and findings about her investigation of this case.

As I told her, my interest in this matter is only because of my concern over the fact that there may be a case here worthy of serious investigation. After all, we must conduct ourselves in such a way that even those who do not believe in UFO's will concede that we are being completely objective and impartial in our approach. I hope you will give this your very special attention.

Sincerely."
