Conversation of Dr J Allen Hynek and A2C Corum (A.N.), Weather Observer, Keesler AFB, Detachment #20, Twenty-Fourth Weather Squadron (MATS) regarding his observation on 5/10/1952. 

Corum was not aware of the fact that two naval air station personnel reported an observation of white lights. They came in overhead, from Southwest and went Northeast. Corum saw four white lights, they came in overhead, from Southwest and went Northeast around 6700-8000 feet and were under cirriostratus. As the lights were fading into the northeast it faded into the clouds, went almost straight north, and then went into cloud and were lost to sight. Corum stated the lights were at an estimated 45 degrees altitude, azimuth 200-250 degrees, passed just to the North of zenith. The duration of the sighting was 7 to 8 seconds.

When the first object was called another observer, it was no longer visible when the same object was again sighted for a second time. The time elapsed between the first sighting and the second sighting was 15-22 seconds. When object got closer it looked like a dark oval, darker than the surroundings.

Corum was asked if this might have been searchlights on the clouds. He replied they didn't know of any searchlights like this, and weren't any water tower reflections which could distort the lights. The lights off water tower often reflects and looks almost the same when they disappeared as when they appeared, almost the same intensity as when they disappeared. The motion appeared to be a straight line path and then disappeared.

Corum was asked if he had any idea as to what he saw. He replied that he was worried as to what he could compare it to, and placed it up in the air, a large football with lights. This might look like a large searchlight calibration, could be described as an oval probably reflecting from the object. All were white lights, no difference in the intensity of the lights. He could not remember if the lights were blinking or rotating.

Corum never saw anything that resembled it. He thought it was an unknown. First thought it was an aircraft, but there was no sound or flashing lights. It seems between lights and weather conditions that night, Keesler has no flying at night, unless it would be Coast Guard a/c, everything on flight line grounded that night.
