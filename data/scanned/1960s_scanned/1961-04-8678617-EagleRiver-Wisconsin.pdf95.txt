Dear Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED],

Your letter addressed to the Secretary of the Air Force has been referred to this office.

The Air Force investigated the Eagle River incident and was able to obtain two pieces of the small cake mentioned in your letter. The cake was analyzed in the laboratory and the Air Force's findings are as follows:

This analysis produced the following findings:

The cake contained known carbohydrates (flour) and sugars, a stable milk protein, and contained no radioactive or unusual materials.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, astrophysicist from Northwestern University and special consultant to the Air Force, was sent to investigate this particular incident as soon as the Air Force was informed.

I hope this provides the information you wished.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
