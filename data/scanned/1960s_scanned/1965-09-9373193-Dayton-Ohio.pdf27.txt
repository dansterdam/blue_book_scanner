Meteorite Seen Streaking Across Sky
This report tells of a "bright light" that was seen "streaking across the sky about 7:15 p.m. yesterday." The object was seen by several people who described it as something "like a shooting star but much larger." It was said to have traveled in a southwesterly direction. Some witnesses said it looked like "a very fantastic object" and "something from outer space" that was very fast-moving and bright. One person said it appeared "about 100 yards in front of his house" and lasted only a few seconds.

Meteorite Seen (continued from page 1)
The report continues, saying that the meteorite was observed by other people and that the descriptions of it varied. Some said it was "round and bright with a blue-green tail," while others described it as "long and thin with a bright tail." The object moved quickly through space and was more or less continuous, with no sudden changes in brightness. The meteorite was burning up as it passed through the atmosphere, creating the wide band that was observed. Everyone agreed that it was an unusual phenomenon, and some speculated that it was a piece of a satellite or asteroid burning up.
