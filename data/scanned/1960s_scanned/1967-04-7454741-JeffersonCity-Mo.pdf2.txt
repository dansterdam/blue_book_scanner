Yes sir, I do.
and by the way I have a review of it coming out in the April issue of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.
I'd be glad to read it.
which, if you don't have a copy there in the library, I'd send you a reprint.
Well, if you would I'd appreciate it, but I'm sure the University of Missouri would have, but I'd appreciate a copy of my own.
All right, fine.
Dr. Hynek, I want to ask you one thing and I don't want you take this as an affront and get mad, but I want to ask you a very personal question about this. Do you think that the Air Force could be using this situation merely to keep a secret? I mean, are you being recorded now, where you wouldn't want to say that?
Well, no, this is all right, for me to say this. I have of ten wondered this myself.  
It would bother me if I were in your position.
Well, I've often that - afterall, I'm expendable as an individual - that it is always a possibility that Xh I was being used as a foil. But on the other hand, I've had no real evidence of this. If I ever come across, in 20 years it seems to me I would have come across some tangible evidence in the form of a letter that I stumbled across, or a communication that I shouldn't have heard and so forth, but I really haven't.
You can't say that that's ever happened. Well, here's what's bothered me. Have you ever checked into any Canadian incident?
Yes.
