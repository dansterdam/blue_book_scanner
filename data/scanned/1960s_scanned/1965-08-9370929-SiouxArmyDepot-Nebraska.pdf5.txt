CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING SIGHTING

On 9 August 1965, at approximately 1430 hours, a security guard stationed at the Sioux Army Depot observed an unidentified object in the sky while conducting a routine patrol. The object was described as a silvery, disc-shaped craft hovering at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet above the depot grounds. 

The object remained in view for approximately 15 minutes before accelerating at a high rate of speed and disappearing from sight. No sound was associated with the object. Weather conditions at the time were clear, with minimal cloud cover.

The security guard immediately reported the sighting to the depot commander, who in turn notified the nearest Air Force installation. An investigation was launched, and this report documents the findings.
