Dear Sir,

Thank you for sending the information on UFOs. I appreciate your reply.

Apparently a week ago while giving the news on a Radio station I came upon a news spot regarding a UFO stopping an Electro-Magnetic clock at the Azores Islands. As you probably know it was sighted by the Weather Bureau there. On the next news I mentioned this and another station in Portugal had an additional information been gathered on this?

Awaiting your reply I am

Sincerely,
Robert Plumb Jr.
