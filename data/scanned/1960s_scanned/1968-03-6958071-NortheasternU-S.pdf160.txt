MEMO FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968

Called: Lockborne AFB
Base Operations
937-4595

Talked to Sgt McGlocklin who said that they had received numerous reports of an object observed at about 9:45 pm that evening. Sgt McGlocklin stated that they compared notes with Major Connelly who was flying from Port Columbus and they compared separate reports under FM Wayne. Also put me in contact with:

Tsgt Boseler
1/4-7 Pine St.
Lockborne AFB, 43217
Phone: 491-4703

Time: about 9:45
Duration: 3-5 seconds
Course: NE

First seen: at angle elevation of about 60 to 70 degs as it dropped below cab of control tower NE or the base.
Disappeared: disappeared before it got to the horizon.

Comments: Although the observer did not see it until it dropped below level of control cab, he thought he would have spotted North of Lockborne AFB and South of Columbus, O.C.A. at Lockborne and Port Columbus tried and said that they did not paint the object.

Also said that Port Columbus reported at that time that a couple of others (in flight) reported the objects. Previous to this conversation that I had with Sgt Boseler I talked to Columbus Control over and they stated at that time that they had received no reports.
