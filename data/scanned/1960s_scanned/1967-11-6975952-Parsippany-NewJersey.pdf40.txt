PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT 11 December 1967
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: Lake Parsippany, New Jersey
DATE: 12 November 1967
PHOTOGRAPHY: IR QUALITY: POOR
1. PURPOSE: This report is in answer to Work Order Number 68-50 in which Lieutenant Colonel (USAF) requested identification of an object photographed at Lake Parsippany, New Jersey by___ (age 13) using a Polaroid "Swinger" camera.
2. ANALYSIS: Examination of submitted photograph and an enlargement of same has failed to reveal any identifiable object in question. Photographic imagery appears to be indistinct, blurred and lacking in detail to permit interpretation as to configuration and size of the image. Interpretation is further hampered by excessive contrast in the negative as to the object when compared to the background.
Objects held at arms length - i.e. from that of a half match head to the diameter of a dime - Building structures, information can at best indicate the object (image) appears one inch in length. Examination of the furnished information and results of photographic production no satisfactory explanations can be determined.
3. No satisfactory explanation of the nature of the object (image) can be made at this time from information supplied.
