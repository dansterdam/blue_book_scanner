The image appears to contain two sketches. The larger one is a compass rose diagram with directional labels. The smaller sketches show a landscape with a central object or figure.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

"IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION WHERE THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN, PLACE A "B" AT THE COMPASS ROSE ON THE DIRECTION TO THE OBJECT WHEN FIRST SEEN, PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE OBJECT AS IT MOVED IF SEEN TO MOVE.

THE DIRECTION WHEN FIRST SEEN, PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE OBJECT WHEN FIRST SEEN."
