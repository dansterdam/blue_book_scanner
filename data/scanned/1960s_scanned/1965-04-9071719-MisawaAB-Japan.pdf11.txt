SIGHTINGS ON APRIL 11:
11 April 1965, approximately 21:40 local, I observed targets visually on the scopes and radar appeared on the range at distances of 5 and 6 miles from the base. These targets were observed moving at various speeds and altitudes but always in a north-south direction. All appeared to be single returns.
The total number of targets was 9 on AST and 1 on PAR. The time span was from approximately 21:40 local to 22:57 local. The targets elevation and altitude remained constant at approximately 6 miles out from the course. There was no reported action taken on these unknown objects.

Witnesses:
TSgt Sawitz 
A/3C Jackson 
A/2C Woody
A1C Rupert (Radar Maint)

Tower could not see any visible targets when given bearings.

NOTE: These are statements by RAPCON radar scope observers during an Air Force installation branch.
