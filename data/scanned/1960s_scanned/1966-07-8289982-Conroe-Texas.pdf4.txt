There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows handwritten text on a page, which I will now transcribe:

I just want to say this has been a strange experience, to say the least. This object appeared to be around 3,000 to 5,000 feet high and was hovering near Conroe, Texas.

The object appeared to be around 50 to 60 feet in diameter and was lighted from the inside. The color varied from orange to reddish orange.

After I was over practically the same area, further watched the object and noted it appeared to be pendulum like in motion.

They only thing unusual, other than the object itself, was that when I approached to get a better look, the object seemed to move away from me. I watched it for approximately 15 minutes and then it disappeared - seemed to just fade out.

A report is being made of this sighting, and I will be glad to give any officials at Tinker AFB or elsewhere any further details that could be of help.

That is the essence of what occurred.
