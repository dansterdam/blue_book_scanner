On the evening of April 17, 1968, my wife and I had just returned to our apartment parking lot. The time was a few minutes before 11:00 p.m. As I got out of the car, a man who had gotten out suddenly called excitedly to look at something.

I got out quickly, glanced up, and saw a strange formation of bright lights. My attention was first drawn to a pair of bright lights, which seemed to be suspended at a low altitude. At the same time, I noticed two other objects, one to the left and one to the right just ahead of the pair of yellow lights. A V-formation of six yellow-white lights was formed by these objects. These objects were moving in a steady, straight course at moderate speed. I watched the formation as it continued on its course, the same speed and altitude. The only audible sound was a slight hissing, which seemed to come from the direction of the objects. After a few seconds the formation disappeared from view behind the horizon. I kept pace with the other lights until they way by the horizon.

When the objects were overhead (before I emerged from the car), I would have noticed certain odd aspects of the sighting. They moved erratically and abruptly, as if they were not bound by normal physical laws. The lights were of an entirely different character than those belonging to ordinary aircraft. They gave the impression of being intelligently controlled. I had an almost fluorescent quality, shining with a dim glow. The sky was clear. There were no other conventional aircraft.

My wife and I live at 15-C Charlestown, Apt., Bexley, Ohio.
