PAGE FOUR RJEYSA 31
DONALD D MANGINS, CHIEF, COMBAT INTELLIGENCE BRANCH, WING INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, 72ND BOMBARDMENT WING. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THIS SIGHTING WOULD INDICATE A POSSIBLE REENTRY OF SOME VARIETY OF BALLISTIC MISSILE OR EARTH SATELLITE VEHICLE. THE MANNER IN WHICH OBJECT DISAPPEARED (SEE ITEM B C) ABOVE) IS THE PRIMARY SUPPORT FOR THIS ANALYSIS, ALTHOUGH AZIMUTH ESTIMATED WHEN FIRST SIGHTED COMPARED TO AZIMUTH UPON DISAPPEARANCE COULD INDICATE MOVEMENT FROM EAST TO WEST OBSERVER WAS NOT POSITIVE OF THESE FIGURES, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EXTREMELY SHORT TIME THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED. BECAUSE OF THE SHORT DURATION OF THIS SIGHTING, DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT AS INDICATED IN ITEM B ABOVE IS NOT CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELY RELIABLE BY THE PREPARING OFFICER.
