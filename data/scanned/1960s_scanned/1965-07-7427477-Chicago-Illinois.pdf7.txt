July 16, 1965

Dear Sir:

This report is in regards to an incident that occurred on July 11, 1965, at approximately 11:45 p.m. in Chicago, Illinois. While driving home, I observed a bright light in the sky that seemed to be moving rapidly. The light appeared to be a solid object, and it was traveling at a high rate of speed. The object made no sound and appeared to be silvery in color. It was visible for approximately 30 seconds before it suddenly disappeared. I am unsure of the exact size or altitude of the object, but it was significantly larger than any conventional aircraft I have seen in the area. I am reporting this incident as I believe it may be of interest to your project. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
