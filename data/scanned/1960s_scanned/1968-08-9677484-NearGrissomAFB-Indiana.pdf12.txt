THIS WAS A FIXED LIGHTING, BUT ONLY ONE OBJECT SEEN. IT APPEARED TO BE LARGER THAN A STAR, POSSIBLY AS LARGE AS A LIGHTED WINDOW. IT APPEARED BRIGHTER THAN A STAR AND HAD A HAZY OUTLINE. IT DID NOT APPEAR TO MOVE WHILE I WAS WATCHING IT. IT WAS LOCATED IN THE WESTERN SKY. I NOTICED IT BY CHANCE WHILE DOING SOME YARD WORK. IT WAS VISIBLE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.

9. IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THIS SIGHTING, PLEASE GIVE DETAILS HERE.
THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY AND DID NOT CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS OR SHAPE DURING THE TIME I OBSERVED IT. I HAVE NO WAY OF DETERMINING THE ACTUAL SIZE OR DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT, BUT IT APPEARED LARGER AND BRIGHTER THAN A STAR. NO OTHER OBJECTS WERE SEEN IN THE AREA. I SAW NO TRAIL, EXHAUST, OR SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECT.
