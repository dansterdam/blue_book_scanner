December 27, 1963

Dear Colonel _____,

This is in reference to the unidentified sighting you reported to this headquarters earlier this month.

Your observation was discussed with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, professor of Astronomy at Northwestern University, and it is his opinion that the sighting was probably an astronomical phenomenon and he sees no reason to believe that the object observed was other than natural in origin.

The opinion that the sighting was probably astronomical in nature is substantiated by the fact that, as you stated, the object was stationary until it disappeared, which would be characteristic of a star or planet.

This, however, a further trail can be conducted as you suggest, if unusual circumstances indicate the necessity for additional investigation.

The speed of this object, as estimated by the duration of the sighting and 39 degrees of arc it traversed, is consistent with astronomical observations.

As appreciates your reporting this sighting since the Air Force is always interested in unusual aerial phenomena.

Sincerely,

HASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
Chief, Information Division
