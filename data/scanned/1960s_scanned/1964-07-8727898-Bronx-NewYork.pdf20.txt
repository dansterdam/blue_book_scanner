Dear Miss -----,

This is in reply to your letter of August 13, 1964, with further reference to your observation of several satellites during the past weeks.

From the information in your letter, we have determined that you observed Ecno II on several occasions, with the possible exception of August 5th when the time listed was 9:05 p.m., and our records indicate passage of Ecno II at approximately 9:13 p.m. It may be that you observed a high-flying aircraft on that evening, although Ecno II was west of New York City that night.

Ecno II will be seen in the early morning hours over New York; however, Ecno I may be seen passing over your area between the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. during the next week.

Sincerely,
