The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, containing a series of questions related to the observation of an unidentified object or objects.

OCR output:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the observation.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object of size. If you had performed this, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw.
