Heading North

Observed under 35x with 2.4 inch Altasinoeh refractor. It 
moved in a straight path from Jupiter to the star Altair, the 
total distance covered this short trip. The pattern showed first 
a pulsating motion, then a darkening and expanding. The object 
was about the angular size of a match. I have not yet covered 
this experiment by the methods covered by the literature.
