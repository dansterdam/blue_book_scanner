to whom it may concern:
The object was seen in the evening of July 19. It was observed rather vaguely at about 8:45 p.m. [sic] from our location. Unfortunately some obstructions of trees, etc. blocked a full view of the object from our location. We did observe, however, that the object was quite bright and self-luminous. It was intensely white in color and seemed to flare up for a brief period, then diminishing in brightness.
The object moved at a relatively high speed and appeared to be heading in a generally southwest direction. The object that flew over was quite high up, probably several thousand feet in altitude. It was flying erratically, making abrupt turns and changes in speed. From our angle of observation, the size of the object appeared to be rather small, perhaps about the size of a star or planet when viewed through binoculars. 
The color of the object was a brilliant white, very intense and bright. It did not seem to leave any trail or exhaust behind it. We lost sight of the object as it flew off to the southwest. We were only able to observe it for a short period of time, probably less than a minute.
After considering the various possibilities, we feel that the object we observed was undoubtedly an unidentified flying object of unknown origin. I hope this report is of some assistance. Please let me know if you require any additional information.
