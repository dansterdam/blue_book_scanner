12. Give a brief description of the phenomenon, indicating whether it appeared dark or light, whether it seemed brighter than the surrounding sky, whether it appeared to maneuver, to leave a trail, or to break up. Indicate comparisons with other observed objects, like stars, a light or searchlight, etc.

The object appeared to be a solid, bright light, almost like a star, that moved very erratically. It darted back and forth and up and down, not like any aircraft I have ever seen. The motion was quite bizarre, unlike anything I am familiar with, and I have seen many aircraft.
