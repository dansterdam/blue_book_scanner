Dear Sir:

In reply to your inquiry of May 27, 1964, we are unable to furnish any information as to the type markings you submitted for our examination.

United States registration markings for civil aircraft are preceded by the alpha "N" followed by one-to-five digits, one-to-four digits followed by one letter, or one-to-three digits followed by two letters, displayed in twelve-inch characters. We have no knowledge of any particular country using symbols as reference to their registration.

If we may be of further assistance, please let us know.

Sincerely yours,

R.A. Moody, Manager
