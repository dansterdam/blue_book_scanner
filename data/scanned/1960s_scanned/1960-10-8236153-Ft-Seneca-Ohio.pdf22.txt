The image does not contain a photograph, but rather it appears to be a handwritten document. The handwritten text covers most of the image, and there is a black scribble or sketch in the lower right corner of the image.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract the text from the document:

Come here to see this from (unclear) observation. There was a bright light in the sky over my house around 9:30 p.m., Oct. 7, 1960. It seemed to be about 50-75 ft. above the top of a large oak tree. It hovered there motionless for about 3 minutes, then started moving slowly in a northwesterly direction, slanting slightly upward. After moving about 1/4 mile, it suddenly accelerated and shot off at an extremely high speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. 
There was no sound at any time, and it did not seem to be attached to anything. I have no idea what it was, but it was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or anything else I've ever seen before. 
Thinking back, I should have called the police or someone, but I was so excited and amazed at what I was seeing that I just stood there watching it until it was gone. I have never seen anything like this before, and hope I never do again.
