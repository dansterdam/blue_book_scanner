The night of the incident there was a very strong wind accompanied by heavy dark clouds, and rather cool temperatures. My wife and I were at home watching television around 9:00 PM when suddenly the living room was filled with a bright light. We immediately went to the window to see what was causing the light. Outside we saw a large oblong-shaped object with several lights beneath it, silently hovering and moving in a straight line across the sky from west to east. The object was approximately 100 to 150 feet in diameter and about 50 to 75 feet in height. There were about 5 to 7 amber-colored lights underneath the object, and a whitish center light that appeared to be pulsating. The object made no sound whatsoever and moved at a steady, rapid pace, disappearing from view in about 20 to 30 seconds. It did not appear to gain or lose altitude during this time. The night was very dark, with heavy cloud cover, and the object stood out very prominently against the sky. We both stared in amazement at the thing, unable to comprehend what we were seeing. It was a most unusual and unexplainable sight. We have racked our brains trying to come up with a rational explanation, but can find none. The closest thing I can compare it to would be a giant inverted soup bowl with lights underneath, silently gliding across the sky. It was a most unusual and unexplainable sighting.
