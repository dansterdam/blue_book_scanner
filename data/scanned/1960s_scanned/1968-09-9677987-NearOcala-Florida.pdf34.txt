The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document describing a UFO sighting report.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

"and they seemed very sincere and a little bit shook up about the incident. They had it under observation for quite a long time and at one time they had two under observation; one went straight up and disappeared, the other one was out in front of them, bobbing and weaving around, changing altitude, setting motionless out in front of them; it was very off from them and so out a pretty good piece and stop. They had some passengers aboard but unfortunately, these people had their cabin lights on and were reading and weren't aware at the time of the object. Even down in the approach where I think they were at 3000 feet, they still had it in the approach area down at Palm Beach. We got some height finder readings on it; we had some printouts. I don't know if these were forwarded to Col. Quintanill or not. I think they were.

H Let's see. I can tell you; he sent me the whole dossier on it. First of all, here's the letter to me - it is reference the attached UFO report from Florida which occurred on 15 September 1968. Request you evaluate this case and make your comments on the attached Project Record Card. If you need additional information on the sighting, please obtain it. However, we want transcripts" etc. "Request this information on or before 30 November 1969." Then I have the regular Form 80-17 here, which isn't too helpful. There is some mixup on the radar it indicates they had some object following them, and yet the sightings all seem to have to do with things that were in front of them."
