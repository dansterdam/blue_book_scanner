Text extracted from the image:

The object passed over my automobile
The terrific speed of the object was
remarkable. The object as it passed
over my automobile went in a straight
line and made no sound whatsoever
The object at first had exceptionally
bright red lights. As it passed over,
the lights diminished to a dull glow. The
object was shaped like an extremely
bright star, but very much larger.
There was no exhaust or flames
emanating from the object.
