Dear Mrs.

About 3:30 p.m. on February 10, 1968 my girlfriend and I saw a strange thing without the binoculars, just look up in the sky.

It looks like a white light, at first a small thing, but it became more and more bigger and wider. After a few seconds it went back to the small size and took off very fast, we could not see it no more. It was very strange.

Please let me know what you think about it.

Thank you very much.
