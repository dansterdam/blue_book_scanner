NORTH OLMSTED, OHIO
OBSERVER REPORT 6 NOVEMBER 1967
REFERENCE NUMBER: 6975327

On 6 November 1967 at approximately 6:15 PM EST, a bright orange-yellow light was observed in the sky over North Olmsted, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. The light appeared to be in the southwest sky and was estimated to be at an altitude of 500-1000 feet above the ground. It was initially observed as a stationary light source but then began moving erratically, darting back and forth and up and down. The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. No sound was heard associated with the object.

The witness, a 35-year-old male, reported the incident to the local police department. An officer was dispatched to the area but was unable to locate the object. No other witnesses could be found in the immediate vicinity.

This report was forwarded to Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for further investigation. No definitive explanation for the observed phenomenon could be determined.
