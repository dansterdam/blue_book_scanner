SUBJECT: UFO REPORT

TO: Lt. Col. Robert J. Hipple, Jr.
Chief, Project Blue Book
Technical Analysis Division
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. I apologize for the delay in replying to your request during our telephone conversation in April. I was finally able to contact him on leave. I received his account of the incidents in question.

2. While he was on a mission during the evening of 8 November 1967, Captain Randall L. Teeuwen, the aircraft commander, sighted an unidentified light source at approximately 11:30 p.m. This light source moved and was observed within a five mile radius and was moving at a high rate of speed. The light appeared to be reddish-orange in color and luminous. There were no aircraft or other identifiable objects in the area at the time.

3. Major Vanenvenhoven mentioned the sightings to Chicago Center but did not report the sightings to Offutt Air Force Base. A copy of his report is not available for your file. Unfortunately, any other information concerning this incident is not available to command.

4. I realize that this information is very sketchy. Unfortunately, it is the only information that Major Vanenvenhoven could provide. Additional information revealed during this report will not be of any assistance to you.
