As friend since knows this case. 
as A resident in my mother (?) ex) mother was the experience i remember only very clearly. it was on a cloudy night about 10:30 p.m. The object appear at first to be about 15:30 to 20 min. It startled that it flicks 25 min. and the sound it can not remember whether it made any sound at all. the object seem to disappear back a into sky. a neighbor came the next morning the same time to my home and said he had seen same flying object. I would not identify this object as an aircraft i have ever known.
August 8, 1961 I advised - the closest settlement is a house on the upper on which it is only a mile. I estimated the object height approximately 250 feet based on the barn near it and the height of
the nearest forest trees - about 50 - 60 feet.
