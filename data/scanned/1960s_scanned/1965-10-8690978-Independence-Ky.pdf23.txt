Dear Sir:

A review of our October 1965 case reveals that the data on your sighting is incomplete for a firm evaluation. The case and brilliance of the object was compared to the moon. As the time of your sighting was about 11:45 p.m. the combination of the moon's position in the south and the object's description leads me to believe that the object descended and disappeared against the moon's background. In this instance the color description and changing intensity could be accounted for by the object's motion, its distance and the observer's angle of view. I would appreciate it if you could fill out the attached form so that these completed forms we will attempt to evaluate the sighting.

Sincerely,

DOCTOR GUSTAFULLA, JR. Major, USAF
CHIEF, Project Blue Book
