WRIGHT PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
Dear Sir:

I am going to tell about a U.F.O. I saw. It was last night when I saw a red light, it soon came closer, it was a disc-shaped craft with a dome on it. Then it went out of the glow out of the corner of the gone. It Minor changed course and went to Cherts. It soon flew out of sight by way of the Big Dipper. The light I sighted was 4500.

Do you have any explanation for this?

Very truly yours,
