The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that appears to be from Project Blue Book.

Q.S. my Sergeant about this U.F.C. was directed to light and me, but I, of course, saw nothing.Naturally, anything that will result in further investigation on the part of the Colorado office is most welcome.
