MEMORANDUM

REF. FILE NO.
DATE: September 12, 1952

TO: Commander, Post No.
FROM: Sgt. Homer Joe B. McCleaster
SUBJECT: Incident report concerning substance falling from atmosphere

Sir, September 11, 1952, this unit was dispatched to Madisonville, Kentucky, in response to a report of some mysterious substances falling from the atmosphere. Upon arrival, it was ascertained that at approximately 7:30 PM on September 10, 1952, a group of citizens observed a shower of what appeared to be some type of shiny metallic particles falling from the sky. These particles were reported to be about the size of a BB, and were suspended in the atmosphere for a brief period before slowly drifting to the ground. No detonations or sounds were reported prior to or during the incident.

The reporting officer, Lt. Hicks, was advised that this type of incident had occurred in the area on prior occasions, and that no further investigation was deemed necessary by this office. It is the opinion of this department that this was likely a natural meteorological phenomenon, and no evidence of any unidentified flying object was found.
