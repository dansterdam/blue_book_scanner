Gentlemen,

I am writing a report concerning several UFO's, witnessed by myself and several others who were with me at different times.

The first and most prominent one was an object I saw flipping, tumbling and rolling in the sky. The object, which I think was oval, was about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. This was on May 23, 1966. The object seemed to be glowing as though.

It glowed a dull orange-red, resembling a series of maneuvered for approximately half an hour.

It seemed to be looking for something. When I could no longer observe it, it had disappeared from the horizon.
