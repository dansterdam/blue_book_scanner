There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text in the document is as follows:

"We are definitely do have our signal almost entirely absorbed in winter. It is well known to all how tricky it is to the beat a maintained potential, which in the case of the radar reflections from Venus is the case in point. A formidable series of autocorrelation checks ran on electronic computers was necessary to mathematically the fact that in the total noise signal from Venus there was indeed very deep within it the faint radar echo. 

We are faced with a similar problem, except that of course radar is an accepted phenomenon. Venus is known to be there, and the people in charge of the project were all highly reputable scientists of enviable past records. None of these conditions obtains in the matter of the UFO. We have not the slightest notion that "Venus" is there in our case, and it seems highly unprofitable to expend vast amounts of energy and the time of scientists and engineers who might more profitably employed otherwise, in attempting to find an answer to the question "What was the stimuli that gave rise to these reports?"

And yet when this "malign signal" has been coming to us for the past dozen years at least and occasionally there seems to be a "blip" which rises well above the noise level, as in the case of some of the French sightings, one does indeed wonder whether the time has come to pay some attention to it. The role of the Air Force in the problem of the UFO in the past dozen years has been to limit visually with its ground mission, namely that of determining the potential hostility of any action in the air that cannot be immediately explained. Their verdict to date has been that whatever the stimuli for these reports may be, they have not been shown to represent any hostile intention."
