ANOTHER EGG-SHAPED OBJECT REPORTED

Albuquerque, New Mexico, April 26 - George Hitchopolis reported both seeing and hearing a strange craft while driving north from El Paso, in the vicinity of Metropolis.

Metropolis was driving north on U.S. 85, one mile south of the New Mexico 180 Junction, at around 10:30 p.m. when he first sighted the craft. The object was a luminous, egg-shaped craft. It appeared to him towards the right. It ascended to some altitude and then descended behind the mountains.

Metropolis halted his car and "searched behind the mountains", hearing a sound not unlike a muffled jet. The object was described as luminous, resembling an inverted saucer, with a glow radiating from beneath it that appeared to be exhaust flames.
