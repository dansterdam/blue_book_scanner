First one of our tele phone numbers and we were asked to keep it around what happened when at about 5:30 A.M. We returned to our sleeping location and told someone that had appeared when at 2:30 A.M. In the same direction, and pattern only higher in the sky again we said that was light that remained quite lit but seemed to darken it seems on its own and grew smaller as it moved away, till it cleared is scene again, giving no new appearance. We saw no evidence even the body that could have caused such a light, nor any gaseous effect. We hesitated to try to make another close approach for the glance of the object in future seeing and the dispatcher cautioned us not to do so it were more against reg, nut not to look ridiculous and discredit the possibility of a case that had not been contacted by the authority, so we still are not sure what that light represents. They moved in a strange unexplainable maneuver, that is quite difficult to put in the matter. But more will be tried out there with the assistance for this difficult tattle.
