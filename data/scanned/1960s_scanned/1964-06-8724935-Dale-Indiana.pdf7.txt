Regular Air Force Commander on Investigations for UFO's
The United States Air Force usually receives reports of Unidentified Flying Objects from private citizens who claim to have seen strange objects in the sky. After these reports are received the Air Force investigates them, trying to determine what the objects were. This commander, talking about the Air Force's investigation of UFO reports, states some facts about what the Air Force does:
- The Air Force maintains a continuing program of investigation and analysis of UFO reports.
- Reports come from all over the United States, and from citizens of all walks of life.
- When a report is received, the Air Force tries to identify the object reported, determining if it was an aircraft, satellite, meteor, or something else.
- The Air Force uses information from its own observers, radar data, pilot reports, and other sources to evaluate the reports.
- Most reports can be explained as natural phenomena or man-made objects. However, a small percentage remain unexplained.
- The Air Force is interested in identifying any real threat to the United States, but has not found any evidence that UFOs pose a threat to national security.
