There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page of an old document or report.

Before going further, I would like to present parts of an article written by Carol Lorenzen which appeared in FATE Magazine, August 1964, pp 27-30. (For those who are unfamiliar with FATE, it is a monthly magazine which prints "news stories of the strange and the unknown". It considers a wide range of information on UFO sightings.)

These are parts of the late account of the UFO landing in Socorro, New Mexico on April 24, 1964. 

It is a dry, rocky draw within the city limits, but isolated from the town proper. Only the tracks of two cars are visible on the spot. The highway, less than half a mile away, is hidden.

Although there are basic ground differences, the New Jersey site resembles that of Socorro in that the highway in both cases was hidden. As New Jersey by the woods. No houses are visible from the New Jersey site, they too are hidden.

The marks left by the machine are not entirely unfamiliar to experienced NICAP investigators, but they are still a puzzle. As another point of similarity, ground depressions found at both sites approximate impressions a little less. Almost in the middle of the area there-disturbance. The terrain, like at Socorro, is rocky and wooded. The area at the New Jersey site was circled and marked, and something from the scene was removed, as was done in the Socorro incident.

As in the Socorro incident there were no tracks. The soil in New Jersey was soft and would show something of the same weight as the Socorro craft, but make holes over twice as deep to make holes over twice as deep to make the surrounding area at all.
