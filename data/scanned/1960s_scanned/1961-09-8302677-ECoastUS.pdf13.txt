Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bailey,

Your letter of 13 September 1961 addressed to the National Space Agency has been referred to the Air Force.

This matter on a continuing report of a shiny object observed in the sky by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was among their sightings of unknown objects, but was not concluded as being of concern in the national defense. The object appeared to be visible up and down the Atlantic seaboard, and for considerable distance inland (the east coast, generally).

A further interesting note: your description almost matched a similar report from a vessel cruising between Bermuda and the U.S.

I am unable to provide an answer as to what could have caused the odor, but can assure you it is not from another source attributable to the sighting.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
