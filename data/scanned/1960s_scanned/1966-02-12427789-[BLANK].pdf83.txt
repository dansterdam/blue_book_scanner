The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO reports.

NON AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS
The following items are for internal use only and are not available for distribution to the public. These concern internal management and procedures for forwarding UFO reports to the appropriate agency:
1. Air Force Regulation 200-2
2. JANAP 146
The Air Force has no films, photographs, maps, charts, or graphs of unidentified flying objects. Photographs that have been submitted for evaluation in connection with UFO reports have been determined to be a misinterpretation of natural or conventional objects. These objects have a positive identification.
The Air Force no longer possesses, and thus does not have for distribution, outdated reports on Project Sign, Project Grudge, Blue Book Special Report No. 14, and outdated Project Blue Book press releases. Non-military UFO publications should be requested from the publisher, not the Air Force.
