CAPT/Lt Col Smith
Request information on the amount of cloud cover, height and type of clouds over Annapolis, Maryland for 21 January 1968. Anytime between 2030 and 2200 hours would be fine.

We are interested in seeing if there are cirrus clouds that might have reflected a ground searchlight. Your comments on this occurring would be appreciated.
