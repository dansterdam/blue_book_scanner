The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with a table and handwritten notes.

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
CHANGE DIRECTIONS?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE COLOR?
DISAPPEAR WHILE YOU WATCH?
SPLIT INTO 2 OR MORE?
TAKE A NO.?
HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

The handwritten notes state:

"It went out of sight rather rapidly and could flight in maneuvering directions."
