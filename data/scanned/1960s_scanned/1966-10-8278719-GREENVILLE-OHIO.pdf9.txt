IN RE TO ITEM 15: REFER TO COMMENTS ON ITEM 11.
IN RE TO ITEM 17: REFER TO COMMENTS ON ITEMS 11 & 12.
IN RE TO ITEM 18: HAD HE KNOWN OF THIS TEST WOULD HAVE BEEN THE KNOWN OF THE OBJECT, WITH ANY ACCURACY, COULD HAVE REPORTED THE OBJECT ONLY AS I HAVE STATED. MY TENTATIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT WAS IN THE SKY AT OBSERVATION.
IN RE TO ITEM 19: AT ALL TIMES, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A CLEAR CIRCLE. ON ITS OUTSIDE PERIMETER, HOWEVER, AS THE OBJECT CAME TOWARD US, I COULD DISCERNED THREE DISTINCT THINGS. ONE, IT APPEARED TO BE LIKE A MODEL A STEERING WHEEL. SECOND, A SERIES OF CONCENTRIC CIRCLES. THIRD, A HALO WITH THE INTERIOR WITHIN THE OUTSIDE HALO. I SAW NO WING VAPOR TRAILS.
IN RE TO ITEM 22: THE OBJECT IS APPROXIMATELY A CORPORATION LINE OF GREENVILLE. THERE ARE NO STREET LIGHTS VISIBLE AND IS IMMEDIATELY TO THE NORTH IS A 40 ACRE SOYBEAN FIELD. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED FROM THE BEDROOM WINDOW AND WITHIN THE SIGHT OF THE HOME AS WE COULD BETTER SEE IT.
IN RE TO ITEM 23: I HAVE DESCRIBED HERE THE SENSATION OF WHAT I PERCEIVED. I DO NOT THINK I COULD DRAW IT WITH GREATER ACCURACY.
IN COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE, I CAN SAY ONLY THAT A MOST UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE. I HAVE DESCRIBED REPORTS TO BE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL AS A 30 CALIBER STORY HAS GIVEN ME WHAT I FEEL IS A VERY LOW PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATING WHAT I WAS PROBABLY SEEING IN THE SKY. IT IS TRUE THERE WERE DISTORTIONS THAT I CANNOT EXPLAIN BY LOGIC. BUT THE REST, LIKE THE MOVEMENT, I CAN NOT DESCRIBE BY LOGIC. BUT THE REST, LIKE THE MOVEMENT, I CANNOT DESCRIBE BY LOGIC. THE INTELLIGENT MOVEMENT OBSERVED WHO AS RELATED SAID THIS WAS VENUS AND THAT I WOULD BE ADVISED TO FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING QUOTE: IN 2210 ON OCTOBER 9, 1966. THERE WASN'T THERE. THIS THING IS BOTHERING ME FURTHER, DUE TO WHAT SOME RELIGIOUS MAN EXPERIENCED IN THE USE OF OBSERVING AT NIGHT WITH OPTICAL PACT REGISTRATION. I'VE SHOT A LOT OF ARTILLERY SHELLS AND I USED TO BE A FAIR HAND WITH BINOCULARS AND INSTRUMENTS USED IN ARTILLERY. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T ENCOUNTER SLOWLY AND I KNOW THAT FOCUSING OF THE BINOCULARS IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T DO RAPIDLY FROM APRIL TO THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER. I HAVE SEEN ANYTHING THAT COMPARES WITH THIS.
