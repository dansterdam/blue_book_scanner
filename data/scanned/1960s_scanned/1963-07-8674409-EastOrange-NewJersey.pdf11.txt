Gentlemen -

For the past several weeks I have been able to locate 
and observe a satellite that passes directly over my 
home at about 9:50 p.m. every evening and at 12 or 
a few minutes earlier it passes over but much further 
south. I have been told that this is Sature VI but 
I can get no definite information as to it's distance 
out in space or as to what it's functions are. 
Will you please send to me, whatever information there 
is that I may use in my discussions and explanations
or advise me as to where and when I may get the desired
informaction.
I have been in touch with both Murray
Hill and the New York Office of the Bell Groupe and 
just this morning I was advised to write to you.
Thanking you in advance for any information that you
can give me, I am

Sincerely yours,
EAST ORANGE, NEW JERSEY

P. S. My apartment here on the  is an ideal
spot for observations because there is no 
obstruction, other than the mountains and
actually the sky is my limit.
