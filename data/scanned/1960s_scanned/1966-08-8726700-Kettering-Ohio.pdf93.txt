The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a Photo Analysis Report dated 23 August 1966. The report describes photographic phenomena of an unidentified flying object observed at Westhampton Beach, Long Island, New York. The report provides an analysis of the photographic evidence, indicating that the "photography provided indicates central attraction with an unidentified number of concentric circular or elliptical shapes" which are described as diffraction patterns. The report is approved by the Chief, Photo Analysis Branch and the Chief, PICCO Exploitation Division.

DATE OF REPORT: 31 JANUARY 1967
SUBJECT: PHOTOGRAPHIC PHENOMENA (UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT) 
LOCATION: Westhampton Beach, Long Island, New York
HOLZGN/075-2M
DATE: 23 AUGUST 1966
PHOTOGRAPHY: 
QUALITY: 1 - 35 mm color transparencies and 4 black and white 6X
PURPOSE: This report is being submitted by Major R. Quintanilla, USAF, requesting photo analysis of the photographic phenomena observed at Westhampton Beach, Long Island, New York, on 23 August 1966.
ANALYSIS: The photography provided indicates central attraction with an unidentified number of concentric circular or elliptical shapes. This is the diffraction/reflection system of the central image. The circles within the hexagon shapes are diffraction patterns. This is a perfect diffraction pattern.
