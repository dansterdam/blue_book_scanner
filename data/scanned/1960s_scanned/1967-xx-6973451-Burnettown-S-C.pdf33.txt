The image contains two illustrations. The larger one is a compass rose with the cardinal directions marked, and the instructions state to place an "X" on the compass to indicate the direction of the observed phenomenon. The smaller illustration on the bottom left appears to be a landscape sketch, showing a person standing in a field or road with clouds in the sky. There is another smaller illustration on the bottom right, which appears to be a zoomed-in view of the landscape.

GA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "T" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE OBJECT MOVED.
