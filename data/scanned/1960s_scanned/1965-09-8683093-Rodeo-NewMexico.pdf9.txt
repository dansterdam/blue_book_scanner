Here again we send the aid of a psychologist to help evaluate report. The report here concerned was not completed but (also) the case history was incomplete. According to the psychologist's experience, the psychologist has a real job ahead of him in evaluating these special cases. Psychological data can be difficult to obtain and the psychologist has virtually no facilities for dealing with these cases. Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
