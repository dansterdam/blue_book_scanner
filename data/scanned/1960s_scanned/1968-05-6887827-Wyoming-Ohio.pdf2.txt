The object was first observed at about 9:15 p.m. approaching from the northwest and travelling in a southeast direction at a rapid speed. It was a bright light, orange-red in color, and was larger than a star. As it approached, I was able to observe it clearly. It was round or oval in shape and appeared to be glowing. When it reached a point directly overhead, it slowed down and hovered for a short period of time, then sped up and disappeared in the southeast direction. The total time of observation was about 1 to 2 minutes.
