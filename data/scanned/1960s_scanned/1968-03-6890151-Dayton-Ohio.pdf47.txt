1. TIME OF OBSERVATION 6:30 PM
2. LOCATION Dayton, Ohio
10. CONCLUSION Possible (AIRCRAFT)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS Observers sighted a reflection of sunlight from an object. The observers could not describe the object except that it looked somewhat elliptical.
COMMENTS: There are always several planes over Dayton arriving or departing anything unusual. No one at W-P Towers saw anything unusual. No other reports were submitted to this office on a sighting at that time. It seems possible that the observers saw one of the planes arriving or departing from W-P AFB.
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE Yes
FORM FTD SEP 72-0329 (TDE)
