Dear Sir:

I am related to you the facts of an unidentified flying object I saw there in the early morning of April 22, 1966.

At about 7:07 P.M. E.S.T. traveling north on Quaker Road in Wappingers Falls, N.Y. we observed a bright, bluish-white glow object. It was 2 or 3 miles in the distance, traveling very swiftly. From west to east, it was sighted that I am sure more what can I say without it.

It seems to get larger the farther it went, and then it went out of sight in a matter of seconds. It appeared to me to be about the size of a basketball at the peak of its brightness. My daughter, Marie, and three of my sons were with me at the time and they all saw the object. They were just as mystified as I was as to what it could have been. We waited for a short while but saw nothing further.

My daughter Marie and I counted the time it took from the moment we first saw it until it disappeared, which was about 13 seconds.

I thought you should know this. If I can be of any further assistance, please let me know.

Sincerely yours,
(Signature)
Cortland, N.Y. 11720
April 23, 1966
