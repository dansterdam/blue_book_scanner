Why do you keep all this from the public? Why do you not allow this information for all to see. I seen a Force UFO form in the possession of an air force officer at Offutt AFB. I asked him about it and he informed me that these things are classified to be seen by only a select few and that the form I seen in his possession would be considered classified and I would not be allowed to see it. What good is this information when it is kept form the public. Security yes, but not from the general public. We need this information to prepare and protect ourselves. At the same time we as citizens can understand and comprehend what we are seeing and experiencing. Do we have to decode the world to protect us from an advanced society. It appears we are living in a controlled environment with very advanced intelligences who have a concept of safety which we cannot comprehend. Please give us the truth you know, withholding the facts keep us in the dark and leave us vulnerable. Answers to my question,
