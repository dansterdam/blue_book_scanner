TRANSCRIPT:

Fremont, Ohio
Sheldon, 6/22

I understand the reason this action did not come to my
knowledge in the beginning was that the call came to my
home and I was away from the office. About 2:00 PM
June 22, 1965, I received a call from Mrs. Sheldon who
lives at 122 1/2 West Main Street, Norwalk, Ohio. Mrs.
Sheldon stated that she and her husband had observed a
strange object in the sky that morning about 11:00 AM.
Mrs. Sheldon was quite excited and said the object was
very close to their home and moved rapidly. She said
they had observed it for about 5 minutes and that it
finally disappeared. Mrs. Sheldon said she had called
the police department in Norwalk but that they had
not been able to locate the object. I advised Mrs.
Sheldon that I would notify the proper authorities.
I then called the Norwalk Police Department and
talked to the dispatcher and gave him the details
of Mrs. Sheldon's report. He stated that they
had received no other calls about the object.
