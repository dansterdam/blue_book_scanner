(3) Observers account of weather conditions indicate that it was clear, no clouds, visibility was 9 to 10 miles, at ground level, which enabled a sighting for the following as relates to wind direction and velocity in degrees and knots as of 2300 hrs EST through 2400 hrs EST 25 January 1962. 

Altitude      Degrees    Knots
10,000'       170        12
15,000'       160        12

No aircraft from Homestead AFB, the Homstead Air Force Base Photo Lab relating to a Ground or Air Triangulation Survey proved pertinent. A report of distant aircraft sightings from Bermuda at approximately the same time of the sighting and other records have not been located to date to further identify or explain the phenomena observed.
