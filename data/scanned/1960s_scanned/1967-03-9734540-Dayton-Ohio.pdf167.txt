On the night in question, my wife and I were out sighting to see the low hanging Sovi ete Satillite pass over. As we were watching it move slo wly across the sky, we saw suddenly a bright light that seemed to appear, coming from the same direction as the Satillite. It was brighter than the Satillite and was more concentrated, with no blinking or pulsing. As we watched, it went down behind a tree to our left, and we could see the glow of it descending even though it was hidden from direct view. When it came into view again, it was a very bright and very concentrated light - larger than the largest star. I watched it drop straight down, turn sharply and move at tremendous speed in a horizontal direction. It then made another sharp turn and shot away to the north at a frightening speed, disappearing from sight in a couple of seconds. I was startled to the point that I did not notice exactly what color the object was, but I was impressed with its brightness and the fantastic speed and maneuverability it displayed. I tried to recheck the area where it had gone down and see if there was any glow or sign of it, but could not see anything further. I then turned my attention back to the Satellite, and it continued on its course as before, without any indication that anything unusual had occurred.
