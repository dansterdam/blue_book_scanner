Dear sir:
On the morning of April 8, 1964, at approximately 4:00 A.M., I was awakened by a bright light shining through my bedroom window. Upon looking out, I observed a very strange object hovering over my garage. This object was approximately 40 feet in diameter and seemed to be metallic in appearance. It had several lights on the underside, which were blinking in an irregular pattern.
The object hovered silently for approximately 30 seconds, then abruptly shot straight up at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from sight in about two seconds. This whole incident lasted approximately one minute.
I am a 40 year old businessman and this is the first time I have ever witnessed anything like this. I am quite certain that what I saw was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter further.
Sincerely yours,
