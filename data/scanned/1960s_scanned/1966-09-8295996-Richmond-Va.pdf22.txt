The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with text written on it.

The text on the page reads:

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 200-2. Refer to this regulation in the morning. 

One final note: Most UFO reports are rather routine sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more than the ordinary case, it will be more easily investigated at the time of the sighting than days or weeks later. 

Consequently, additional information and photos are essential. Will have the AF receive them.
