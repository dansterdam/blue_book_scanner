STATEMENT
UFO Sighting

On the 3rd of September 1965, a group of five persons appeared over a house and lot about 500 yards South West of Exeter, N.H. at 0200 hours on the 3rd of September. As they approached, a house cat was frightened and ran into the house. The lights were so bright they lighted up about 50 degree angle. They were so bright they appeared to be over a large field and over the house for about 10-15 minutes and then disappeared. They always moved in a straight line and then reappeared. They never made any distinct form to the object, watched these lights seem to come down behind a house and then reappear. Some members of the family said they could see the outline and seemed to be oval but not distinct. This was the first time anyone had ever reported a sighting and they finally discovered what they believed to be the object and reported it to the Exeter Police Station.
