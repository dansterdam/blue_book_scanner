REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

At approximately 0130 hours on July 8, 1966, Patrolman Timothy P. O'Malley was on routine patrol at Presque Isle State Park, Erie, Pennsylvania, when he sighted an unidentified flying object. Patrolman O'Malley observed the object from the east end of the Park, near the Perry Monument.

The object was described as circular in shape, with a brilliant white light in the center, and a colored, pulsating ring around the outer edge. The object appeared to be hovering approximately 100 feet above the ground and approximately 500 yards from the observer's position. Patrolman O'Malley watched the object for approximately 5 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight.

No sound was heard from the object during the observation.

Patrolman O'Malley immediately reported the sighting to the Pennsylvania State Police, Erie Barracks. The report was forwarded to the United States Air Force, Project Blue Book.
