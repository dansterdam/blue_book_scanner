The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present on this page.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 12 May 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I live in the northern part of the city, almost directly north of us is an airport. It has radar like any other airport. These objects must have crossed almost directly over the airport. No one else in the city reported these that I am still wondering if these objects were picked up on radar.

If I hadn't had binoculars with me at the time I probably wouldn't have seen this. The binoculars gave me a much better view. They must have traveled half way across the city before I spotted them. They must have traveled some distance because it took them quite some time to cross the sky before they disappeared.
