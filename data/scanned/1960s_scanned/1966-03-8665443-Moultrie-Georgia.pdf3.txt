Dear Capt:
The purpose of this letter is to report an incident that occurred on March 22, 1966, at approximately 10:30 P.M. between Dale City and Medicine Lodge. 
I am writing this letter now at the risk of ridicule, or being called a crackpot. I was not going to report it, because of the fear of ridicule. However, since I know you and have talked to someone of very intellectual people about my experience, I have decided to report it, and to inquire if anyone else has had a similar experience.
