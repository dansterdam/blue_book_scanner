Dear persons thinking UFO's were only sightings of Echo, note the following:

On November 1, 1950, 3 UFO's, three or more in number, were observed by 15 persons at Greers Ferry, Arkansas. The objects were described as being larger than "Echo", of greater brilliance, and white in color. They were observed for about 14 minutes, and communications were made to the Air Defense Command in Washington, D.C.
