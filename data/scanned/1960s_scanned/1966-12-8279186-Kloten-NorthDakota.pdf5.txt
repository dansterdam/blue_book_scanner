Transcription of the text in the image:

"It is rather did a shadows in the sky. 
About the size of the stars about the way of deg relates to distance. 
No 1, and 2 were much larger. 
About like a teal or less. It move very fastly, faster than weather planes. Much further away than I judge the stars. 
When it moved and the stars came around it was beautiful.
This is the best a can make and hope it helps someone."
