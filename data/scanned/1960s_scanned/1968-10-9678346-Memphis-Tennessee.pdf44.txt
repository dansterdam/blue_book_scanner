TO GO AWAY TO THE PLACE IS TO GO
 I CANNOT EXPLAIN WHAT I SAW AS I WATCH IT MOVE
OUT OF SIGHT GOING AT TREMENDOUS SPEED
ABOVE GROUND THE OBJECT WAS MOVING SLOW ENOUGH TO SEE DETAIL SHAPE APPEAR ROUND AND  ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL HOUSE GLOWING WHITE SILVER COLOR
WAS ABLE TO SEE IT CLEARLY ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED TRANSPARENT OR LUMINOUS 
OBJECT HOVERED FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN  TOOK OFF TO EAST GOING AWAY FROM OBSERVER AT SUCH TREMENDOUS SPEED THAT IT SOON DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT
