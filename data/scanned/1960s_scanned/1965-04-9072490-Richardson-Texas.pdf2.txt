Dear Sirs:

At about five to seven, as near as I can standard time) on the evening of April 18, 1965, I was standing out in the front yard at my home in the Richardson (east north east) at a sixty degree degrees angle. To show the direction of the object movement.

The object was of whitish silver in color and about 40 to 50 feet in length at what we could tell at its altitude which is estimated to be about one thousand feet. The speed of the object is unknown, depending on its distance away, but it did appear to be several hundred miles an hour. For the size of the object, as near as we can estimate the size, it would be about a thousand miles an hour. The object appeared to be hovering for a few seconds, then it appeared to drop one hundred feet or thereabouts, and then it began to move at a terrific speed, several hundred miles an hour, and even twenty degrees above the horizon, and then it began to slow down again after being out of sight for a few seconds. We are not the only ones who saw the object, which took about ten seconds to appear and disappear. Various other people mention the objects as hovering and dropping a few degree and gaining speed.

In our opinion, the object is not a satellite, aircraft, or any other conventional man-made object, and we are both well acquainted that this is not of Richardson and well five years. If you want more details either call or write to [redacted].

Thank you for reading this letter.

Sincerely yours,
