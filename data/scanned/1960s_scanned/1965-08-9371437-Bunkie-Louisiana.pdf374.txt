In my letter of Sept. 7, I said that the photos that accompany my report on unidentified objects or phenomena could be forthcoming. They are enclosed.

By photographic analysis, it was determined that photos A and B in the report were two different printings of the same negative, and only the first copy was more legible as printed.

I am most interested in your opinion of the nature of the phenomena that I observed.

Yours truly, yours
