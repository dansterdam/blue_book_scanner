In Argentina

"The two that seemed to have a bright flame were
dark metallic objects, disc shaped. The flames were easily observed. (They seemed to be enveloping the objects.) They were traveling at a tremendous speed which made it difficult to observe details. On two occasions they appeared to be firing beams which illuminated the ground below.
The objects were sighted over a three-day period and on two occasions were seen to drop or almost land but then took off again at terrific speeds. The objects were estimated to be approximately one mile in diameter."

So ended the first report in the A.P.R.O. Bulletin for July, 1962. The report described sightings of unusual aerial phenomena observed over Argentina during May 1962. No specific details were provided regarding the source of the report or further information about the sightings.
