TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

PROVE THAT THEY ARE UNIDENTIFIED FOREIGN AIRCRAFT AND NO PHOTO OR ELECTRONIC MISSION HAS BEEN DETECTED. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE RANGE MAY BE UNDER SURVEILLANCE BY AIRCRAFT BASED ON FOREIGN SOIL. HOWEVER, THIS APPROACH APPEARS TO BE UNLIKELY BECAUSE OF THE INACCESSIBILITY OF THE CAPE TO OTHER MORE EFFECTIVE MEANS OF OBSERVATION. THE RANGE AND ALTITUDES OBSERVED TO DATE RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE PRESENCE OF A KNOWN PERFORMANCE VEHICLE. THIS COMMAND WILL CONTINUE TO EXERCISE STRINGENT SURVEILLANCE OF THE AREA WITH ALL FACILITIES AVAILABLE AND REPORT ANY SIGNIFICANT INCIDENTS OF THIS NATURE. SGT-5
