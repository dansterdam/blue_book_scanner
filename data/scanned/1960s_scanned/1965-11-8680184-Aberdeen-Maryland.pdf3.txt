Cliff Saffo, Washington D.C.
Dear Sirs:
About 3 days after the light flashed on my farm and I rushed out and saw a strange machine hovering about 25 or 30 feet from the ground, it came down very slowly, almost smoothly, and set down to the ground. It was circular in shape, about 40 feet in diameter, and had no windows or doors that I could see. The entire object was silvery white in color and appeared to be all one piece.
It sat on the ground for about 5 to 10 minutes and then very slowly and smoothly rose up into the air and shot straight up like a rocket and was gone in about 3 seconds.
This is my personal experience and I thought I would forward it to your office as I realize this must be of interest to people in your field. I hope this information is of some value to you.
Sincerely,
(Signed) 164
