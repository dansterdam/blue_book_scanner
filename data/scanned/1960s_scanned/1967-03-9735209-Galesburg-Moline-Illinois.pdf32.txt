Sirs:
I am writing you in regards to UFO sighting and subsequent investigation of same. Other information concerning the object itself leads me to call and I thought it pertinent enough to bring it to your attention.

I described the surface of the object to be shiny and of a metallic material, but I did want to tell you that the surface, although smooth, appeared to have an overall peel effect. I will try to illustrate with a sketch below.

Furthermore, I asked the radio repairman what he detected to be malfunctioning in my radio station. The repairman said my receiver had a case loose from its connection and was the cause for my receiver not picking up my base station.

The lady that was with me for almost the entire duration of my sighting has made her identity available to me and I am analyzing it to you.

Mrs. __ might not relate the sighting in the same detail that I did, but I am sure you may are prepared to evaluate her information in comparison to what I related to you.

Thank You for your co-operation. I am sincerely
Bottino Ill. 51262
