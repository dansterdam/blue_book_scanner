DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, "PLACE AT "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENOM WHEN LAST SEEN."

TO BE SET ALL 8 POINTS OF THE COMPASS, CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN SEEING. THEN ADD ANY ADDITIONAL DATA, SUCH AS DIRECTION AND APPROXIMATE SIZE, THAT WOULD SATISFACTORILY SHOW WHAT THE OBSERVER SAW. UTILIZE THE LARGER SKETCH.
