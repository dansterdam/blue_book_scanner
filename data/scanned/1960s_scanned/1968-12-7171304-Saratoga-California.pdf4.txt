Dear Sir, 

I would like my mother and I to report an incident that occurred on the 23rd of December in Los Gatos, Calif. The object was a pulsating light, in shape, that lasted approx. 15 min. We were in a southwest direction and the object seemed to move in the air. We did observe the object in June and it was fairly close but there was no explosion, just an explanation.
