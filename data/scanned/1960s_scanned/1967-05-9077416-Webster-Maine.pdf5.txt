GENTLEMEN:
A SIGHTING IN REFERENCE TO A UFO(OR WHATNOT) SIGHTING. THIS SIGHTING OCCURRED ON MAY 1, 1967. ON THE 
OCCASION OF MAY SOMETIME THE PEOPLE WHO HAD SEEN IT REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO THIS OFFICE. PHASE I, WHEN A BLINKING LIGHT ATTRACTED MY EYE. I ESTIMATE .OF THE OBJECT AT ABOUT 10,000 FEET. IT WAS A YELLOW WHITE OBJECT. ROUND SHAPE. APPEARED STATIONARY FOR SOME MINUTES. THEN PIT-PITCHED SLIGHTLY AND INCREASED SPEED, THE ORIGINAL SHAPE REMAINED CONSTANT, I REMEMBERED THE CAMERA AND TAKING IT PUT IT WATCHED TILL IT STOPPED AND PHOTOGRAPHED IT. I DID THIS TWICE AS IT SEEMED TO BE POLISHING[?] AND I HAD USED TWO EXPOSURES. OF WAS STARTLED TO FIND I HAD RECORDED THE TIMIE JUST AS I SNAPPED THE SHUTTER. THE TIME WAS 9:22 P.M. 

THERE ARE SEVERAL QUESTIONS I WOULD LIKE ANSWERED:
1. WERE THEIR ANY FLIGHTS OF AIRCRAFT, HOVERING, OIL LEADING, AT THAT TIME IN THE AREA?
2. WAS THEIR A SATELLITE PASSAGE (IF SO)
3. COULD YOU (IF YOU CAN) SAY RADAR CONTACT ON THAT OBJECT?

I HAVE PHOTOS OF THE OBJECT WHICH COULD BE DEVELOPED. I WILL BE WHAT YOU MAKE OF EXPERTS. YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL ME.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. PLEASE RETURN THE ANSWERS TO MY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU, (YOU'RE DOING A GREAT SERVICE). PLEASE ANSWER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
