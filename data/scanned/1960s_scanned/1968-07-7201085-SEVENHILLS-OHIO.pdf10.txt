The image appears to contain a diagram or sketch, but no photograph. The diagram includes a curved line labeled "A" and a compass-like illustration. The text below the diagram provides instructions on how to use the diagram to determine the position and motion of an observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how the object appeared to move, and then place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.  
Show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
