11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer sighted 3 objects that had a bright green and glow. The objects were "dish-shaped", traveling at speeds near 1000 mph and were visible that time as 9 or 10 minutes rather than 30 seconds. One gives the direction as due north and was only visible for a matter of seconds. Although there are numerous conflicting points, since the witness feels that it was an aircraft, it seems that this was an aircraft.
