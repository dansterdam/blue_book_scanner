35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
On March 31, 1967 at about 10:30 p.m. I was in my backyard in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, facing north, when I noticed a light low on the horizon. It started and stopped and started again, descending until it was quite low in the sky and seemed to stop and hover. It appeared to change color from white to a reddish orange. It then seemed to start moving across the sky in a northerly direction. It stopped and started again, finally seeming to go out of sight. The object was visible for about 10 minutes. It seemed to be at an altitude of perhaps a thousand feet or less. The motion and changing colors were most unusual. I have seen many lights in the sky, but this was quite different from anything I have ever seen before. I am quite familiar with planes, satellites, and normal celestial objects, and this was not like any of those. I am convinced that what I saw was some type of unidentified flying object. I would be glad to answer any other questions you might have.
