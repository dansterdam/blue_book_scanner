1. Reference your letter, subject as above, dated 20 May 1966 requesting information on the camera of Mr. Cooper.

2. The camera, an Imperial Mark XII, is a simple box camera with an F stop lens (2.5 to 22) and the shutter speed will run about an F 7 or 8 lens to focal length ratio.

3. Mr. Cooper is somewhat hesitant about allowing his camera to be taken or sent to you for examination.
