The image contains three hand-drawn sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a series of ray-like shapes radiating from it, as described in the instructions. The second and third sketches appear to depict landscape scenes, with a person standing in the road in the larger sketch and a mountainous landscape in the smaller sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
