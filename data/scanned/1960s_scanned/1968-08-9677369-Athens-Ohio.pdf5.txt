The document contains two black and white illustrations, not photographs.

The top illustration is a compass rose with directional markers such as N for North, NE for Northeast, etc. There are two letters marked on the compass: "A" is placed somewhere between the W (West) and NW (Northwest) directional markers, and "B" is located between E (East) and ENE (East-Northeast).

The bottom illustration is separated into two parts:

Left Sketch: It depicts a side view of a landscape with a person standing in the foreground, looking towards a horizon where the sky meets a stretch of land or hills. The sky is clear, and there's nothing else depicted in the sky.

Right Sketch: It shows the same side view, but this smaller illustration has two letters "A" and "B" connected by a dotted line to indicate the movement of an object from point A to point B across the sky.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B", THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT
APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE
THE LARGER SKETCH.
