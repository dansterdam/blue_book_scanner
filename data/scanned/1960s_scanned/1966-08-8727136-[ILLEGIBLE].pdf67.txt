playing around, just tinkering with this unknown thing, cannot tell what it is as it is something very unusual looking, not like any other known thing, was moving around but not as fast as a jet, more like a light aircraft, seemed to be translucent around the edges and it had some kind of halo or aura around it, but could not tell if it was an actual physical object or just some strange lighting effect.
