[About 6:30 p.m. on January 20, 1966, a couple of drivers of cars going west on Highway 395 in California near the Nevada border stopped to observe a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to be oval in shape and stationary over the desert terrain for several minutes. As the light moved away to the northeast, it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. According to the report, the light seemed to be about 500-600 feet above the ground and approximately 50-75 feet in diameter.

A witness in the area described the object as being silent and having a blueish-white color. The report indicates that there were two other witnesses in the area who saw the object. The report includes a sketch of the object produced by one of the witnesses.]
