BANKS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING. MR. WAS ALONE WITH HIS DOG WHEN MAKING THE OBSERVATION. HE ARED CONVER-
TIBLE WITH 2 PASSENGERS HAD JUST PASSED BY AND STOPPED BEYOND A SMALL HILL. NO SOONER HAD THE NOISE OF THE CAR'S ENGINE SUBSIDED THAN THE OBJECT BEGAN TO APPEAR FROM THE NW. MR. STATED THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER THESE PEOPLE WITNESSED THE PHENOMENON OR NOT. HE DOES THINK HOWEVER THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT BECAUSE IT WAS SO BRIGHT AND SO UNUSUAL. HE WAS NO LIGHTS COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE CAR. HOWEVER, HE WOULD HAVE APPROACHED THESE PEOPLE HAD HE NOTICED ANY ATTEMPT ON THEIR PART TO SIGNAL THE OBJECT. DUE TO THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT CAUSED BY THE COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED SIGHTING AND THE EVEN MORE SURPRISING RESPONSE BY THE UFO, MR. WAS REALLY NOT SURE WHAT TO DO THOUGHTS RAN RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS MIND. PERHAPSH DUE TO FEAR, HE FAILED TO CHECK WITH THE ONLY OTHER POSSIBLE KNOWN WITNESS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING. AS HE RELATED DURING THE INTERVIEW, HE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THESE PEOPLE IN THE NEARBY CAR MAY HAVE SEEN HIM SIGNALING THE UFO, PANICKED, AND WOULD HAVE BEATEN HIM SHOULD HE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO APPROACH THEM. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS, MR. STATED THAT IF THE 2 PERSONS IN THE NEARBY CAR HAD VIEWED THE OBJECT, THEY MUST HAVE REACTED VERY SIMILARLY TO HIMSELF.
