Dear sir: I am writing to inform you about a strange object which I saw yesterday evening at about 9:30 p.m. at Ely, Nevada. The object was very bright and seemed to be moving very rapidly across the sky. It appeared to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in size, and was elliptical in shape. The object was moving much faster than any conventional aircraft, and seemed to make no sound. It was visible for only about 10 minutes, then suddenly disappeared completely. I have never seen anything like this before, and am very puzzled by what I witnessed. I would be grateful if you could provide me with any information or explanation for this sighting. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
