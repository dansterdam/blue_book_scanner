"That night about 8:30 PM, August 9, 1965 a rather strange incident occurred. I was sitting at home watching TV when I heard a loud noise outside which sounded like a low flying jet. I went to the front door to see what was causing the noise and to my amazement I saw a large round object hovering and turning in the sky. The object was quite sizable, approximately 60-70 feet in diameter and was emitting a bright bluish-white light from around its outer edge. The object seemed to be completely silent in its movements and hovered for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before speeding up and disappearing completely out of sight. I was quite amazed at what I had seen and immediately called the local police who did not seem to take the incident very seriously. I also notified the local newspaper but they did not send anyone out to investigate the incident. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this and I am not the type of person who is prone to fantasize or imagine things. I am a practical down to earth person and have never been one to get excited over UFOs or little green men. However, in this instance I can assure you that what I saw was certainly not of this world and I am convinced that I witnessed some kind of advanced aerial vehicle or craft of unknown origin. I have wracked my brain trying to figure out a rational explanation for what I saw but I can come up with no other logical explanation other than the craft was of extraterrestrial origin. I hope you will give this incident the serious consideration it deserves. Please let me know if you have any other questions."
