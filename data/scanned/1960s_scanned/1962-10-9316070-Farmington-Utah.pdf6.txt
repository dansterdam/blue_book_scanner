REPORT:
On 23 October 1962 at approximately 2300Z hours an observer was duck hunting in Farmington Bay, Utah (25 miles north of Salt Lake City). The observer observed an unidentified silvery spherical object, approximately 15 feet in diameter approaching from the west at an approximate speed of 700 knots (800 mph). The object was trailing a brilliant elongated light and appeared to be traveling at a tremendous speed and disappeared in one or two seconds. The object was visible for approximately 20 seconds.
