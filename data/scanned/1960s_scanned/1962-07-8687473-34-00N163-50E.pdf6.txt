NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
30 JULY 1962
ILLINOIS (A/W)

AFRO BULLETIN - - - - - - - -March 1962
On 13 July 1962, at approximately 1900 hours, Ronald B. Berringer, who has 3000 flying time and a commercial pilot's rating, gave this account of his sighting. He states that on 12 July 1962, he was moving at about 1600 feet above the ground at about 125 mph, near Camp Lakota in Illinois on 13 July 1962. Approximately two minutes later, he noticed a brilliant orange object traveling at a much greater speed than any helicopter was capable of doing. The object just 3 have seen some operations being performed, such as raising and lowering the landing gear, because there was a jet of flame about 3/4 the size of the object itself. The raising and lowering operations did not appear to impede the object's speed at all. The speed was so great and the object so brilliant that I could observe no details at all. It simply appeared to come from the larger object and then rejoin it again. The full moon was shining and I had ample opportunity to make a good observation. The object was estimated to be at least 1000 feet above the ground. It made no noise that could be heard from the plane. The color was a brilliant orange and the shape was not round but elongated. No sonic boom was heard at this time. The object either slowed down dramatically or stopped moving altogether when it apparently joined the larger object, which then appeared to hover motionless. The motion and appearance was unlike anything I have ever seen operated.
