Specify the visible source of illumination present during the sighting, such as the Sun, headlights or nearby lights. Is the object self-luminous? How does its brightness compare with the identified source of illumination?

It appeared to be a steady light or star. At first observed at about 15 degrees above the horizon and to the southwest. It appeared to move slowly at first, then rapidly up and to the left, disappearing within a few seconds. No other lights or objects were seen, and no sound was heard. The object did not appear to have any definite shape; it appeared simply as a steady light or star. It did not seem to flash or pulsate, nor did it change color or intensity of brightness.
