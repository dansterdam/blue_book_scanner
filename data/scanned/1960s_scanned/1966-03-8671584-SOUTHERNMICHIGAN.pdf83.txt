Pentagon to Get Aid Plan
The U.S. Air Force 4-c., Hillidale, Michigan, has 
requested the assistance of the Department of Defense to help.
Such moves resulted from a sighting of a flying ob- ject seen in southern Michigan. It describes the events as follows:
On 8 March 1966, a sighting was made at about 2130 hours in the vicinity of Hillsdale, Michigan, which lasted for about 30 minutes. The object was described as rectangular in shape, about 60 feet long, 15-20 feet wide and 8-10 feet thick. It had a dull grey color. At times it appeared to be hovering and at other times it moved slowly through the sky at an estimated 40-50 mph. Several persons saw the object, including farmers, police and deputies. The object was tracked by the local police and deputies for some time in an attempt to identify it.
Lt. Allen Hynek of the Astronomical department of Northwestern University has been contacted for assistance in analyzing the sighting.
It is requested that the Department of Defense assist in the identification and analysis of this object sighted in southern Michigan. Any information that may be available on this incident would be appreciated.
