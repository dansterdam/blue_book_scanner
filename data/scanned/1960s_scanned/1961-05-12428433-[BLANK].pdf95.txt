PROJECT MERCURY
Little Joe
The Little Joe launch vehicle was used primarily during the research and development phases of Project Mercury. Little Joe, which was developed especially for Project Mercury, is a stabilized launch vehicle which has in-built facilities and controls to provide the abort capability in case of launch vehicle failure. The launch thrust is 1.4-million pounds.
Prelaunch preparations at Wallops Island for a Little Joe launch is shown in figure 9. To date, the following Little Joe tests have been performed:
(1) Little Joe 1, October 4, 1959. - A first Little Joe vehicle was floicn, primarily to check out the booster and launch performance. This flight proved the stability and integrity of the design system at maximum range.
(2) Little Joe 2, November 4, 1959. - The primary objective of this flight was to check the operation of the escape system for the command launch vehicle. All the capsule functions occurred as programmed and the capsule landed impact free. Analysis showed that the capsule was sufficiently stable to permit safe abort in case of booster failure.
(3) Little Joe 7, January 21, 1960. - This was a repeat of the Little Joe 1 flight to check out maximum dynamic pressure. All test objectives were successfully achieved; the cabin was recovered with minimum damage.
This flight was to have checked the operation of the capsule escape system at maximum dynamic loading. The capsule for this flight was previously subjected to an acoustical vibration system at maximum levels expected in flight and showed that the capsule was sufficiently stable to permit safe abort from the booster. Due to malfunctioning valves which caused a delay, the capsule clamp ring did not release and the capsule failed to separate from the booster.
