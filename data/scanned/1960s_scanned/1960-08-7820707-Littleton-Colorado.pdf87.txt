Analysis and Conclusions: The object was in view for 30 to 30 minutes with very little apparent or no motion, which appeared to be low altitude. The object gave off a blue-green light or color at times, which occasionally flashed, and remained stationary most of the time. The object appeared to get closer at one point, giving the impression it may have been a large balloon. However, the lack of detailed description and the lack of movement make it difficult to confirm this possibility. Another possibility is that it was a satellite in orbit. There is insufficient information to determine the exact nature of the observed object.
