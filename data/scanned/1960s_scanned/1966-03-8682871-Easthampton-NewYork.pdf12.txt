Request for Additional Information on UFO Sightings
22d fighter wing 
JUL 21 1966
Reference the unidentified observations of 29 March and 7 April 1966. This information is not sufficiently for evaluation, and was quite confusing. Request you clarify the following:
1. Were there eleven observers to the 29 March sighting or to the 7 April sighting?
2. Mailing addresses were not provided for the eleven witnesses. These are necessary so that we may reach them to get further information on their observations.
3. Complete weather data is needed for both the 29 March and 7 April sightings.
