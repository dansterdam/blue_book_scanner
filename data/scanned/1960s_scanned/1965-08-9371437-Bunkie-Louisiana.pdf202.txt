Transcribed text from the document:

"LT. NORMILLE, USAF, COLUMBUS, OHIO - 6 Aug 55
They are preparing a program, wanted permission to have Major Quintanilla to talk to SAFOI and that the Colonel's program because they were having a current "flap". They had had the program prepared for quite some time and now all of a sudden the Pentagon up and says no. He was quite upset and Major Quintanilla was to be on the program. Major said he was not in the public relations aspect and he would have to do what SAFOI directed him to do. She then suggested Dr Byiek be on the program. She had talked to him and he said he would be in Denver during August 1955 and could be on them. It would be up to Major Quintanilla. Major said he would see what SAFOI had to say. Any statement must come from them, any authority for radio and television appearances etc. She said she don't know just what SAFOI's policy was on the program. Your program is going to be on the 25th of August, said she would come to Denver, or we could come to Columbus.

Major Quintanilla was informed on 5 Aug 55 that neither he nor Byiek could be on the program. Col Quintanilla informed Miss Northrop of SAFOI's decision.

CAPT DOUGLAS UNION INFORMATION OFFICER, EGLIN - We have a rush of people wanting flying saucer things in the magazine. One wants to talk to the press and given them a statement. 90% of the cases are blinding lights. Told them that any press release must come from SAFOI. If you can identify the cases there is no need to forward them. However if identification is not made do forward them. Was very insistent upon wanting a statement to get the press off their backs. Once again informed that a SAFOI statement would have to come from them."
