Gentlemen:

In a recent newspaper article, I read where to write to you about U.F.O. sightings. By sightings we several months ago, and I had forgotten about it until I started reading recent reports on this.

My report goes as follows:

On the night of January 10, 1965, a Friday, I went to Beckley, West Virginia, to spend the weekend at our campsite along with my father. That night, I went to the city of Lewisburg about 22 miles from our camp.

It was about 11:00 P.M. and I was traveling in a northeast direction around Lewisburg. The Lewisburg the city of Lewisburg and Clintonville. About 1 mile out of Ronceverte, I crossed a large hill which seemed to be the main valley which I then valley which is surrounded on all sides by orange trees.

When I looked off to my left, I could see Lake Wiggins. It was many times bigger than the base of the hill where the valley meets the lake. There was a disk of a silvery color. It appeared to be driven at an altitude of 50 to 60 feet, hovering about 50 feet off the ground. I observed the same area and there was no object which has appeared before.

I know that this is a long time afterwards to report my sight, but if you could help solve my mystery, I would deeply appreciate it.

Thanking you in advance.
