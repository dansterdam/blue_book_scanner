TEST/UFO (MAJ H QUINTANILLA, JR/TO916/MHA) 19 MAY 1967
UFO OBSERVATION, 4 AUG 66
Detroit, Michigan 48234
1. Reference your recent correspondence requesting the Air Force evaluation of your 4 August 1966 observation. Detailed investigative studies did not provide identification; however, no substantive evidence of an abnormal aerial object was obtained. The description of your observation is similar to that description of other reported sightings. These sightings are normally destroyed after thirty days, thus preventing actual substantiation or accurate data being retained.
2. There were no additional reports from your area at the time of your sighting. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

JAMES C. MAUATT, Colonel, USAF
Director of Technology and Subsystems
