PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 12 Jan 61
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1900 CST
6. DURATION OF OBSERVATION: 1-2 min
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Witness observed a large brighter than star object with a lot of close, fixed away to the east, remaining stationary for a while on West, then moving N and disappeared. No sound was heard. The object appeared as large as man's hand at arm's length, brightening and fading at intervals.
11. COMMENTS: The object, seen at all probability, was star-like of unusual brightness, momentarily intensifying and moving slightly back and forth but remaining on station for several minutes. No evidence that would indicate this was anything other than a star-like phenomenon, possibly a planet or a bright star affected by atmospheric conditions.
