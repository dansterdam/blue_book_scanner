1. Reference your letter, TDEW, UFO Radar Returns, 6 Aug 65, Louisville, KY & Chicago, ILL, dated 14 September 1965.

2. The position position given of the objects (approximately 30 miles to the south of Chicago) have read 3940N, 8700W. The two radar sites concerned did not make positional identifications under contact. Rather, the objects seemed to appear and disappear sporadically.

3. Objects were observed by both radar sites during the same time period; however, further investigation showed that the sites were not detecting the same objects.

4. There were no known temperature inversions in the area at the time of the detections.
