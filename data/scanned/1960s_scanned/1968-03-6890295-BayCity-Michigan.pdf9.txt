There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. 

Based on the OCR, the text in the document is as follows:

"DID YOU OBTAIN ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OR MOTION PICTURES OF THE PHENOMENON? ( ) YES ( ) NO. IF YES, DESCRIBE.
" (THESE MAY BE RETURNED TO YOU IF SO DESIRED."
"IN ORDER THAT MY ESTIMATE OF THE PHENOMENON MAY BE BASED ON COMPLETE INFORMATION, PLEASE GIVE ANY OTHER DETAILS WHICH YOU CAN RECALL REGARDING THE PHENOMENON. PLEASE MAKE A ROUGH SKETCH ON THE REVERSE SIDE OF THIS QUESTIONNAIRE SHOWING THE OBSERVED POSITION OF THE PHENOMENA IN THE SKY, AND DESCRIBE THE MOTION, IF ANY, OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME. ALSO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU BELIEVE TO BE THE CAUSES OR NATURE OF THE PHENOMENA, AND DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WHAT YOU ACTUALLY SAW AND WHAT YOU INFER OR CONJECTURE."
"I confided to a friend, who also observed, the edges were more luminous, it had a central bulge"
