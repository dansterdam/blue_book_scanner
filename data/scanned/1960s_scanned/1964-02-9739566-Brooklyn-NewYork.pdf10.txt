The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page shows the header "DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE" and the address "WASHINGTON 25, D.C." along with what appears to be a postmark or stamp from "5 MAR 196" and the location "BROOKLYN N.Y.".
