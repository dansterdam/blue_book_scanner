This page from the Project Blue Book file does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a questionnaire or report form with a handwritten response in the space provided.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: [Blank]
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The handwritten response states:
"The fight may center on noise & the sighting appear to be somewhat insignificant, but the significance of their actions is important, for they had no visual object to confirm their chase. This is the type of incident that needs to be taken seriously, for it may mean nothing, or it may mean a great deal - with no physical evidence."
