THE HUBBARD, OREGON, LANDING: On May 18th, a 10-year-old farm boy reported that at 10:30 p.m., a shiny silvery object with four prongs settled on his parents' farm when he noticed it. The UFO was sitting in a wheat field, not more than 200 feet from him. It was about the size of a kitchen table, and five feet high. As he watched, unable to move, the object began to make a beeping sound. When it reached telephone pole height, the UFO suddenly "seemed to lift like a rocket" and disappeared. The boy then ran home and told his mother.  
While waiting for the sheriff to arrive, Mrs. Hubbard and a neighbor decided to take a look at the field. What they saw was an almost perfect circle about three feet in diameter where the wheat had been flattened. Outlines of the circle showed three "prongs" marks, though the sheriff said there were four. The neighbor who was with Mrs. Hubbard was notified of the incident, and about how the strange marks were discovered. The sheriff's deputy arrived later and saw the same marks, and still later a team of Air Force officers came to investigate and take pictures. It was obvious to all that the object had really shaken up the incident, and the deputy sheriff remarked: "That they either saw something or had hallucinations."
