The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document:

PHOTO NOT AVAILABLE - COPOGC REPORT
R.D. Fusselman, 613 4th Street, Bryte, California.
Dear Sir:

The object reported by you on 6 June 1965 has been investigated by this office and the report is as follows:

Your report of an unidentified object in the sky over Bryte, California at approximately 10:00 PM on 6 June 1965 has been carefully examined. The description you provided indicates that the object was probably a meteor or space debris re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The reported flashing lights, rapid motion, and apparent size of the object are all consistent with a meteor or piece of space junk burning up during entry into the atmosphere. 

While we cannot rule out the possibility of an unconventional aircraft, the preponderance of evidence suggests this was a natural phenomenon rather than an artificial or extraterrestrial craft. Our investigation did not uncover any additional sightings or reports from other witnesses that would support the presence of an unidentified flying object.

I trust this provides an adequate explanation for the incident you observed. Please feel free to report any future sightings to this office for investigation. We appreciate your cooperation and interest in this matter.

Sincerely,
(Signature)
