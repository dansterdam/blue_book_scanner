18 January 1961

Dear Mrs [REDACTED],

Your letter of 11 January 1961 has been forwarded to me. An investigation of the alleged observation of an unidentified object on the night of 7 January 1961, in the Bothell, Washington area, has been conducted. There was insufficient evidence to confirm the existence of any unusual aerial phenomena that night.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
