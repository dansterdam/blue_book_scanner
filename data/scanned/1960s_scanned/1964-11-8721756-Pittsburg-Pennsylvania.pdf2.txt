Dear Sir: I am a Yellow Taxicab Driver in Pittsburgh,Penna. While driving this shift, I spend some time each day at Greater Pittsburgh Airport. I keep looking for something unusual, and to my dismay, they have nothing to report that seems to be falling stars, lately. 

I seem to have seen small lights lazily and remarkably fall onto the Airport.And after a very close one fell several months ago, a Mr. Johnson,here,called me to the roof of the Sheraton Hotel,and we both saw the downtown lights of the Pittsburgh Airport.

Mt. johnson,whose telephone number is (deleted) said the downtown lights never shine so brightly and it was standing outside of the taxicab,looking up onto the sky, as I was, and it came into my vision, falling straight down, and turning around in a semi-circle and then died out.

Hoping you have some idea, this may add something to.

Sincerely,
(Signature)
