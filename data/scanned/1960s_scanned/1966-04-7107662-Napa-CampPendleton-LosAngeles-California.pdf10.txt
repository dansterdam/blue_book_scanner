The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report describing an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

AT 2300 LOOK TUDEE FLASHED DOWN IN UNIT (2-4) AND INFORMED ME OF A UFO IN THE ARIA. I OBSERVED A GLOWING GREEN LIGHT SHAPED LIKE A HORSESHOE, WHICH WAS OVER LAKE O' NEAS. I RADIO'D IN THAT THERE WAS A REPORT OF A UFO AND THAT I COULD OBSERVE SAME.
I WAS TOLD TO KEEP SAME IN VIEW AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. I OBSERVED THE GLOWING GREEN "CLOUD" FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BUT WHEN THE SUN BEGAN TO RISE THE CLOUDING CLOUD DISAPPEARED.
THERE WAS NO NOISE AND THE OBJECT CHANGED SHAPES FROM A "HORSESHOE" SHAPE TO A "TEARDROP" SHAPE. AS THE SUN CAME UP THE OBJECT FADED AND DRIFTED OUT TOWARD THE OCEAN.
