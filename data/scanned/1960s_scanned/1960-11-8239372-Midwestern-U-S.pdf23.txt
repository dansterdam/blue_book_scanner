PILOT AND COPILOT STATED THAT THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FLIGHTS. APPROXIMATELY 1015 HOURS WHILE CRUISING AT APPROXIMATELY 7000 FEET OVER THE MIDWESTERN U.S., THE FOLLOWING OBSERVED:

A BRIGHT LIGHT APPEARED ABOUT 10 MILES DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE AIRCRAFT AT A LOWER ALTITUDE. IT SEEMED LARGER THAN A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT AND VERY BRIGHT. IT APPEARED AND THEN VANISHED QUICKLY. WHEN FIRST SIGHTED IT WAS ABOUT 1 O'CLOCK THE PLANE'S NOSE AND SEEMED TO BE MOVING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. IT FADED OUT SO RAPIDLY, THE PILOTS COULD NOT DETERMINE ITS EXACT MANNER OF DISAPPEARANCE. IT APPEARED TO BE MUCH LARGER THAN A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ERRATIC, MAKING SHARP TURNS AND RAPIDLY CHANGING ALTITUDES. THE PILOTS STATED THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY UNLIKE ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT THEY HAVE EVER SEEN.
