This image appears to be a sketch or drawing of a large, elongated UFO object. The object is depicted as a dark, blurry shape against a white background, with some text at the top indicating it is a "40.50 FT THIN CENTER" object. The text at the bottom states "As seen at approx. 500' distance" and "He said it had a glow which gave it's shape." There does not appear to be any photographic image present in this document.
