Dear Sir,
I wanted to tell you about the object I saw the other night. It was around 9:30 p.m. on February 22, 1964. I was driving home from work and as I approached the Rivesville, West Virginia area, I noticed a bright light in the sky. At first I thought it was a star, but as I got closer, I could see it was much larger and brighter than any star.

The object was hovering very still in the air and it appeared to be circular in shape. I would estimate it to be about 200 to 300 feet in diameter. The light it was emitting was a brilliant white, almost like a welding torch. I did not see any wings, tail or any other appendages. As I continued to observe it, the object suddenly accelerated at an incredible speed and disappeared from sight within a few seconds.

I was very shaken by what I had just witnessed and I immediately reported it to the local authorities. I hope this information is of some use to your investigation. Please let me know if you need any additional details.

Sincerely yours,
