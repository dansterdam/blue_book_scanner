OFFICIAL HALLET STATION REPORT

HAL MCCORKLE - SCIENTIST

HAD WITNESSED THIS U.F.O. WITH STATION COMMANDER PHIL MOORE AT 0215 HOURS ON 6 JUNE 1962 WHILE ON ROUTINE PATROL APPROXIMATELY 3 MILES FROM STATION. OBJECT APPROACHED STATION FROM EAST AT HIGH SPEED, SLOWED TO ABOUT 100 KNOTS, THEN HOVERED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES. IT WAS ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE, APPEARED TO BE SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER, AND HAD A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT EMANATING FROM LOWER PORTION. AFTER HOVERING, IT ACCELERATED TO TREMENDOUS SPEED AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE HORIZON TO THE WEST.

COMMANDER MOORE AND I BOTH OBSERVED THIS OBJECT WITH MANY OTHER PERSONNEL WHO WERE SUMMONED TO OBSERVE IT AS WELL. THIS WAS A HIGHLY UNUSUAL SIGHTING THAT CANNOT BE EXPLAINED USING CONVENTIONAL MEANS. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR SOME TIME THROUGH BINOCULARS AND WAS NEVER IDENTIFIED AS ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. THE MANNER IN WHICH IT OPERATED IS COMPLETELY FOREIGN TO ANYTHING IN OUR CURRENT INVENTORY OF AEROSPACE VEHICLES.

STRONGLY RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY RELEVANT AUTHORITIES. THIS IS A MATTER OF GRAVE NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERN.
