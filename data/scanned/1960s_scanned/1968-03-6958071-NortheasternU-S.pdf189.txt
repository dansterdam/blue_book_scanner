The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from the University of Pennsylvania Flower and Cook Observatory, addressed to Colonel Quintanilla. The letter discusses recalculating the orbit of an object observed on March 3, 1968, providing the radiant corrected, parabolic orbit parameters, and regretting the necessity of asking for the corrections to be made.

UNIVERSITY of PENNSYLVANIA
PHILADELPHIA 19104

Flower and Cook Observatory 

Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

Following my last letter of a few 
days ago, I have recomputed the orbit of the March 3,1968, object, putting in the curve-ture correction with the proper sign. Fortunately it does not change the text in any respect nor the sidereal path, only the last 6 digits need change with data on the orbit. I will now put the figures in as they should be:

Radiant corrected           a 52" h -7"
                           R.A. 58" Decl. - 32"

Parabolic orbit:  Inclination      18"
Long-Ascending node       164"  
Long. Perihelion          327" 
Perihelion distance       0.93 A.U.

I regret the necessity of having 
to ask that you make the corrections, but fortunately they are at the very end.

Sincerely yours,
Narberth, Pa. 19072.
