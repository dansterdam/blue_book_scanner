The following is a detailed report compiled from information obtained by a CBS news team in Hernando, Florida on 1/20/67. The information was given to me by a member of the CBS team.

On the evening of 1/20/67 at approx. 11:30 PM, a number of residents of Hernando, Florida observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky. The UFO was described as being elliptical in shape with a diameter of 50-60 ft. It was reported to have been orange in color and to have pulsed or flashed at irregular intervals. The object was said to have hovered silently over a nearby pine forest for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight.

Several witnesses said they were awakened from sleep by a bright light shining into their homes. When they looked outside, they saw the large orange object hovering over the trees. One witness, a 'Mrs. C.', said the UFO was only about 200 yards from her home and that it made no sound as it hovered. Another witness, a 'Mr. N.', said he was driving on the highway when he noticed the object and that it accelerated at a fantastic speed when it left the area.
