THE RECORDS SHOW THAT THE WHITE LIGHT WAS FIRST SEEN APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES EAST OF CHOSHI JAPAN AT ABOUT 2820H WHEN FLIGHT CONTROLLER AT AIR DEFENSE CONTROL CENTER RECEIVED A REPORT THAT AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN WAS BEING TRACKED ON RADAR MAKING A VERY RAPID ASCENT TO AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 50,000 FEET. CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL IN THE AREA AT THE TIME CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF THE EXTREMELY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT. SUBSEQUENTLY THE LIGHT MADE A 90 DEGREE TURN TO THE WEST AND THEN DESCENDED RAPIDLY TO ABOUT 40,000 FEET WHERE IT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. THE LIGHT THEN RESUMED A WESTERLY COURSE AND ACCELERATED TO AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF ABOUT 3000 TO 4000 KNOTS BEFORE DISAPPEARING FROM RADAR. RADAR OPERATORS ESTIMATED THE LIGHT COVERED A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 200 MILES IN APPROXIMATELY 2 TO 3 MINUTES. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY RAPID RATE OF SPEED WHICH CANNOT BE RECONCILED WITH ANY KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT. THERE WAS NO EXHAUST TRAIL OR SONIC BOOM NOTED DURING THIS OBSERVATION. RADAR OPERATORS WHO TRACKED THIS LIGHT WERE HIGHLY EXPERIENCED AND RELIABLE INDIVIDUALS WHO CONFIRMED THIS UNUSUAL OBSERVATION.

PAGE FOUR REFERS TO THE SIGHTING AS INCREDIBLE AND ATTRIBUTES IT TO SOME SORT OF RECONNAISSANCE VEHICLE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN. IT STATES THAT NO KNOWN TECHNOLOGY OF THE TIME COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE EXTREME SPEED AND MANEUVERABILITY EXHIBITED BY THE OBJECT. THE DOCUMENT CONCLUDES BY STATING THAT THIS SIGHTING MUST BE CONSIDERED A VERY RELIABLE REPORT TO THE CLOSEST SIGHTED.
