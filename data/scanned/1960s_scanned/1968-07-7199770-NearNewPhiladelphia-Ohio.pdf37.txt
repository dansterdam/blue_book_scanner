U.F.O. SIGHTINGS 
DAYTON, OHIO
DEAR SIR: 

I AM ENCLOSING THIS LETTER TO INFORM 
YOU OF MY SIGHTINGS OF A U.F.O. WHICH 
OCCURRED SOUTH EAST BETWEEN 8:40 P.M.
AND 9:05 P.M. ON JULY 2 1968.

I WAS STANDING OUTSIDE MY HOUSE WHEN 
I FIRST NOTICED THE OBJECT. IT WAS
BRILLIANT WHITE IN COLOR AND TRIANGULAR
IN SHAPE. IT HOVERED SILENTLY FOR SEVERAL
MINUTES THEN SHOT OFF AT A HIGH RATE OF 
SPEED TO THE SOUTH EAST AND DISAPPEARED. 

IT APPEARED AGAIN A FEW MINUTES LATER
AND REPEATED THE SAME MANEUVER. THIS
OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES OVER A PERIOD
OF APPROXIMATELY 25 MINUTES. THERE
WAS NO SOUND EMITTED FROM THE OBJECT
AT ANY TIME. 

I AM A FORMER SCHOOL TEACHER AND HAVE
NEVER HAD ANY EXPERIENCE WITH SUCH
PHENOMENON BEFORE. I WOULD APPRECIATE
ANY INFORMATION YOU COULD PROVIDE ME
ON THIS INCIDENT.

THANK YOU,
