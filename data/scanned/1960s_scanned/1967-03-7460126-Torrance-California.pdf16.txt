Four Torrance boys went out to play Saturday afternoon and saw something strange in the sky over Torrance. 
The boys - they were convinced - saw a flying saucer - but no one would believe them.
The entire affair seemed "real weird" to them, because they knew they saw something but couldn't convince anyone else. 
"It was another world - something you see on television," one boy said.
But the youngsters may have the last laugh. It turned out they photographed a kind of unidentified flying object in their little back corners.
We know we saw something, and now we have the picture to prove it," Rick Girety, 13, of 6027 Deelane St., said.
Rick photographed the object about 1:30 p.m. near Carl St. and 126th Ave. He was with his brother Dan, 14, and two friends Bob, 15, and Al Howard, 13, both of 6249 Deelane St.
"We went to my house and told my parents, but they just said, 'Don't be silly, it was just a hockey puck,'" Rick said.
"But then we went over to another friend's house. We called everyone in the neighborhood to tell everyone, but no one would listen," Bob said.
"We went to my house and they just laughed at us. But we could see the object," Rick said.
Then the boys came to the Daily Breeze to reveal their exploits. After they received the above print of their picture, they called home again.
