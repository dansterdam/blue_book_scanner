The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force project that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document is as follows:

This is in reply to your letter regarding unidentified flying objects.

A search of our case files indicates that the Air Force received only one UFO report from Minnesota for the period 2-10 August 1962. This report came from Proctor, Minnesota, and was evaluated as unidentified.

I am enclosing a copy of the Air Force evaluation of the aerial case which you requested.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. SPAULDING
