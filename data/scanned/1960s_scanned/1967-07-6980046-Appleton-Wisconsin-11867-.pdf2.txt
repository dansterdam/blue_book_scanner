The witness, a radio engineer, reported observing a bright metallic, cigar-shaped object at an elevation of about 60 degrees above the horizon. The object was observed for about 3-5 minutes. No sound was heard.

The witness stated that he used to work with radar and said that the radar-like pattern observed in the sky was "identical to those obtained with radar-type signals." He further stated that the pattern was "identical to those obtained in the laboratory with radar-type equipment."

The witness stated that the object was of a metallic silvery color, without wings or tail, and maintained a steady position in the sky. The object was estimated to be about 50-75 feet in length and approximately 30 feet in width.

The report concludes that the object was possibly a radar reflection or some type of unidentified aerial phenomenon.
