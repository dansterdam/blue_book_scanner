The text in the document reads as follows:

"The witness thought she heard a sound, but couldn't make out what she heard. The sound was described as a rumble. We notified the Air Force within the same day, and the object may have flown through its radar. No pictures could be taken. The light was red and appeared to be quite large, and appeared to be some distance away. The object seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed. The witness could not determine anything else that might indicate what she saw, as she was scared and nervous. Efforts to analyze or interview the witness further have been unsuccessful."
