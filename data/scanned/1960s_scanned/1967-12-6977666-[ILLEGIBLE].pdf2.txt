The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The text describes the observer's account of a UFO sighting, including details such as the UFO moving toward the observer, disappearing behind a church steeple, and coming out the other side moving faster. The sketch includes some labels or symbols, such as "Orion", "Foot", and "Tree", but it does not clearly depict any recognizable objects or scenes.

Now acting as an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

we were observing orion, sitting
the U.F.O. moving toward us, it then
Disappeared behind a Church Steeple.
Coming out the other side, still
moving toward us, then it stopped
very fast. Degree then an speed
diminished, toward us. then it disappeared
