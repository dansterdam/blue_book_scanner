Dear Sir:

I am contacting the Air Force in regards to the incident. At 9:30 pm May 9, 1965 I observed an object traveling in a northerly direction along the eastern horizon at an altitude from 4000 ft. to 6500 ft. The object was visible for about 90 seconds before sight, being obscured part of the time while moving through a stratus cloud formation. I tracked it visually with binoculars.

It was a clear night with the exception of sparse clouds. It was calm at this time, not even a slight breeze. The object made no audible sound and about the brightness of a star.

I contacted the FAA today about this. They said scheduled flights in that area at that time. The FAA said the Air Force has been monitoring with some type of aircraft used in the tail section of some jet aircraft and said it may have been what I was viewing.

If possible I would like some information on this "laser" type incident.
I am generally familiar with scientific type laser. This has to do with the amplification of light beams with radiation. I do not know if this is what the FAA was referring to however. I would appreciate any information you can give me concerning the above described incident.

Thank you.
