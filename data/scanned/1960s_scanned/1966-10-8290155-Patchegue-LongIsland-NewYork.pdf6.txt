There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a typed document from the Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University dated October 27, 1966. The document discusses a sighting of the star Sirius on Long Island, New York on October 26, 1966. It was reported by a detective and describes the object as appearing very much like Sirius, but that it was probably the object seen rather than Sirius itself. The document is signed by J. Allen Hynek.

27 October 1966

I spoke with Detective *** of the 5th Precinct on 26 October relative to the publicized Long Island sighting. From his general description and position in the sky it appears that this might have been an illusion in getting up at 2 a.m. the following morning and locate Sirius and compare the star with the reported sighting. He did so, calling back on 27 October to report that the star Sirius was just about in the same place and looked very much like the object which he reported. He concluded that probably the object and seen Sirius but he couldn't be positively sure but it was probably what he saw.

In my own mind this clinches the matter but because of adverse publicity in the past it would be wise to withhold release until we have had a chance to examine the reported photographs.
