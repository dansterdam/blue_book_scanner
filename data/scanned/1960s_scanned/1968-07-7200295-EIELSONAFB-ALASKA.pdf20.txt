The image contains two sketches or drawings. The first sketch shows an oval shape with some text below it. The second sketch shows another oval shape with a smaller circular shape inside it. There does not appear to be a photograph in this particular page.

TO: WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE OBJECT AS SEEN BY ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A PERSON WITH NORMAL VISION? THE PERSON WAS ABLE TO COMPARE THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE OBJECT TO THE SIZE OF A PENNY HELD AT ARMS LENGTH.
