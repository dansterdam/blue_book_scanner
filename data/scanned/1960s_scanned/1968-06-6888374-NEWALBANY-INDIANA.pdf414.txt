The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a compass rose diagram and two sketches. The compass rose diagram appears to be used to indicate the direction of a UFO sighting, with 16 cardinal directions labeled. The two sketches below the compass rose show a person standing in a landscape, likely representing the perspective and movement of the observed UFO phenomenon.

"IF AND IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A AZS AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON, PLACE A MARK ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON FROM OBSERVER POSITION. THEN DRAW A LINE FROM THIS MARK TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON."

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A AZS AT THE POSITION FROM WHICH IT WAS OBSERVED. THEN DRAW A LINE SHOWING THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN 'X' AND 'AZS': THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE SKETCH.
