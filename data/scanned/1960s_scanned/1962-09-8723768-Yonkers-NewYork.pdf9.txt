Dear Dr. Harder:
(3) Reporting in the middle of a case.
27. Your letter summarizing the various kinds of reports, and the instructions on reporting a sighting were most helpful. Thank you very much. We shall endeavor to follow them more closely in the future.

29. I am sorry to continue to bother you, but would appreciate your advice on the following:
I have just received a call from an architect in New York City who reported a strange sighting. He said it was a large, bright, metallic disc-shaped object which hovered over his apartment for several minutes at midday. He said many neighbors saw it too, and that it was quite close - perhaps 500 to 1000 feet up. I have his name and address, and would appreciate your suggestions on how to proceed with this case. ________________
