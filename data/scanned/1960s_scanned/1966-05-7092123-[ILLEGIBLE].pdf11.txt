The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketched illustration with a compass rose and instructions for describing the motion of an object or objects. The text on the page describes the sketch and provides instructions for the viewer.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction from which the object first appeared. Place a "B" on the compass to show the direction in which the object last disappeared.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show (by changes in direction) during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
