CONVERSATION WITH COLONEL HENDRICKS, YOUNGSTOWN RESERVE 13 Apr 66
We have been erroneously quoted by the AP, also have been falsely quoted. Have had no contact with the news media. In the initial release of a plane being two fast or two slow, nothing. I have attempted this morning to find out who in the organization may have had contact. Could find no one. News media had called last night and were informed that they had no information. Spoke with the writer of the Cleveland Plain Dealer (Bloomfield) who claims the Air Force planes were too fast. He doesn't know where the information came from. They are quoting the AP wire. Youngstown did not have any aircraft airborne. Major asked him if there were any other units close. Air Force Information flight in Cleveland gave him Sara's number in Washington to call so she could inform the Colonel up there and so she could squelch the news that they had e/e alert, when actually they did not.
