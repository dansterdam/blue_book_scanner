1. The enclosed unidentified substance was found by Mr. Morgan, Omaha, Nebraska, on 30 March 1967. According to Mr. Morgan, he found the particles after they had recently fallen in his backyard between 1800 and 1950 hours CST. He also placed one piece that fell on his driveway concrete. The particles were extremely light in weight, resembling ash in appearance. The bulk of the particles were found scattered in the yard and one piece that fell on his concrete driveway.

2. Mr. S. B. K. plant guard for Allied Chemical Corp., LANL, took the particles to his office and turned them over to the OPPD (Omaha Public Power District). OPPD told him that they were not from their power lines.

3. On the evening of 30 March 1967, the particles were brought to our office to order to obtain a scientific analysis.

After talking to your office, we attempted to contact Mr. Morgan for a first-hand account of the incident. He was on a job and very difficult to contact. He stated that Morgan is approximately 50 years old and very stable and cooperative. According to Scheslihhofer, he was not interested in publicity, did not object to the objects being turned over to us for analysis, but would be interested in the results of the Air Force investigation.
