The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

Text extracted from the document:

This object, though it did see come circling in the sky, appears to have been some aircraft flying at a high altitude. There is not enough detail on this object to determine the following:

1. Direction - north southeast
2. Speed - about 600 m.p.h.
3. Altitude - 10,000 feet or higher
4. Size - just about my hand
5. Time - 8:45 P.M.
6. Size - 60 feet across diameter

Sincerely...

(P.S. - What did I say? All the guys are calling me "Kightbul'ze"
the one flying equestrian)
