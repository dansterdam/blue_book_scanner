FOR: The declassifier of your letter of 13 August 64. 

SUBJECT: Unidentified aerial phenomena. 

YOUR OBSERVATIONS: Thank you very much for your letter of 13 August concerning your observations of unidentified aerial phenomena.  I appreciate your interest and hope my explanations will be helpful.

As your observations indicate, there are times when objects in the sky are not readily identifiable. However, this does not necessarily mean they are of extraterrestrial origin. There are many possibilities as to what they could be, such as conventional aircraft, natural phenomena, or man-made objects. The Air Force routinely analyzes such observations in an effort to identify the objects. If they remain unidentified after this analysis, they are filed for reference. The great majority of these observations are eventually explained as conventional or natural in origin.

I also analyzed the observers on the description you provided. While I would like to analyze the object in more detail, your description indicates it was not an extended observation and precise details are lacking. However, I will file this report with the others for reference and comparison if similar reports are received.

Thank you again for your letter and please keep your future observations. 

Sincerely,

CAPTAIN HECTOR QUINTANILLA
