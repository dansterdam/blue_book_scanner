During night of December 3 1962 sighted a slightly glowing object about the size of a small jet aircraft at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft. coming from the east. Watched it for several minutes. Object appeared to have a reddish-orange glow at the rear. It was completely silent. Object suddenly stopped and hovered motionless for a few seconds, then accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared in a westerly direction. No vapour trail was observed. There was no reflection of any kind. The sky was clear and the moon was bright. This observation was made by 3 independent witnesses. The object was also under observation by at least one other person in a different location in Charlottetown. The above report has been checked and the information appears to be reliable.
