The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document, likely a questionnaire or report, related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page includes:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 27 Jan 1968

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
