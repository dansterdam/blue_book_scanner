The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Dear Re

I am returning the slide taken by D——as you wish. According to my analysis, this photo is a genuine UFO slide. I find multiple reflections of some sort.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr.
