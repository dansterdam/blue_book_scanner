Dear [Redacted],

Reference is made to your letter of May 14, 1964 in which you enclosed a report from your instructor [Redacted] on observations of UFO's by students at the Atlantic Christian College for boys.

Our Project Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has reviewed the details submitted which indicates that the observations were very routine and normal. There were no unusual features or significant data submitted.

During this period there were a number of reports received, but the most significant of the planets and natural phenomena. Sincerely,

[Redacted]
