Sources: PSID Bulletin, Vol 2, #1... May 18, 1964 - Mr. Jim Haskior, a deputy sheriff in Montgomery County, Maryland, called the Project Bluebook office to report that while on routine patrol about 12:10 AM on May 15, 1964, he had observed a strange, glowing object in the sky. 
He described the object as a "yellow disc-shaped light", about the size of a full moon. It hovered for a few minutes, then shot straight up at a tremendous speed, almost vertically. The speed was so fast that it seemed to disappear with the blink of an eye.
According to Mr. Haskior, the object was seen by several other people in the area, and confirmation was received from an other deputy sheriff in the same county. Mr. Haskior stated that he was quite familiar with all types of aircraft, conventional and military, and this was unlike anything he had ever seen before. He was certain that it was not an aircraft, helicopter, or any known type of flying object.
Note the similarity to the sightings of Deputy Jack Haines near Sterling, Virginia, on the night of May 13, 1964. The object in both cases appeared to be about the size of the full moon, a bright yellow-orange color, almost motionless at first, then shot straight up at a tremendous speed.
