LOCATION: SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA

CONCLUSION: UNABLE TO IDENTIFY
DIARY SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The observer first saw a luminous globe, very bright, hovering in the sky. After several minutes, the object began moving at a rapid rate of speed, and then stopped and hovered again. The object was observed for a total of about 15 minutes. No details or dimensions could be determined due to the distance and the brightness of the object. The observer had never seen anything like this before. The sighting appeared to meet the criteria for an unidentified aerial phenomenon.
