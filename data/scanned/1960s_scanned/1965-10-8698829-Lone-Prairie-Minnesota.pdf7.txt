27. In the following sketch, imagine that you see all the objects shown. Place a "B" beside the object that appears to be the biggest when you first saw it. Place a "G" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, or "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
