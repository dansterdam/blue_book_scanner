Text transcription:
They, it became much smaller - moving at great speed - flying around quite fast. It went straight up in a vertical position, then went back down and had time was 10:50 P.M. When we looked the object was gone.

It appeared to be a danger - field. Could not have been a meteor - thing seemed to go along sight of view - bottom was no tail - just the field - seemed circular - not circular light - something like an object - it started to shimmer - something seemed to go out of it - a clear night - no cloud.

Went to air field. Fearing something could have been bad - thing was over - this was an important part of our work - we had been in a state of alert practically the thing for more than ten minutes, than it disappeared.

J.V.S.

P.S. The thing gave sort of a orange color.
