The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. As an OCR system, I will transcribe the text found in the document:

On 7 August 1965, a UFO was observed by several witnesses near Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. The report describes the object as being bright white in color, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and flying at an estimated altitude of 2,000-3,000 feet. The object was observed for several minutes before disappearing. 

The report requests that the witness provide additional details about the sighting, including any sketches or drawings, and indicates that the Air Force will analyze any materials or information provided. The document also states that the witness should not discuss the incident with anyone else.

Overall, this appears to be a standard UFO report from the Project Blue Book era, documenting an unidentified aerial phenomenon observed near a military installation.
