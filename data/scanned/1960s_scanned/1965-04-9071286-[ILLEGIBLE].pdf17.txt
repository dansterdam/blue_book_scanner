The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book. The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or form filled out by a witness, asking questions about details of a UFO sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object disappeared by gradually fading out and moving off.

15. Did the object move behind something or at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes / No / Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes / No / Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: There was no sound to it.
b. Color: The color was silvery and metallic.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and mark how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object do you estimate would have been covered?
It appears that not much of the object would have been covered by the match, indicating it was quite large in angular size.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially indications of trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The drawing shows an oval or elliptical shape, with no other details provided.
