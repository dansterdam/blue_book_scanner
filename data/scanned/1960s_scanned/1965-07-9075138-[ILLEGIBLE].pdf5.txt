Dear Sirs,
I am writing to you about a flying saucer report. 
It was on the night of the 22d of July, the time was 9:30. It was looking into the sky for something, but I had no luck.
Later some of my pals came out and looked with me.
We looked at the Big Dipper and saw nothing, then looked again and saw the object. It was round, disc shaped, and a yellowish tint to it.
It did not blink like an airplane so I think that was out. I am not sure if it was a balloon, doubt it.
The direction it went was do east and then it went to the north and then to the northeast where it finally disappeared.
All of this took place in a minute or two.
I am very interested in this subject, please could you send me some information on it.
Sincerely Yours
