Base Investigator - Military analysis of this incident indicates the witness saw a bright light which was observed for a few seconds. The light was described as round and disc-shaped and approximately 30 feet in diameter. As the light was observed, it appeared to be descending rapidly near the ground and hovered at a low altitude for a few seconds. The witness then lost sight of the light. No other unusual markings or characteristics were observed. The report states no sounds or stimuli other than the visual observation of this phenomenon.
