Gentlemen:
I am forty-nine years old and I am reporting something which I saw about a month ago. About nine thirty one evening I was looking up into the sky and saw something that just seemed to blow up - and it looked like a big flash and then it seemed to blow up again. And then there was no more of it. I do not know what it could have been. But I do want to report that I have seen something and I hope that you will look into it and see what my be explained.
The "U.F.O." incident was around my town and there are all interested in this. We are all wondering what may be happening. Today I say a true move on U.F.O.'s and I am wondering. They said that they do exist. I want your true opinion on that. Do they exist or do not exist.
Another thing I would like to know is if you have any data where from this come from. I heard that out but the only logical place is Mars where have a thing for Mars. If have found that more have a thing than to Mars than any other planet. So I would like all the information on U.F.O.'s as possible.

THANK YOU
