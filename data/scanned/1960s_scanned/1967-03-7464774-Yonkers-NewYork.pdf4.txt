Dear Mr. ----,

Thank you for your recent correspondence concerning your observation and subsequent film strip of an unidentified flying object (UFO). Please excuse the delay in returning your film, however, the film was sent to the photo analysts and as yet, we have not received an answer to the photo analysis.

I wish to assure you that upon completion of analysis or evaluation, we will return your film strip, along with our findings.

Thank you for your interest in our program.
