Sighting of August 16, 1966
Location: Duluth, Minnesota

Witnesses: (a brother) and two nieces from California. 

The Report: The four witnesses were driving back to the suburban location of their home, on Lakewood Road, which is oriented directly north and south. As they were sitting in back of a 1964 Buick Electra, about 5 miles north of Duluth and 1-1/2 miles south of their house, the witness saw a hazy moon-like object in the sky; the others all saw it too. The witness says he was near the top of the windshield where the one who was sitting and watching, and slightly to the left of the road. Her brother stopped the car and turned off the headlights; they rolled up the windows, being apprehensive about what was going on. 

Then a spark, a star-like object, was emitted by the moon-like object, travelling horizontally to the right; directly ahead and in line with the road it began to expand and glow brighter. At first it was light bluish. It took on the form of a "perfect rectangle" for a few seconds, and continued to expand and get brighter until it became a large circular object "with rings inside the sky". The colors were blue to green. "Like shimmering" merging and changing; the entire array appeared to be rotating clockwise at first.

At this point all the witnesses became very apprehensive; put the car in reverse and backed up at high speed for several blocks, to the house of an acquaintance. All went indoors.

The witnesses called the police, and then called their parents.
