DATE 2 August 1965
PLACE HONOLULU, HAWAII AREA
REPORT NO. 8-7464725
RECEIVED 25 AUGUST 1965
WITNESS: [redacted]
SUMMARY: 
On 2 August 1965, [redacted] observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be a considerable distance away. The object was moving rapidly in a northerly direction. It then suddenly stopped and hovered for a few seconds. The object then took off at a high rate of speed in a southerly direction, and was quickly out of sight. [redacted] states that the object was not an aircraft, helicopter, or satellite, and that it was unlike anything he had ever seen before. The object was observed for approximately 30 seconds.

CONCLUSIONS:
This sighting is classified as Unidentified. The object observed does not match the characteristics of any known aircraft, helicopter, satellite, or other conventional aerial vehicle. The rapid acceleration and high speed maneuvering of the object is characteristic of many unidentified flying object reports. Without any additional data or evidence, the origin and nature of this object cannot be determined.
