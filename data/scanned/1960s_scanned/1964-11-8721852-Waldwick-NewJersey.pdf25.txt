The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text and sketches. As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Have two persons seen what would appear to be a
shaped object gliding through the sky at a
very high rate of speed. It was seen for about 4 or 5 minutes.
The object appeared to glide effortlessly and silently over the landscape. it was
oblong in shape and had no wings, fins or other appendages. Some think the
object may have been a meteor but the description does not seem to fit this
classification. The witness stated the object seemed to
glow and was much larger than any aircraft he had ever seen. The object seemed to move at a high rate of speed yet did not seem to have the appearance or motion of a meteor or comet. The witness could not determine the exact altitude or size of the object but it seemed to be a considerable distance from the ground and of an unusually large size.
