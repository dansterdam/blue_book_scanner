The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with handwritten notes and descriptions.

The text in the document reads:

On sunday night 8/7 and at about 10:30 p.m. a bright blue light was seen that had a diameter of approximately 8 feet. The light was observed for about 15 minutes. It was about 4 or 5 feet from the ground and about 30 or 40 yards away. The color was a brilliant blue and the object appeared rounded. At one point it seemed to split into two parts and then came back together. The light then disappeared.

The estimated size of the object was about 6 feet in diameter. The duration of the sighting was approximately 15 minutes.
