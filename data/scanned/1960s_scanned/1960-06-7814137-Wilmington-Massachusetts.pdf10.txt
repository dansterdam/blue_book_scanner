3. Ceiling 3000 ft scattered variable broken with high broken
(above 20,000 ft)
4. Visibility 15 miles.
5. 6/10 to 9/10 of sky covered.
6. No thunderstorms or other unusual weather was present or forecast.
15,000 ft -43° temp. gradient. Surf. temp. -56°F. -5,000 ft 13°C, -10,000 ft 4°C, 15,000 ft -19°C, 25,000 ft -28°C, 40,000 ft -57°C.
7. No unusual meteorological, astronomical or other activity was reported
that could account for the siting.
8. a check with Major Watson, the Senior Director of the Boston Air Defense
Sector, revealed that no unusual radar tracks were observed nor were any intercepts
made at the time, date and location of the reported object.
9. Due to the location of Wilmington, Mass., which is in the greater Boston
area and 13 miles N of Boston/Maguire AFB and about 8 miles from a high density air
traffic area it would be impossible to list the aircraft in the vicinity at the time. The
random presentation of this particular area is too cluttered to make identification of a
single target extremely difficult unless the radar observer was tracking a given target
or an unusually clear and distinct target appeared. Mr. Aldrich, Director of this area
for the RAF, who had the radar tapes analyzed by his technical people, confirmed in his
personnel reference to this object, of Robert T. Burns of the National Space Surveillance Center, that the object's radar return was not as definitive as was hoped.
10. According to information received the balloons burst at 1616 EST
(2116Z) after attaining an altitude of 110,000 ft. The wind direction and velocity
at the time was such that the balloons would have reached over the vicinity of Wilmington. The object was at one time 12" in diameter due to decreased atmospheric pressure,
and easily visible with the naked eye. The balloon collapsed and descended, breaking up into smaller fragments prior to the time mean or about 35 miles at Wilmington. This rapidity is estimated.
11. My position is Strike Control Officer assigned to the 3245 ACS&W Squadron
(Experimental). I am also a rated pilot. Considering the above listed statements and information I am unable to classify the object sighted by Mr.
