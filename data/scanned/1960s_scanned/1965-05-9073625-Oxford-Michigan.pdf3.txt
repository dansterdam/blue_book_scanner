UFO Report - Oxford, Michigan, 7 May 65
launched half stage separations over the United States. Furthermore, the object was stationary, or virtually so. The son had said, only a few minutes before it was still broad daylight. The light, however, was very much brighter than a star and the boy said it did not twinkle. One finger held in an outstretched arm's length would have covered all the objects. The duration of the sighting was of the order of one minute. He had just sent his son into the house for stronger binoculars when the object began to fade and was obscured by clouds. It could be that the fading was caused by the gradual cloud cover. He said at one point: "It seemed almost cut of reality as far as I was concerned." Later: "I thought deeply about what I was seeing, as to whether or not I was misconstructing my own perceptions." When he watched through the 6 x 30 binoculars he witnessed the actual separation of a copper-colored fainter object from the bright light. Then, later, from the bright object he saw what he thought was the ejection of three smaller objects, and then a fourth which he discerned considerably further cut. Both children could not see the smaller objects with their naked eyes. The copper-colored object had the motion of tumbling - like a maple seed when it falls to the earth - except that in this case the object didn't fall. It actually seemed to go up. The bronze-colored object separated from the bright light very shortly after he first picked up the light in the binoculars.
