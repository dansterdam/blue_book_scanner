On a clear night his wife and I saw two objects moving through the sky. They appeared to be some distance apart and moving at a fast rate of speed. They were not ordinary aircraft. As we watched, they would suddenly make sharp turns and changes of direction. They would disappear and then reappear in a different part of the sky. This went on for about 10 minutes. There was no sound. The objects appeared to be round or oval in shape and were glowing a whitish-yellow color. At one point they moved over the trees and appeared to be close to the ground before suddenly shooting up into the sky at a fantastic rate of speed. When they disappeared this time, they did not reappear. Both my wife and I watched this incident with great interest. We are both convinced that what we saw were not ordinary aircraft. The maneuvers and speed of the objects were beyond the capabilities of any aircraft we are familiar with.
