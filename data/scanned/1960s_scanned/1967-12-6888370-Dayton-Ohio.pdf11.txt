14. WHAT DID YOU ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

I didn't the sky for a while and I could see what looked like of lights, not really bright, sort of fuzzy looking. It just seemed to hover and I watched it for a while and then it just sort of faded away without any rapid or definite movement. It just gradually disappeared.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

It didn't, it just faded away gradually and I couldn't see it anymore.

Q. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
