I am quite certain that what I saw was not a natural phenomena that is, some astronomical object or conventional aircraft. From the manner in which it moved, hovering slowly at times and then rapidly accelerating and disappearing from sight, I feel certain it was some type of unconventional or unconventional craft of an unknown nature. I have never seen anything like this before although I have observed many airplanes, etc., in the sky. It was unlike anything I have ever seen. 

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? Project Blue Book
