27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curve line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. Direct from position first observed to ward horizon. So erratic motion. The purpose change of speed, shock more rapid than descent of sun.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? N/A
