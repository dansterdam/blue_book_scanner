Gentlemen: As I have stated, I am not sure about the dates of these sightings as I believe the date is correct on the sighting discussed in this question. About 7:15 pm as I was returning to my home at 2218 Kintyre, as I drove into the drive, I looked up and there were three (3) objects or approximately 20 degrees about the horizon. The objects were traveling at a very fast speed in a northern formation. The two objects at the front were disc shaped and the third object was cigar shaped. The two front objects were absolutely white in color. My first impression and accent to my eyes, they made a humming sound. There appeared to be a blinking light or lights on this formation as it passed by. If these objects were any sound at all, they were approximately 200 feet altitude as I ran across the street to a neighbor's home. Both of my neighbors will not see their permission reveal what they saw as they watched these objects disappear in the northern direction. This sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds to a minute. I am quite sure this aircraft was not any aircraft which I have ever seen. This sight was a brilliantly lit object, and the objects which I saw as cigar shaped, were whirling and seemed to waver as they passed out of sight. About a week previous to this sighting, I saw what I believe to be a similar object near my place of business at Center Church. this object was located, in the northeast sky to the east of us, and seemed to change color from red to white to blue, and at times seemed to almost disappear. It was traveling pretty fast as far as Granada, Mississippi. It seemed to be quite some distance off, and I was informed by the deputy sheriff, there was no known aircraft known to be in the area at that time. It was a very bright, fluorescent color. It appeared to leave a small contrail.
