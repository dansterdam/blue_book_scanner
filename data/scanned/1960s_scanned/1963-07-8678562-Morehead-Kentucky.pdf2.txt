Gentlemen:  In making this sighting
I was strongly motivated to think of
the object as a high flying jet,
even though no sound and only one
light. Perhaps it would be easier 
if this angle were checked out
first.
I would appreciate hearing
your evaluation if it would not be
too much trouble.

Yours truly,
