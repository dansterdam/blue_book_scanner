The image appears to contain a letter from the Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Observatory addressed to Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Lt. Colonel, USAF Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office. The letter discusses the sending of four prints showing the moon at various stages of the moon, which were taken using a Polaroid camera on July 12, 1968. The letter indicates that the Polaroid camera was able to clearly image the full moon, and the project manager believes these prints may be of use in studying the moon.

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

Mr. Raymond Covington, Indiana, has asked me to confirm that his Polaroid "Swinger" 20 camera (serial no. M9 7/13/16) is capable of clearly imaging the full moon. I agreed to supply him with 4 prints of a series of photographs that his images are reality - the moon.

On the morning of 12 July 1968, Mr. Covington and I loaded his camera with a new roll of type 20 high speed Polaroid film and fixed the camera to a surveyor's tripod. Seeing only second magnitude stars visible, the tripod was leveled and the camera was pointed at the full moon.

Multiple exposures were use in prints 3 and 4 to offset for poor conditions.

I am enclosing the four prints showing the moon at various stages of its cycle. It is my opinion that these prints are capable of producing an image as dense as his 18 November 1967 "moon" print.

I trust these prints will be of some use to you in studying the moon.

Very truly yours,
[Redacted]
Project Manager
