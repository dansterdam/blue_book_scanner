MEMO for the Record: 9 March 67
Received a call from Mrs. [REDACTED], with regard to a report of a sighting of a UFO by various persons in the 983-2692 area code. After having a discussion with her, she asked to send the additional information to be recorded.
Contact with her revealed that her wife had heard a funny noise like the sound of something crunching on the radio. This sound went up and down for about 1 minute, then woke her husband at 0:00 AM. The object was described as large and white. He said that they couldn't confirm that the object was as large as it seemed on the radio. Other people could hear the sound but didn't see the object. It was asked to describe the object, and they said it was white and lights, but they weren't sure if the lights were blinking. It was asked to provide the address, but only a phone number in the 983-2692 area code was provided. He works at Station [REDACTED].
