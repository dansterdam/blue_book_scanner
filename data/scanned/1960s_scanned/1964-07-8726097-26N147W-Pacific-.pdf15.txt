Dear Sir:

Regarding: After reading your request for information on the big object over my house on the night of June 29th, I am sorry but I cannot give you any more information until they went out.

It was sitting on my front lawn at Bellair Beach, and the personnel display at Clearwater, and the newspapers said it looked like large red balloons. Over 50 people saw it. It seemed about 150 feet in diameter and just hovered there and then it just took off and it was gone in a matter of seconds.

They hovered in one spot, maybe fifty feet or more, and nine-thirty.

The second and fourth times they returned, but returning it seemed as if they were scouting the area. When they left, the light moved but the object seemed stationary.

I hope this information may be of some help to you.

Yours truly,
[Signature]
