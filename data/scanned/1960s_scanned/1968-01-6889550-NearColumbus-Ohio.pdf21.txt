There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document. It appears to be a scanned copy of a typed letter describing a UFO sighting.

Dear sirs:

It has come to my attention that although this sighting has been reported to NICAP, Dr. J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern University' Dept. of Astronomy and University of Colorado's UFO center, the case enclosed has not been 'officially reported' to Project Bluebook' at WPAFB, although it was reported to Lockbourne AFS. Please consider this 'official', because you'll undoubtedly be hearing more about it if you haven't already.

On the night of Jan. 23rd, 1968, I witnessed the story I wrote and enclose with this letter; 43 others in my area have been interviewed or contacted who saw essentially the same phenomena I did. I followed objects which were not jet-or any type of traditionally propelled vehicles, hovering above 40 minutes after 11 o'clock; deputies were watching 2 circular glowing objects hover over a landing light tower in southern Franklin County.

Two objects hovered one above another, one o'clock position, and switched places as I watched. At closest point of sighting, a " grid" of some sort was visible on nearest object. Object appeared approximately the size of a DC-3 only circular, glowing, and silent. 

Objects' borders (edges) were defined, and seemed to 'contain or hold' the glowing themselves, I'm not sure what the glowing fields designated when objects moved or not, but nearest I can explain is that when objects moved they seemed to 'gather themselves up' with light, in sort of a preparation against inertia, before moving.

Objects disappeared to the east, straight out into the sky, approx 15 degree angle, so fast it seemed to pull and hurt one's eyes, when they finally disappeared.

For credentials, if they're necessary, I'm a senior at Ohio State University.
