There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that consists of handwritten text.

According to the text:
"as we were talking the lights flipped on and off - it was the object, not the aircraft. I couldn't say what it was but it sure acted interestingly as if it was a vehicle of some kind. As we were tracking it, this other object suddenly appeared out of nowhere and headed straight at us at a fantastic speed. When it got close, it stopped dead in its tracks and hovered for several seconds, then just as suddenly as it appeared, it took off at an unbelievable rate of speed and was gone. This other object continued to maneuver in a rather erratic manner, first one way then another, apparently descending at one point until it seemed to merge with or disappear into the trees below. I called the Sheriff's office and reported the incident. Shortly thereafter Deputy Barile (he was accompanied by Sgt. Koentopp) came to the site and said we were perfectly welcome to watch the UFOs as long as we didn't interfere with law enforcement activities - there was nothing in sight and that was the end of it. When the Deputy and Sgt. left, the lights began to flicker and the object reappeared, then after a short while it too disappeared. We waited for their return but they did not come back and the conversation was terminated."
