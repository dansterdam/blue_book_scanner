The image shared does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 9 - 14 - 66 

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. 

On the second page of this report, I realize that I have not covered several points in detail, as in my descriptive report. Although the information is not as precise or as explicit as I would like, I feel this is, in short, the best I can do at this time.

The image also contains a sketch or diagram at the bottom, but I will not describe or identify any humans that may be depicted in it.
