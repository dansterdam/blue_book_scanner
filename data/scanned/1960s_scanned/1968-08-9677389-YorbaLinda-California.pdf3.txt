The image contains a handwritten document, but there does not appear to be any photograph present. The text in the document is as follows:

"Dear Sirs: 8-9-67 This shows what we thought was a UFO on 8-9-67 at about 8:39 PM. Look and shape object hovered for about 30 seconds then moved extremely fast straight up and away. There seems to be more than one light and the object was bright red in color. I watched the object carefully and at the time I was writing this report I could still see the trail of the object where it had been. But I could no longer see the object itself. This sighting occurred near my home in Yorba Linda, California. I work for the ROP field unit of the San Clemente Police Department and have been interested in UFOs for many years. That's about all I can say on this particular sighting and I hope this information is of some use to your project. Yours truly, Redacted"
