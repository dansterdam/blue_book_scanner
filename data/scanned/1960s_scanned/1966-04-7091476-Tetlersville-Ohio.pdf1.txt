The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically case 10073, which occurred on 23 April 1966 in Tetlersville, Ohio. The document provides details about the location, source, number of objects, length of observation, type of observation, and physical evidence. The brief summary and analysis section states that a "glowing white and red light" was observed, and the witness testimony is considered "conflicting" and "makes it virtually impossible to make a proper analysis."
