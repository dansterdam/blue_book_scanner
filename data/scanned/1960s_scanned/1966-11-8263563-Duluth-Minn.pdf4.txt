WAS QUESTIONNAIRE AND INTERVIEW BY TELEPHONE, WHICH WAS VERY SKETCHY. THERE WERE NO STARS VISIBLE, MOON WAS VERY BRIGHT. SIGHTING WAS AN INTENSE LIGHT, VERY BRIGHT, MUCH BRIGHTER THAN A STAR AND CHANGING COLOR RAPIDLY FROM ORANGE TO GREENISH BLUE. IT APPEARED TO BE AN INTENSE FIREBALL OR GLOWING OBJECT. IN THE INTERVIEW I GAVE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS THAT WERE NOT COVERED IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE SUCH AS SCOPE WAS 3 X, IT WAS SUBJECTIVE, SAGE PERSONNEL WERE CONTACTED, TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WAS EXTENSIVE, LIGHT WAS BROKE UP IN MOTION AND DID NOT APPEAR SOLID. YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE DID NOT COVER ADEQUATELY. ADDITIONAL DETAILS COULD BE HAD WITH A REINTERVIEW.
