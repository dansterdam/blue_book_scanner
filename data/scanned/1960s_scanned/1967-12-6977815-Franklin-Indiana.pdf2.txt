For several weeks prior to this incident I was both afraid and angered by several strange lights I had seen in the sky from my home in Franklin, Indiana. These lights would hover and maneuver in such a way that I became convinced that they were some type of aircraft. To the best of my recollection, the first time I noticed this was about the 20th of November, 1967, and I would have a sighting of these lights almost every night since then. This made me that my spouse was tripped and I did not get much sleep.

About the 29th of November 1967, the mail pick-ups at the corner had a man watch for 4 or 5 pick ups each morning at about 5:30 a.m. for about a week. Or the two men who came to sell gardening door to door told my wife and they did not know anything about the sighting?

Or the 6th of December 1967, that following me from home to the work and back for 3 days?

If these and many other things happening, caused me to be reluctant to send this report in at all.
