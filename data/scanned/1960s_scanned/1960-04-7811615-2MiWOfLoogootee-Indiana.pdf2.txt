1. It has been brought to my attention that an unidentified flying object has been sighted by a civilian employee of NAD Crane, Indiana. The details of the sighting are as follows:

2. Between 0130 and 0200 (Zulu Time) on 6 April 1960, a civilian employee of NAD Crane, Loogootee, Indiana, and a member of the local police, CG-11 (Pay No. 1067), was driving east on Highway 50, about 2 miles from the Crane entrance, when he observed an object, circular in shape, approximately 40'-50' North Latitude and 87Â°-15' West Longitude. It flew towards the Crane area, did not appear to be any known type of aircraft, passed over the highway and behind a hill to the right. The object appeared illuminated and was visible for approximately 10 to 15 seconds.

3. He further reports that the sighting occurred between dusk and dark conditions and that the object appeared to be stationary and hovered for a short time. He saw no trail or exhaust from the object.

4. The weather station located at the Fire Department on the Depot reports that the wind was from the Southwest during the period, varying from 10 to 15 knots per hour.

2. No other reports of this light have been called to my attention.
