19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically tell if it was hovering, moving, etc. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The object was circular in shape, with a bright white glow, moving at a fast speed from left to right across the sky. It disappeared behind a small cloud before reappearing, continuing its fast motion.
