The image contains a handwritten letter, but does not appear to have any photographs.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the image:

that the disk-like object had luminous points on both sides of the sphere (the hub) which varied in intensity -- the points were brighter on the right side as observed and not as bright on the left (the front portion of the object). Likewise, those same points on the rear portion of the object were brighter.

From merely considering this case, due to the property and vast appearance of any children and all the other sightings did neither discern nor resolve in our community who caused our attention due to very close of about none or gay ours (point especially to me sown the other).

Our county and City police force are in full knowledge of my reports and exhibit keen concerns due to any occurrence or sighting of this nature that may occur again, and I trust they will be on the alert to take proper action.

I name and would not want anything like the hype - just the analysis of the facts.

Very Truly yours
