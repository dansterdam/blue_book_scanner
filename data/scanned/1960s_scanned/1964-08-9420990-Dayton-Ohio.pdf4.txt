The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a filled-out questionnaire or form from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text found in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered Yes:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Shape
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length and see how much of the object's diameter it will cover. If you had compared this match head with a known object or with an object that you have seen before, what was it and how much of the object would the match head have covered?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your picture all the details you can such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show the direction the object was moving.
