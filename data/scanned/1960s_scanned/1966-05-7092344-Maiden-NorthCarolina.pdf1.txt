11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a red/green, and blue colored object travel across the sky opposite the horizon. The object was noted moving into the west and disappeared from view into three distinct sections. The first or upper section was red, while the lower half was blue and green.
Due to the late date of the report, it is being carried as insufficient data since it would be extremely difficult to determine the nature of the activity.
