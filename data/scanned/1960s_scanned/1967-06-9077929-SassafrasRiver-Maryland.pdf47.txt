The image contains a diagram that appears to be part of a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The diagram includes a sketch and a compass-like illustration, likely used for observers to indicate the relative position and movement of any observed objects. However, there is no photograph present in this particular page.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object appeared above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curved line to show how high the object appeared above the horizon when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and give an estimate of the direction that they were traveling.
