There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document containing text.

Here is the text from the document:

1. Here are some AF Form 117*. If you could get Capt Hughes and anyone else at the command post who may the (UNH?) IIF September 16 contacts one,
