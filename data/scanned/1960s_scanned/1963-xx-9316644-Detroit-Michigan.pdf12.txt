TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
I was watching certain of U.S.O. and as far as I can see they are not clouds caused by marsh gases. I can state this because they are not clouds caused by march gases. First of all, these are lit up brightly and squarely shape, not smoky like marsh gases, mainly because most have been spotted at night and the moon's glow couldn't cause such a bright glow. Not only have I seen this many times, my father, brother, cousin, and I all saw it. It looked like this:

The object was lit up brightly and it's square port holes were lit up brightly too. It was making a sound something like a "humming" sound and when it flew away, it went straight up and disappeared quickly. It was a lot larger than a satellite and when I saw them on television, it looks exactly like the U.F.O. flying over her house. Her house is in Oak Park, Michigan.

I think the television station I saw it on would give them all the data they need if they are interested. It seems even though the U.S. Air Force say those U.F.O.'s are not important, yet most people believe they are some kind of device from another planet. Also, the U.S. Air Force wouldn't give any information about such things if they are just honest with us. I know withholding information about such things is just going to cause people distrust the U.S. Government. So what do you think? I believe they are from space and I know others have seen them too, but the U.S. Government keeps denying it. Thank you for your time and for the information.
