There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document.

In regard to light conditions, it would have been night time? 
The object was sighted briefly, it practically was a full moon out tonight. 
There were no ceiling above us. Visibility was very good. We could see the object very clearly in the sky.
At the time of the sighting, would you please, describe what you saw? There is a rapid running from La Ven, west. It makes a 90 degrees left turn and head north. 
It was something very extraordinary, we were not expecting that, when we finally established on a heading of 165 degrees.
You are a regular in the Air Force? I was commissioned in August 1954. I served three years on active duty until the end of 1957.
And your civilian occupation?
I think that will be all for the purpose of the recording. Thank you very much.
