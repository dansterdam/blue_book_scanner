ROCKET EXPERIMENT TIMED
WITH TWO SATELLITE PASSES AT WALLOPS
A rocket experiment coordinated with overpasses of two satellites was launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at Wallops Island, Va., at 3:02 p.m. EDT today.
An ionosphere experiment prepared jointly by the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies, Dallas, Texas, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., was launched on a 4-stage Javelin rockets. The launch was coordinated with overpasses of the Canadian satellites, Alouette II, and the U. S. satellites.
Explorer XXXI, launched "piggyback" into polar orbit by a Thor-Agena B from the Western Test Range in California November 29, 1963. The Javelin probe was sent up between the two satellite passes.
Primary objective of the flight was to measure properties of the ionosphere--ion composition, concentration and temperature and electron concentration and temperature--and to correlate the --more--
