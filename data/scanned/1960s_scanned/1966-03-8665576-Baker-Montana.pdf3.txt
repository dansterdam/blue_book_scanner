34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 31 March 1964

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: 
Bright-light in sky about 6:00 P.M. Extremely bright light, about the size of my thumb nail at arms length. It was moving at fantastic speed to the east and suddenly just disappeared. There was no sound and no trail. The light was very bright and seemed to be about one-third the size of the full moon. It was not a meteor or any known aircraft or satellite. I have observed many aircraft and satellites in the night sky and this was quite different. The light came from the south and was high in the sky when I first observed it. It moved very rapidly across the sky and then just suddenly winked out. There was no gradual dimming or fading just a sudden disappearance. I was very impressed with the extremely high speed and the unusual behavior of the light. I could not find any rational explanation for what I saw. I reported this sighting to the local Air Force base and they indicated they had received several similar reports. Although they did not deny the reality of the sighting, they did not offer any explanation.
