The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, providing an analysis of a "total sample" that was subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis, with details on the major elements present and their relative amounts. The text describes the sample as likely being a "water material such as an iron-containing slag from a pyro-metallurgical process". The sample was also checked for surface radioactivity using a beta counter and a gamma-ray spectrometer, which showed some unusual readings about the radioactivity levels.

Analysis of a Total Sample
UNCLASSIFIED

A sample identified as a total sample, labelled and subjected to a qualitative and quantitative analysis and for radioactivity showed the following:

Major Elements Present:    Minor Elements Present (1)   Traces of Elements Present (2)
Fe                        Mg                         Ti
Al                        Zn                         Ni 
Si                        Ca                         Cu
                          Ti                         Cr
                          Ga

The analysis indicates that the sample is probably a water material such as an iron-containing slag from a pyro-metallurgical process. Also, some areas of the sample were slightly magnetic, while other areas were not attracted to a magnet.

The sample was checked for surface radioactivity with a thin-window beta counter and a gamma-ray spectrometer. Both of these methods showed that there was nothing unusual about the radioactivity count of the sample.
