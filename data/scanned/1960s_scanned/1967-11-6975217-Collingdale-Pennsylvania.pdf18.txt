- AS SHOWN IN FIG. 7 BELOW, PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A '1' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. ARROW INDICATES THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. IF APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVES OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO INDICATE THE PROBABLE PATH.
