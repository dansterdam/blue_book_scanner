THE AIRCRAFT WAS VERY LOW TO THE GROUND, APP 300 TO 500 FT. BECAUSE OF DARKNESS IT COULD NOT DETECT ANY DIMENSIONS OF THE AIRCRAFT. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A HELICOPTER, IF SO DISREGARD THIS REPORT, HOWEVER IT WAS AS LARGE AS AN AIRPLANE AND LOW AS ONLY A HELICOPTER COULD FLY.
THE AIRCRAFT WAS FLYING IN ON 57TH ST. SLOWLY 700 TOWARD WRIGHT FIELD LOOKING LIKE THIS FROM A DISTANCE.
