HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION PROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "0" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
 WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED.

(The compass rose diagram has been filled in with "X" and "0" markings to indicate the direction the phenomenon was first seen and the direction it moved.)

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEE N, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATELY THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. (THIS IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL IF THE PHENOMENON IS MOVING FROM ONE POINT TO ANOTHER, FOR EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.)

(The two photographs are as described above, showing a silhouetted person and a distant landscape.)
