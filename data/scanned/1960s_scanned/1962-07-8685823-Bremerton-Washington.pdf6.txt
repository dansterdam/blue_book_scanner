I am a seahonors at Inkrkakam High Schooi, and I am extremely interested in unidentified rying objects (UFOs). I have talked with a friend on the subject whose opinion I respect. 

I have investigated the subject through books and magazines. I know the history of unidentified flying objects and that many qualified observers have reported seeing them. I am concerned to find out more about them.

I recall reading in the Seattle Times recently that more sightings have been reported recently over Washington State, but that the Air Force has been unable to explain them. They have no known answers, although efforts have been made.

I would be extremely interested in your views or opinions as to whether these UFO's could be interplanetary vehicles.

Very truly yours,
