Transcription of the text in the document:

"Dear Major Quintanilla:

I have not as yet been able to get anything that I would consider a good photograph of what appears to be a UFO which I saw on the 7th, and 10th, of July.

The first time, I had some difficulty getting the focus on my camera, and the second time the object was moving too fast for me to get a picture, although I did try to get one.

I noticed many more flights of fighter squadrons from the Youngstown area just tonight, at about 8:30 P.M. Some of these planes appeared to be chasing something, but I could not determine whether there was any connection with the UFO I saw.

I am enclosing some possibly related material on impressions that I received - the impression that the pilot either did not see me or ignored me, and other impressions that I have received which I cannot explain.

I am deeply interested in this problem, and would appreciate any comments or suggestions that you may have regarding this incident."
