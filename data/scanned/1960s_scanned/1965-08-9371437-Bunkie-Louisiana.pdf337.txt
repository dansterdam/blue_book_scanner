Gentlemen:

I am sending you a report, correspondence and two pictures sent to Griffith Observatory for evaluation. We are not able to identify this object, so cannot help you on most of these reports on U.S.A.F. as we handle here subjects on Southern California we have available to you.

We request that you send the material and photographs back to us as the we can return them to the original owner. Any further assistance on this case will be appreciated.

Sincerely,

/s/ Horn Hall
Assistant Director
