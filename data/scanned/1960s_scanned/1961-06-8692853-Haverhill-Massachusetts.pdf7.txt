The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The document appears to be a portion of a Project Blue Book report, describing an observed unidentified object in the sky.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

SYNOPSIS:

The object was stationary in the sky and appeared solid.
It was angular-like, about 17 to 27 inches in diameter, and was about 6 to 7 feet above the ground. It was surrounded by a blue-white glow.
It was a cylinder with a dome on top and appeared to move almost vertically up and down with no noise.
It was motionless. I saw only one side of the object, which was a bright blue-white color. 
I have recalled that there must have been a low-flying aircraft in the area at the time, but I am not sure.

I gave this report to the U.S. Government but only say that it was an Unidentified Object in the sky.
