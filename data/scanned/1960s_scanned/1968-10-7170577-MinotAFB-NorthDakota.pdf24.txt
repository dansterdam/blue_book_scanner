Text extracted from the document:

There was a pretty good temperature inversion.

Col Warlich said he would send an overlay for the 500 series map chart which is used by the home people in the operating section and the people over at USAF should have the master chart.

The chart is classified so to save time, signatures, etc, Col Warlich is just sending the overlay so that we can put it over the chart that the home people have. See the B-52 Nav targeting people for the 500 series chart.

Gen Hollingsworth has been given all the information that Col Warlich obtained. Col Warlich said that Gen Hollingsworth was briefing Gen Compton and this briefing was probably going on at the same time Col Warlich was speaking with Lt Marano (this was approx 2:30, 29 Oct). Col Warlich said that you had to realize that there is only one person looking at the radar with the charts, the others didn't take missile photos at first until the pilot said why don't you take some photos. This was towards the end. They had to visually all the way down. Each object in the photos is nothing of value in this conversation. The clip changes shape, round, rectangular, etc. 

Col Warlich said he would be flying tomorrow and Monday. Col Warlich said he had done the initial investigation in accordance with the regulation and I'm at the limit of my capabilities.

Col Warlich I can send supplemental data and will if we make a request. Col Warlich said we were hoping for technical assistance.
