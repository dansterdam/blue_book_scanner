The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photograph, but rather a detailed description of an unidentified aerial object sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

The group reporting this rapid photo-graphic show the general scene of the sighting and show the details and flight characteristics described by the witness.

1. Shows a part of sky in which the object was seen from in front of the witness.

2. Shows the size and shape of the object as described by the witness.

3. Apparent distance: Appeared to be in front of distant trees. At one time seemed to be moving towards the witness at a rapid rate then stopped and remained stationary. 

4. In this and the following photographs, the object appears to have been seen at evening light conditions - technical center as shown in photo 2 would indicate the light was better on the technical center than the sky.

5. Location of second object: The object did not disappear but seemed to have landed or hovered at a distance and remained in sight.

Although I have not devoted as much time to investigating this report as I would like, I will submit this report for whatever it may be worth.
