The handwritten text in the document states:
"Last night at about 9:20 a.m. I walked out to look at the sky - was looking NW - saw a bright light about the size of your fist at arm's length. It was bluish-white in color and seemed to be hovering about 300 feet off the ground. It just hovered there for about 2 minutes, then suddenly took off straight up at a terrific rate of speed. I watched until it disappeared. I have 13 years in Project Blue Book, none scottish or the Atlantic ocean."
