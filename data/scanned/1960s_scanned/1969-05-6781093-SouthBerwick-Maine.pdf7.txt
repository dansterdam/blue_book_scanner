The image contains two photographs. The top image appears to be a compass or navigation diagram with arrows pointing in different directions and the word "house" in the center. The bottom two images appear to be rough sketches or illustrations depicting what looks like a landscape view with mountains or hills in the distance.

Text transcribed from the document:

This document is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on this page is as follows:

"An attempt has been made to establish the approximate location, flight path, and general direction of traveling of the observed object with respect to this dwelling by plotting the information received from the witness on the attached sketches. The witness has indicated the object's general flight path and direction in one sketch and has attempted to indicate the object's relative position to the dwelling, other landscape features, and horizon in the two additional sketches."
