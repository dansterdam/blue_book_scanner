UPO Report

TO:  TDEW

While Duty Officer, I received a call from Mr. NO-2 who claimed that Telephone NO 2-52-67 had informed him that the same UFO that was reported on the 30th of March 1965, he said he saw a bright object other than a star similar to what the bright object had seen. He said he saw it at about 10:15 on the 30th. I then it appears from East to West and then it disappear.
