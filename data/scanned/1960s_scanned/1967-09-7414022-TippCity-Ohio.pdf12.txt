The image shows a blank page with a handwritten note at the bottom that says "Are included (3) three 3 4/4" x 4/4" photographs." This indicates that the document should contain three photographs, each measuring approximately 3 3/4 inches by 4 3/4 inches, but no photographs are visible in the provided image.

As an OCR system, I will now output the text found in the document:

Are included (3) three 3 4/4" x 4/4" photographs.
