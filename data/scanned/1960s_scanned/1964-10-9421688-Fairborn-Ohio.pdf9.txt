The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with several questions and answers about a sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
As seen above, the sky became too bright to distinguish the object.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes. MOVED THROUGH AND BEHIND CIRRUS TYPE CLOUDS IN OTHER DIRECTION AT TIMES.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes. IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of:
THE VIEW OF THE OBJECT WAS OBSCURED BY TREES.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - NO SOUND
b. Color - WHITE LIGHT  

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or one's length in line with a known object and note how many of the object would have been in line with the match. If you had compared it to the moon, how many moons would have been in line with the object?
THE LIGHT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN COVERED BY A MATCH. AS IT WAS SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN THE MOON.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially indicate the direction of the object's movement. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
