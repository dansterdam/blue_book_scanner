Airforcetime
Hipanna, Tord, 1955-4

Dear Sir,

I would like to report a sighting that occurred on April 20, 1967.
I was a satellite going north, when I noticed a bright light to the west of me. It was about 8:10 p.m. 
I thought I saw a brighter coming from the light. It was moving very fast and in a straight line. It made a sharp turn and went toward the satellite. About five minutes after they had gone, I saw an object with a strange star, and pointed toward the satellite. It made a sharp turn and went in the opposite direction.
It was moving at tremendous speed. I did not see any fins or wings, and it seemed to be about the size of a house. I would estimate the speed at about 1000 mph. It made no noise and did not leave any trail.
I am not a professional, but I felt that I should report this incident.
Your truly,
