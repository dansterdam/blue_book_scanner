17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Quiet 
b. Color: Grey and white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object it covers. This will give us an idea of the size of the object and how far away it was at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Approximately 1/3

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially show the direction the object was moving.
