Transcription of the text in the document:

At 0930 landing 6/8/64 was a small circular white light (about 5-6 feet) with an underside or bottom part that appeared to be blue in color. This object was seen hovering or landing on the 3/4 acre alfalfa field of Mrs. A. W. Cash and her son, who were all within a few hundred yards. The object was all well lighted around its edge, no pulsations or up and down movements, just a steady light. It remained on the ground for about 3-4 minutes, then shot up rapidly at an angle of about 60 degrees to the horizontal and disappeared in a few seconds. The witness stated it was about 3 feet above the ground while hovering. No sound was heard. The landing site showed no burn marks or physical trace and no radiation was detected. The investigator could find no evidence of any hoax or hallucination. The witness appeared to be sincere and credible. This case is being filed as UNKNOWN.
