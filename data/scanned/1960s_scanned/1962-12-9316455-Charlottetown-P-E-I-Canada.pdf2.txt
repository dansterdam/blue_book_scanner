Dear Sirs:

At this time I wish to inform you of information gained from a close and personal observation of a flying object. This object was sighted on September 13, 1962 at approximately 9:30 PM. The object was observed for a period of approximately 10 to 15 minutes, as it hovered in the sky over Charlottetown, P.E.I., Canada.

The object appeared to be circular in shape, and was observed to be bright white in color. It was observed to be moving silently, and changing directions, without any apparent propulsion system. The object was observed to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter, and was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 to 3,000 feet. 

On several occasions the object was observed to suddenly increase in brightness, to the point where it became almost painful to look at. It would then dim and return to its original brightness. This fluctuation in brightness occurred on 3 or 4 occasions during the observation period.

I trust this information will be of use to your department in the ongoing investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
[Handwritten signature]
