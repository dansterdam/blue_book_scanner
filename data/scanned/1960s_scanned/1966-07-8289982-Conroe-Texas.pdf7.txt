Gentlemen:

On the night of July 7, 1966, I had the occasion with two other boys to see an unidentified flying object.

At approximately 10:00 P.M. I saw a bright light off in the distance and thought at first to be just a bright star. But as I watched it, the light became larger. I called attention to the object. We could see it clearly since we were out in the middle of Grand Lake in a canoe. We watched it and as the light got brighter, we heard a low hum. The louder it came, the brighter it became; then the light seemed to go out.

It never at any time became unbearable. This hum was not the noise of an aircraft, jet or helicopter. I know that definitely! As it started to the left of us, we could see the red lights. The lights were in a semi-circle pattern. It never stopped; the lights stayed on, not blinking, the low hum getting fainter as it traveled.
