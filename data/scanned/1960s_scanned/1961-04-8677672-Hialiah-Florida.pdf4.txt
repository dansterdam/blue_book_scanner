ATTN OF: TDEW 9 July 1963

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO:		Hq USAF SAF-01 3b (Mrs. WALSH 25 DC)

1. Reference the attached letter from _____. This is a request for information on unidentified flying objects. This is forwarded to your office for whatever action you deem necessary.

2. To date there is no evidence that the existence of vehicles under intelligent control from outer space has been conclusively established. Remaining skeptical and relying on all the evidence, we do not presume the existence of phenomena.

3. Information concerning the sighting of 28 April 1963 is very meager. In view of the observer's own opinion, however, it is possible that an aircraft was sighted.

Deputy for Technology and Subsystems
