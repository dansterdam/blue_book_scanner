11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a bright fluorescent, pulsating light in the southwestern part of the sky. The object remained stationary for the use of a telescope. The object was overhead when last viewed which was about 2 years before the initial observation. Colors noted were blue, white, and red.
The conclusion is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. Approximately four-fifths of the initial observers were astronomers and this would have been almost certainly identified during the initial sighting.
