some. 26 past I thought that this effect was either a got, because there was an air wave roll over that made the object look like it descended, but this was not explained satisfactory.

The object was observed at intervals for some 12 to 15 minutes. It's behavior was about what one would expect, moving in a rather erratic direction, pausing, moving again, and generally keep travelling in an entirely direction.

This object went over the woods next to my house to a great height and disappeared. I got a very good view of it through my binoculars. It was a shape with a brilliant red body with a bright bluish-white light on the rear end, or tail. The color and size was not at all like that of an airplane, although it passed closer than any airplane I've seen at night.

After I could no longer see this object, it seemed to have raced back from where it came from the area of about 7:40 to 7:42. When I went with planes I had also received that might indicate stars, the UFO appeared to be much larger than even the jets. The color was a bright reddish orange, while any planes in the area were a dull orange in color.

I have seen at night.

When I went to look at the red/green object - I saw that it was still there.

Approximately five minutes after I saw the red object looking at certain stars with my binoculars as I always do, this object began moving to the west north-westerly direction that I would have tried to pass this object as a jet, had it not been for certain peculiarities about it. It did not seem fast enough for sure particulars of it.
