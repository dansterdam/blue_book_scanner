The image does not contain a photograph, only a form with typed text. I will now produce the text found in the document:

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 07N52
2. LOCATION: Willsboro, New York
10. CONCLUSION: Unidentified
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers watch an oval shaped object with a bright, bluish glow. The object was heard when it came in and departed, and appeared several minutes later. The description is vague and insufficient for a positive identification.
