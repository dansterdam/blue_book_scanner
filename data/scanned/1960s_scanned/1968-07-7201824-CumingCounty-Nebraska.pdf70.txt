METEORS, PLASMAS AND UFOS

An interim report on an unusual plasma-like UFO sighted in broad daylight northwest of Omaha, Nebraska, on July 28, 1968. According to the report, the object was moving very slowly at a uniform speed and emitting an intense light. The UFO location was approximately 120 miles southeast of Omaha.

This case provides circumstantial evidence which appears to confirm a hypothesis advanced earlier by residents: de Vries, Arne-Professor at the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, some plasma UFOs might be plasmatic created under frank conditions out of the wake of meteors.
