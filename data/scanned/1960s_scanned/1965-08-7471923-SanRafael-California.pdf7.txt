Mrs. Hunt/man/SAFOICC/7282/3 Oct 63
Dear Mr. Malarhr, Florida, vid submit this file to the Air Force for anal:'sis. The file was analyzed at Harris air Force Base, Florida. The results of the analysis indicated that the film did not contain evidence of any unidentified aerial object. The film appeared to contain normal aircraft activity.
I talked with Doctor Hyner about the newspaper article you inquired about. He indicated that the newspaper story did not have any confirmed factual support. He could not have made such a statement to him. If you find out more information on this matter, we would appreciate your letting us know.
With regard to the alleged radar UFO report from the Pensacola Naval Air Station, Doctor Hyner had stated that he was on duty on a day in question and no such report cane to his attention.
I checked around and found no confirmed data about the radio show you mentioned. Any statements WEAL contains a tape would appear to be without foundation.
I am happy to be of assistance in providing you with this information.
