Dear Mr. Citron:

I am enclosing a copy of a report of the sighting of an unidentified flying object that I observed during this past summer. This was reported to Sky & Telescope. They replied later saying that they had no interest in this idea what the object might have been.

As that time I was unaware of your interest in this kind of thing as indicated in the New York Times article on December 16. I plan to get the article in Scientific American of November 1968 entitled "Article called in Soyance: Claiming on flying saucers' lest I thought the description would be interesting to you - the angular size, speeds, distances, and of course I believe this is a possible explanation for what I observed.

Incidentally the friend with whom I was observing that night sa wout of the corner of his eyes, as we were discussing this object, something moving at a much greater speed than it. This he did not see with me then. 

Sincerely yours
