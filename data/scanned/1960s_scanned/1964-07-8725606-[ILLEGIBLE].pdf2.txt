Secretary of the Air Force
23 July 1964
page two

I say the object for more than 3 seconds at any best estimate should be back. This estimate is between 1/2 and 1/3 of a second. Since there was no basis for estimating the size of the object, this estimate would be very difficult to guess accurately. I would say: 
The outline of the object continuously / I would say very slightly exceeded the range of apparent movement from 1/2 to 3/4 the diameter of a full moon.

I cannot accurately estimate or conclude anything further. As you conclude anything you would be speculating and asking my opinion on this sort of thing certainly I am not in a position to give you any sort of reliable information except to record an optical appearance observed by electro-optical systems. I incorperated, if accurate and fully considered, by other personnel who have witnessed such an experience. The report will serve some purpose, if only to corroborate reports by others witnesses.

Sincerely,
