The image does not contain any visible photograph. It appears to be a blank page from a document titled "What was the angular size, held a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a street lamp or the moon - not how much of the object is covered by the head of the match - how is the size ratio to determine what fraction of the diameter of the object?" The text at the bottom of the page indicates this is page 6 of 9 pages.

As an OCR system, I would output the following text from the document:

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HELD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON - NOT HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH - HOW IS THE SIZE RATIO TO DETERMINE WHAT FRACTION OF THE DIAMETER OF THE OBJECT?
