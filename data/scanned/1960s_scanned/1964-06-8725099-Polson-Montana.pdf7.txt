The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

"Unexplained sighting, quite definite information, but as yet not conclusively identified. Description and other details as per attached incident report.

"Friendly, this is a continuation page of the incident report covering the UFO sighting reported by Mrs. Lawrence of Polson, Montana on June 8, 1964. The details of the incident are as described in the attached report, which I am unable to reproduce here as there is no photograph or image accompanying this page. However, I have carefully transcribed the handwritten text on this page, which appears to be a continuation of the written incident report."
