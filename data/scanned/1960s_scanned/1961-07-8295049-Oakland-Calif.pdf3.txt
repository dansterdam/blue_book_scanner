July 27, 1961

Approx. 8:15 PM my husband and I observed an unusual object flying about the same size as the passenger planes who go over preparatory to landing at S.F. or Oakland but must have been much larger and at a proportionately higher altitude as it seemed to be.

The object was of an irregular shape but too far up for me to distinguish just what shape. It traveled from south to north above us. 
The most unusual feature was the lack of noise. It traveled from south to north above us.
