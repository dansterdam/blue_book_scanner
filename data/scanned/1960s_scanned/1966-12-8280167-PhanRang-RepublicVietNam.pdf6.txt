ALSO REPORTED AT CAM RANH BAY AT APPROX THE SAME TIME, BUT THOSE 
REPORTS STATE THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED THERE WAS SLOW MOVING AND
APPEARED TO BE A WEATHER BALLOON WITH A LIGHT ATTACHED. THE PHAN
RANG CONTROL TOWER AND THE CGA FACILITY HAD NO REPORTED TRAFFIC IN 
THE AREA, AND NEITHER VISUAL OR RADAR CONTACT AT THE INCIDENT TIME.
IN ADDITION, THE BASE WEATHER STATION DID NOT HAVE A WEATHER 
OBSERVATION BALLOON AIRBORNE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD - BECAUSE OF
THE APPARENT DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE PHAN RANG AND CAM RANH BAY
SIGHTINGS A CONCLUSIVE EVALUATION CANNOT BE MADE AT THIS TIME.

1. NONE.
