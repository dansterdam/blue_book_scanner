Dear Sirs,

Last week April 17th
my wife saw a falling
object out of the sky about
11,45 P.M. It glanced all
the way to the ground. 
The sight was quite unusual
across the rods to hunt
gophers and I spotted this
piece of milky matter on
the ground. The object hunting
appears in this area for the
past few days and moon
is up high.

The area was located
of last fall. Under the main
the green glow was beamed
the ground.
