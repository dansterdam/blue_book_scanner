Sometime between 6:30 and 7:00 p. m. on July 7, 1963, the Le Blanc family near Bantam, Connecticut observed several disc-shaped UFOs. These were first seen by two of Mrs. Angela Le Blanc's children as the objects floated slowly over the hills southwest of Bantam. The entire family was called to watch as the discs moved slowly from the southwest to the northeast. The estimated altitude of the discs was from 2000 to 3000 feet and the objects appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter. 
The length of the observation was longer than one minute but the exact figure was undisclosed in published reports. Police were unable to provide an explanation.
