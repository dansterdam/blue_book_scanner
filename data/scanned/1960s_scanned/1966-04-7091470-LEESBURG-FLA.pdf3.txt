Dear sir:--
On this date on Saturday 4-30-66, near sunset at around 6:30, I was enjoying my favorite pastime of seeing the sunset at the east end of our street, the end nearest the road.

On this particular evening, as I was looking at the sunset, I noticed movement in the sky to the northwest. This object seemed to be at a considerable distance and was traveling toward the east. It appeared to be round in shape and had a bright glow surrounding it. As it came closer, it seemed to slow down, then it moved erratically to the left, right, up and down. After it had been under observation for about 3 to 4 minutes, it suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

I immediately ran to the house and told my wife and son what I had seen. They came out and looked in the direction I indicated, but the object had vanished. There was no sound associated with the object. I have never seen anything like this before. I hope you will find this of interest. If you have any question, please feel free to ask.

Sincerely yours,
Patirson
