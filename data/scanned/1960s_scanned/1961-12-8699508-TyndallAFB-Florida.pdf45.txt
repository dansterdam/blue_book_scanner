2. Description of Course of Object:
a. When I (MSgt _____) first noticed the UFO at 0545 hours, 21 December 1961, Capehart Housing area, Tyndall AFB, Florida, the object seemed to be traveling from Northwest (315 degrees) to Northeast (25 degrees). I observed the object for five minutes, to assure myself that it was not an aircraft.
I called the Base Weather Station at 0555 hours and with Lt William Poe, I asked him to have the tower observe the UFO.
I called back to Lt. William Poe and he said A2C _____ had seen a bright object in the Northeast and it could have been a bright star.
When I reported to work at 0730 hours I called MSgt Miracle (Office of the Director of Operations) and found that the UFO was still under observation for the day. I went over to the Office of Information and discussed the UFO to Mr. Hank Bassham.
