Unidentified Flying Objects Puzzle Foster Play Audience
Unidentified flying objects were sighted last night by a number of people in the Okolona area and Hal E. Foster and others at the show called "The Stephen Foster Story" in Bardstown.
Several of the objects, which appeared to be lights, were seen about 8:30 p.m., shortly after the show opened, by Mr. Foster and other people. Mr. Foster said the objects were going at a "terrific speed" and were very high in the sky.
"A lot of people saw them and they don't seem to know what they are" said Mr. Foster. "They appeared to be moving very rapidly and in a peculiar fashion - very different from any known aircraft."
The objects were seen traveling at a high rate of speed, and changed direction several times, he added.
The first lights were seen going in a westerly direction. A short time later, the objects were reported moving in an easterly direction, and there were several of them this time. Then they appeared to be moving in different directions.
"There were four distinctly different objects in the group," he said. "They were unlike anything I've ever seen before."
Mr. Foster said some of the spectators saw the objects when they were looking up at the sky toward the end of the first act of the show.
"The objects made no sound," he said. "They traveled too fast to be conventional aircraft."
The objects were sighted again later during intermission, when many of the people saw them.
