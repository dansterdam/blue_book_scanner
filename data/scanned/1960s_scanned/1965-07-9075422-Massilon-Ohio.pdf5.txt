The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Mrs Hunt/man/SAF0100/72S42/10 Aug 65
AUG 10 1965

The document appears to be a letter addressed to someone, requesting them to report their observation from 4 July, as it should be attached to the standard form as fully as possible.

The letter is signed by J.E. Gillham, USAF Chief, Community Relations Division, Office of Information.

The bottom portion of the image contains a form with titles for "COORDINATED By (Office Symbol, Name, Grade, Date)", but the form is otherwise blank.
