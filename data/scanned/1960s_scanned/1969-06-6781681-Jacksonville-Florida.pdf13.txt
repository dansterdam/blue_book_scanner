Transcription of the text in the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)
"IF AN OBJECT IS NOT STATIONARY, PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN ARROW ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE OBJECT IS MOVING. IF A CHANGE IN POSITION SHOULD LATER BE SEEN, PLACE A Y AT THAT POINT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE CHANGE IN DIRECTION."

"IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE OBJECT WHEN FIRST SEEN AND A Y AT THE POSITION OF THE OBJECT WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE X AND Y WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE TAKEN. IF THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH."
