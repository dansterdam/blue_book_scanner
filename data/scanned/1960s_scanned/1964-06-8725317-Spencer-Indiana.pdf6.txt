Capt. Newton Quintensville, jr.

I continued my search for the sighted object in the manner prescribed and endeavored to do so without creating any undue public attention or interest. This, I felt, was an essential consideration, and fortunately the whole incident passed off without creating any undue public concern or notice. However, I did succeed in obtaining several reports and statements from reliable eyewitnesses who viewed the object. Their accounts, while differing somewhat in detail, are nevertheless, in substantial agreement as to the main facts involved. It is my opinion that they did actually observe some unusual aerial phenomenon, the nature of which I am unable to determine with certainty. However, I have gained the impression that it was not a conventional aircraft, and that the witnesses observed something quite out of the ordinary. While I was not able to obtain any tangible evidence such as photographs or physical specimens, I am satisfied that the witnesses did in fact see something that defies easy explanation in terms of known aerial phenomena. I am forwarding this report in the hope that it may contribute in some small way to a better understanding of the many puzzling aspects of the so-called "Unidentified Flying Objects" problem.
