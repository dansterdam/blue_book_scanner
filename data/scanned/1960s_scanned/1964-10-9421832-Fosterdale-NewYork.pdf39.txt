The witnesses. Neither had seen or heard of UFOs or weird flying objects before. They described what they witnessed as a "real UFO". It made several passes over the area, during which its lights were observed to change color and brightness. No noise was heard. It disappeared abruptly after several minutes.

The witnesses appeared to be sincere and reliable. Their reaction indicates that the sighting made a strong impression on them. Noting that they had seen a "real UFO" suggests they may have been convinced of the unusual nature of the object. The report notes that their observation and description of the object's behavior and characteristics are consistent with reports of other UFO sightings, and that this sighting may be significant.
