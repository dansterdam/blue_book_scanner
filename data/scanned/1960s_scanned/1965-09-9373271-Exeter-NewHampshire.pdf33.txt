FLYING SAUCER REVIEW EXETER, NEW HAMPSHIRE 3 SEP 65

Important New England Sighting
By Dan Lloyd

This unusual sighting occurred near Exeter, New Hampshire on the evening of September 3, 1965. The sighting was reported by several witnesses, including Patrolman Eugene Bertrand of the Exeter Police Station.

This event, which lasted for perhaps 45 minutes, was witnessed by a number of reliable persons from different locations around Exeter. Unappily it is too long for presentation here in its original form, but it is deemed advisable to publish a summary, with the permission of the editor, of October 3, 1965.

THIS unusual sighting occurred near Exeter, New Hampshire on the evening of September 3, 1965. four extraordinarily bright red pulsating lights were seen hovering low in the sky. According to Patrolman Eugene Bertrand of the Exeter Police Station, this sighting was first observed about 12:30 A.M. by a youth who had been riding along Route 101 for 12 miles by a tractor-trailer truck. The youth, according to Bertrand, was "pretty shook up" when he reported it to the police station.

Approximately half an hour after this event, Patrolman Bertrand and Patrolman Cocklin were cruising along Route 101 when Bertrand observed the same phenomenon. "There were four pulsating red lights hovering very low over the treetops," Bertrand said. "I pulled the cruiser to the side of the road and Cocklin and I observed the lights for at least 10 to 15 minutes." Bertrand radioed the station that they were sending the cruiser to investigate and that the lights appeared to be about 300 yards away and over an open field. When the cruiser arrived at the scene, the lights had traveled to a point over some trees, where they hovered for a few minutes and then shot straight up and disappeared.

DURING this period, Patrolman Bertrand stated, the lights appeared to fluctuate in brightness and pulsate. He emphasized that the lights were red in color and extraordinarily bright, even brighter than a car spotlight. The sighting was also observed from several other locations around Exeter, and Bertrand said he knew of at least four other independent witnesses. The sighting was also observed for a few minutes by a woman at a nearby residence, who stated that the lights appeared to be about 300 yards from her home. She too said they were very bright and pulsating.

Soon after the sighting, a local resident, Reginald Prescott, telephoned the Exeter Police Station. He stated that at about 1:45 a.m. he had seen some lights in the sky. He was quite shaken and frightened, according to Bertrand. Prescott stated that the lights had hovered over his home for several minutes, then suddenly shot straight up and disappeared. Bertrand was unable to get any details from Prescott about the size, shape or other characteristics of the lights he had seen. The Prescott sighting was apparently independent of the earlier one observed by Bertrand and Cocklin.

Officer Bertrand stated that he flashed his cruiser spotlight back and forth. Muscarello signaled the lights several times, but there was no apparent response. The lights appeared to be a large, dark object, carrying a straight line of lights.
