I started to see gating gladdys. I ran to the field glass. I tried to see them move but they seemed to move fast than the eye could see. I could see no lights and would say they moved about 10 degree from staring point in 5 to 8 seconds. They seemed to blend in with the stars and would not maintain contact with them very long. I would lose them and then relocate. They seemed to move at a high speed and would dart off in a straight line. I watched them from 6:35 to 7:20 P.M. I believe what I saw was some type of unexplained phenomena. I have a good knowledge of astronomy, but cannot explain what I saw. I watch the stars night after night and have never seen anything like this before. I hope this helps explain what I saw. Please advise if you need any additional information.
