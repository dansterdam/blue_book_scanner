Dear Major.
Thank you for your letter of june 24th with reference to the unidentified object which I reported seeing on the evening of May 13th.
In the first place, I would like to mention that I am a serious and objective observer, and have no vested interest in the subject of unidentified flying objects. I am simply interested in learning the truth, whatever it may be.
The object which I observed was circular in shape, and was emitting a bright glow, not unlike a fluorescent light. It appeared to be stationary at first, then suddenly shot upward at a tremendous speed, far exceeding the speed of any known aircraft. 
After watching it for several minutes, it disappeared from sight. I have no explanation for what I saw, and can only assume that it was some type of unidentified flying object.
I hope this additional information is helpful in your investigation. Please let me know if you require any further details.
Sincerely,
[Name Redacted]
