There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

Dear Mrs. Plumb:
The two UFO reports from the Azores and Portugal were not received here. If you are enclosing a copy of the Associated Press release, please forward them as the originals were destroyed. I am a technician who was repairing the system.
