The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

We were discussing a bright light in the sky which I had seen several times, and I told that my sighting was approximately at the same time as that of Mrs. Mary H. ... (she could not possibly identify the light as any kind of aircraft which he could not identify the light as anything which he could not IDENTIFY). 

I recommend that my report of 7 September 1964, the same as this report, should be entered into the records to substantiate the investigative action on reports of UF5 as there was no further action on this case as given in the AFSK report dated 8 July 1964.
