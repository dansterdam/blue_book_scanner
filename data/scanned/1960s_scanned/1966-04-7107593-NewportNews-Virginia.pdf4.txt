1. Astronomical Conditions: Captain Frederick A. Trippe, USAF, Chief of Navigator Training, 4500 Air Base Wing Instrument School, stated the planets were visible in the area of the sighting on 20 April 1966.

2. Interception Action Taken: None.

3. A T-33 aircraft approaching Langley AFB for a landing was in the area of the sighting at approximately 2335 zulu.

4. This report was prepared by Captain James R. Lewis, Jr., USAF, Air Force Wing Operations Division, Langley AFB, Virginia. I believe the object sighted was a T-33 aircraft which was approaching Langley AFB for a landing on 20 April 1966. The flight path of the object close to the horizon, and reduced power on the aircraft coupled with the distance of the sighting would have accounted for the observers not hearing any sound. During the investigation, I have observed T-33 aircraft from approximately the same angle and under similar light conditions which prevailed at the time of the sighting, and have noted an optical illusion in which the aircraft appears to assume the shape of the shipping of a larger object.

5. Existence of physical evidence: None.
