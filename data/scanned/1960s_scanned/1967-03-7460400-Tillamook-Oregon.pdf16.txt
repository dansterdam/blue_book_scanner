1. The enclosed materials are results of an investigation conducted 15 March 1967 at Tillamook, Oregon on UFOs sighted 11 and 13 March 1967 in and around Tillamook, Oregon.

2. Results of the investigation are somewhat inconclusive. The 628th Radar Sq. tracked a metallic object, judging by strength of radar return, with quite unusual movement characteristics. The local civilians observed the object/lights which moved in a zig-zag fashion and discharged reddish-orange units emitting particles or sparks. No units observed any flight in that area these evenings. All sources but one, available to this investigator, were choked with negative results. The definite track of the unknown by Rt. Hebo radar further complicates any correlation with known aluminum reflective objects. The definite object appeared to descend rapidly from 40,000 feet to 20,000 feet, and acceleration the object would have to see to accelerate to 1200 mph and decelerate to 0 within one minute, is fast for known helicopter type a/c.

3. The enclosed tapes of eye witness reports were made on an AFRTA (brand) battery-operated portable tape recorder. The reports are 1 1/4 IPS, half track. Other materials included should be self-explanatory.
