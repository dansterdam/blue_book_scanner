This document page contains two sketches, but no photograph. The image on the left appears to be a compass rose diagram with labeled cardinal directions, while the two images on the right depict a person standing in the middle of a landscape or road.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output:

"HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO YOUR DESTINATION WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SYSTEM BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. AND DRAW A CURVED, DOTTED LINE SHOWING THE COURSE IT FOLLOWED. INDICATE WITH ARROWS WHICH WAY IT MOVED. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH."
