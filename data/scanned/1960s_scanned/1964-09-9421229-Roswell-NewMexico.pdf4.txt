There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document containing a handwritten letter.

Dear sirs:
The information I received is not at what I would like to know. During the examination of all aspects, I found that the report was incorrect and inaccurate, and ask if you could possibly send 6 or 20 reports, balloons, etc. and information on your analysis, procedures are almost completed and details will be provided to you later.
Possibly could send a photograph or two of some U.F.O.s.
