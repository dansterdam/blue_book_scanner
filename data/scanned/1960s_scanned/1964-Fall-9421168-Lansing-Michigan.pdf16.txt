THING SIGHTED OVER SAN ANGELO
It was reported flying over the western section of San Angelo about 7:30 p.m. Thursday, according to Charles Hess, a resident of 1223 Wescott Drive. He said it looked like a little satellite. "Something the size of a softball and almost as bright was flashing red and green lights. At times it would fade out and then reappear," Hess said. He said the object was visible for about three minutes and that he had observed it through field glasses. Another resident, Frank Robinson, said he had seen the object and that it appeared to be about the size of a basketball. "It looked like it was dancing in the air," he said. MEANWHILE, in another part of the state, the Lubbock man who said he saw a thing through the lights Thursday said he saw something he had never seen before. He said the object seemed to be about 40 to 50 feet across and was visible about 30 seconds.
