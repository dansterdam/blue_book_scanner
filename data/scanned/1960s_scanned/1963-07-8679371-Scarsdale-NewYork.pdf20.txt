TWO BOY'S HAVE BOXED
The incident they described is as follows:
On 13 July 1962 two boys, aged 13 and 12, were in a wooded area near Scarsdale, New York, when they observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to be moving erratically, sometimes hovering, sometimes darting rapidly in various directions. The boys watched the light for some time, then it disappeared.
After the light went out, the two boys say they heard a humming sound and saw a dark object descend rapidly and land on the ground about 50 yards from where they were standing. The object was described as oval in shape and about 30 feet in diameter. The surface appeared to be metallic and it had no visible windows, doors or protrusions.
The two boys stated they felt a strange sensation come over them as the object approached and landed. They reported that their bodies seemed numb and they had difficulty speaking or moving. When the object landed, a bright beam of light shot from it to the ground, and the boys said they were temporarily blinded by the intensity of the light.
After a short period of time, the light went out and the object rose rapidly and silently back into the sky where it hovered briefly before speeding away at a terrific rate of speed.
The boys said the incident lasted about 15 minutes. They reported no physical after-effects, but both stated they were quite frightened by the experience.
The report of this incident was submitted to Project Blue Book by the Postal Inspector at Scarsdale.
