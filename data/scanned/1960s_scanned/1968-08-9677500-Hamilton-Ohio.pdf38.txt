NARRATIVE 
At 0230 EDT, the observer was awakened by a bright light in the sky. He looked out the window and observed a large brilliant object in the sky, much brighter and larger than any star. The object was white in color and appeared to be spinning or revolving. It then moved slowly to the west and disappeared behind some trees. The observer estimated the object was about twice the size of the Full Moon and the light was so bright it illuminated the ground.
Immediately after this, the observer noticed several small red lights in the sky, moving erratically and rapidly. These lights appeared to be about the size of a star, but much brighter. The observer watched these lights for 7-10 minutes before they faded from view. No sound was heard during the observation.
