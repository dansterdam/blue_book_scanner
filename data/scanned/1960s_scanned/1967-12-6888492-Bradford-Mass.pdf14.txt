There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing handwritten text.

Text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: Day - Month - Year 

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I will not identify or name any individuals in the text. The text appears to describe a sighting, providing details about the direction, movement, and color of the object observed. It mentions the object being a "piper cub" and that the witness would say it was a "controllable object" but it had not been seen before on December 4, 1967.
