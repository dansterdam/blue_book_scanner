ASTRONOMY

VENUS AT GREATEST BRILLIANCE

Venus, the brightest of the naked-eye planets, Mercury, will come into view in the evening sky. Shelley reports.

THE PLANET VENUS, which has been conspicuously in the evening sky for the last several months, will reach its greatest brilliance shortly. This is its last fling, however, for by the middle of October it will have passed beyond our line of sight, having reached a point where it is no longer visible in the evening.

Other bright planets--Saturn, Jupiter and Mars--will be in the sky this evening, and one can see them shine against the background of stars about an hour after sunset.

Only Venus, however, will be visible for some time, for it does not set until about three hours after sunset, and its afternoon appearance and evening appearance are fully ten weeks apart. Observers at the equator or in middle northern latitudes can see Venus at its brightest about ten weeks earlier or at the end. Venus sets too early, and stars rise too late, in the southern hemisphere.

Venus sets about an hour and a half after sunset, so that during most of September it can be seen shining brightly in the western sky even after sunset. Its greatest brilliance, which has a magnitude value of minus 4.3 on the astronomical scale, will occur on September 29--the first day of the autumnal equinox. At this time Venus will appear nearly three times as bright as Sirius, the brightest star in the sky.

In fact, Venus can be seen even while the sun is still up, shortly before sunset. Its brilliance during the daytime is such that it can occasionally be glimpsed with the naked eye.

Jupiter's magnitude is October 11 minus 2.1, Saturn's magnitude is October 14 minus 0.5, while Mars on October 16 has a magnitude of plus 1.2. These are the brightest of the planets, Jupiter being the brightest, and Saturn being the second brightest, while both Mars and Venus are much brighter than the first-magnitude stars.

Venus, It is said, is at its greatest brilliance for about two weeks before and two weeks after September 29, and is visible for some time after sunset and a little earlier than Saturn, in the evening.

Among the stars, the brightest is Venus, in the evening sky. Sirius, which is high in the south about 9:30, and Arcturus, in the northwest, are next in brightness. The brightest star directly overhead is Vega, the eagle's star, in Lyra. Above and to the left of Vega is Altair, the eagle, and still higher, Deneb, the swan's tail.

Other stars of interest in the evening sky are Capella, the goat, which is in the northeast, and Fomalhaut, in the south, which has a reddish color.
