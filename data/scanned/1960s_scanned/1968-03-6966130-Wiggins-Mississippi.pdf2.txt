The image appears to contain a handwritten document, but does not seem to contain any photographs. As an OCR system, I will proceed to extract the text from the document:

APR 60-17(CC)
INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING. 

The rest of the text in the document is redacted and not visible in the image.
