The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

J. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting: None known.

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
Ledis H. Parge, Capt., USAF Investigating Officer. His comments indicate that the observed object had an unusual shape and motion, and that local radar was unable to detect the object. The report suggests that the object could have been some kind of early jet or experimental aircraft, but that the apparent protrusions could have been caused by insufficient information.

I. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs: None.
