What ever the object was, it definitely descended from a high altitude to abruptly whine past and disappear in the skies. At the time it was traveling through the area, it created a marked silence nor could its movement be accompanied by the sound normally characteristic of aircraft. The man reported to have seen the object said the thing startled him and on passing went out of sight in seconds, leaving him puzzled as to what he had observed.
