7/26-27/67 - NEWTON, N.H. -
At this time of night, Acoustics are such that traffic can sometimes be heard up to 5 miles away. The object never passed in-front-of or behind-of anything while in the area.
The speed of the object was constant and although no estimate was made, it was computed to be only several hundred miles per hour. It was compared to the speed of a jet fighter, which was estimated as 600-800 mph in that area.
The object moved back- and-forth in Westerly and Easterly flight paths. The object's movements appeared to have been a search pattern. No specific direction was indicated that they were looking at NNE and ENE flight terminus points, or as are of complete pattern that would have been oriented to MLS and other range marker.
The time lasted between estimates of 5-10 minutes. Such maneuvers would be those of a jet fighter in course corrections and variations between estimates of 5-10 miles such maneuvers in the order of 2 to 3 minutes. Ten such maneuvers in 30 minutes would mean an angular velocity for the object of approximately 10+ degrees per minute.
