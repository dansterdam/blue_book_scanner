UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
OVER HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT
8 SEPTEMBER 1960

(CONFIDENTIAL) DOCUMENT

1. On 8 September 1960, Mrs. John P. Jones, of 12 High Street, Hartford, Connecticut, reported to the Hartford Police Department that she had seen an unusual object in the sky over her home at approximately 6:00 P.M. that evening.

2. According to Mrs. Jones' statement, the object was a metallic, circular craft approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, hovering at an altitude of about 1,000-1,500 feet. The object made no sound and was observed for a period of approximately 5-10 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared in a northeasterly direction.

3. The local police department and the Air Force's Project "Blue Book" were notified of the sighting. An investigation was immediately initiated.

4. Upon arriving at the scene, officers from the Hartford Police Department interviewed Mrs. Jones and obtained a written statement from her. Mrs. Jones appeared to be credible and her account of the incident was deemed reliable.

5. No other witnesses to the event were found in the immediate vicinity. A search of the area revealed no physical evidence or residue that could be attributed to the reported object.

6. Project "Blue Book" analysts examined the case and concluded that there was insufficient data to determine the nature of the reported object. The case was classified as "UNIDENTIFIED".
