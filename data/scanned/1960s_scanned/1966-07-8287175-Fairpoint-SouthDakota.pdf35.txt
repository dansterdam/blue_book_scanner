Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the direction in compass when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "78" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
