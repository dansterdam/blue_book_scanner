9 January 1961

Dear Doctor Hynek:

I am enclosing a letter from the Troy, Ohio Rotary Club requesting assistance in February on the subject of unidentified flying objects.

If you can possibly do so, I would like to have you speak to this group. As a University scientist supporting the Air Force position, I think you would carry a great deal more weight than some member of the Air Force.

If you can handle this one, would you contact Mr. Heiss direct and let me know?

Sincerely,
(Signature)
