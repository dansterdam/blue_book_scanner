There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document or report.

The report text is as follows:

The incident, which occurred that the reported time, was not seen clearly. Confirmation, or refutation, of the incident is still dependent on further satellite and other data reductions.

The data gathered by other agencies at the time seem more definitive of the subject of the incident, to some degree, than the initial NORAD tape. This is probably due to the fact that they used more sensitive and sophisticated instrumentation.

On the action taken by the subject, it is still not ascertained whether it came from the object. There is no evidence of any sound from the object, nor was any sound heard in the vicinity. It was not seen by any other sources surrounding the object, its altitude, speed or maneuvers.

He believes that the sonar and radar contacts registered were probably the result of unusual atmospheric conditions or equipment malfunction, rather than an actual object. The visual sightings by the individuals, however, cannot be dismissed so easily.

There are some discrepancies in the statements, and no other sound or visual observations by other witnesses in the immediate area were obtained to collaborates the initial report. It appears that it may have been a series of related, but not necessarily connected occurrences, rather than a single, definable incident.
