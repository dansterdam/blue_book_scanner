There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes, faded away slowly at terrific speed.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound: no sound b. Color: intense white light, saucer-shaped, landing device
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered? about 1/10 or less
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
