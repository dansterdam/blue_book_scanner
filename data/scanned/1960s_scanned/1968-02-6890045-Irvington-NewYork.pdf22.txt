The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing a UFO sighting.

The text from the document is as follows:

The object was described as "oval" or "crescent" shaped and as having a glow which was difficult to describe. The nature of the light were "whitty", "reflected light", and "pale, bluish-white light".

Size of the object was estimated by _____ to be 25 to 30 feet across. It was also estimated that the car was approximately 100 feet from the object. No sound was heard.

The length of the sighting was variously estimated by the witnesses to be from one minute to five or ten minutes. After some discussion on how "weird" the object appeared, the men decided to go back to Vashon and bring friends to the site.

______ returned to the area with a friend, ______, parked the car on the main road and both men walked into the pit area on the access road. Upon rounding the curve of the access road and gaining a view of the gravel pit, they observed the object.

The object had moved from its original position to a point, according to their account, which was across the road from its viewing point. Around this point the object seemed to shine a beam of light on the bank at the far end of the pond on which, the first sighting.

______ described the object as being lens shaped, about the size of a compact station wagon and made of shiny metal. As was the case with the other witnesses, he had difficulty describing the quality of the light radiated by the object. He was insistent, however, that the light appeared to be reflected and not generated from within the object.
