The image contains a sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch depicts an object in the sky, with lines indicating its position and movement. There is also a compass-like illustration in the top right corner.

27. In the following sketch, I imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the survey that shows how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same survey to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
