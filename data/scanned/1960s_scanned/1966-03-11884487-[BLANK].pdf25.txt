TRANSCRIPT:

"NICAP emphasizes it is not attacking USAF UFO sightings. "We realize they are under strict orders to explain away sightings and deny that, even though some of the attempted explanations seem ridiculous."

"Dangers from official secrecy are increasing," says NICAP.

"Several times, airline captains have had to maneuver violently to avoid collisions with UFOs, resulting in passenger injuries. There is a growing risk of accidental war from mistaking UFO formations for a secret enemy attack."

"We recommend all UFO secrecy be ended, except for classified radar, aircraft speeds and similar points. We urge that the USAF tell all pilots what to do if they encounter a UFO - either to land, or to continue flight or to take other action."

In a direct statement to NICAF, House Minority Leader Gerald Ford says: "If the Air Force is right, it will clear up the problem. If they are wrong, they should be criticized."

"NICAP agrees that the time has come to stop withholding the truth about UFOs from American citizens."
