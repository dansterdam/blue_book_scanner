The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing the characteristics of "Echo" satellites, which are 600 to 700 miles high and visible to the naked eye, though not as bright as the Echo satellites. The document also mentions that when photographing these satellites, the photographer should try a time exposure to improve the quality of the picture. Finally, the document is signed by James C. Manatt, Colonel, USAF, Director of Technology and Systems.

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

3. The Echo satellites are 600 to 700 miles high and are quite bright. The Echo A satellite is about 3500 miles high and although it is not as bright as the Echo satellites, it is visible to the naked eye.

4. When photographing these satellites Mr. Manatt is bound to get just a point source of light. However, if he wishes to improve the quality of his picture he should try a time exposure.

5. We are returning Mr. ........'s photo to you. Because of the poor quality, we did not feel it was necessary to have any photo analysis done.
