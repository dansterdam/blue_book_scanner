The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

There was no sound, no heat, no changes of color or other phenomena noted. The object appeared to be of pure, hazy white, definitely solid-looking, and did not appear to have any observable structure. It was under observation for about 20 seconds. Mr. Brown's camera, with which the picture was taken, is an old type which has no shutter, but merely has the lens opened and then closed again, with an estimated time of a fill and a fixed speed of about 1/20th of a second. It uses size 120 picture film which was used to take the picture.

The Technicolor company also has facilities for the processing of motion picture color footage and offers special rates to its employees. Because of this, Mr. Brown had his film developed and prints made by the company. The UFO encounter resulted in some unexpectedly clear prints which showed an indication that the print has been "doctored." The print showed no characteristics which could be interpreted as being related to any known air object. The object gave the subject a sense of motion. Mr. Brown said the negatives were cut and not one continuous roll. The UFO photograph was one of the last frames.
