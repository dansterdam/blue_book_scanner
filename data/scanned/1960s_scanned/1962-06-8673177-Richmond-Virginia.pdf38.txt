ASTRONOMY

Venus, Jupiter and Saturn Shine

During June, Venus shines brilliantly in the west during twilight, while Jupiter and Saturn, appearing in the cast later in the evening, James Stokley reports.

Venus is now quite high in the west after sunset, and can be seen for several hours. It is a brilliant and sparkling object, far outshining any other object in the sky. Even the fixed stars cannot compete with its brilliance. Its brightness is equal to about six times that of the first magnitude star, Sirius, the brightest star in the sky.

Venus is now moving rapidly, and you can actually see its change in position in the course of an hour or two. If you check it at the same time each day, you will find that it has shifted noticeably to the west. During the month, it will shift through about one-sixth of the distance between the horizon and the zenith, or overhead point in the sky.

Both Jupiter and Saturn are now in the eastern evening sky. Jupiter in particular is a beautiful sight, being a brilliant yellowish-white object. Saturn, although not as bright, is also easy to see, being of a more yellowish color.

At first glance, one might mistake Jupiter for Venus, which is to the west. However, Jupiter moves much more slowly than Venus, so that in the course of the evening you can see it shift its position noticeably to the west. Venus, on the other hand, shifts much more rapidly over the same interval of time.

Saturn rises a little later than Jupiter. It can be identified by its paler, more yellowish color. It is located to the east of Jupiter, fairly high in the southeast sky.

As the season progresses, Venus will continue to shift westward, and Jupiter and Saturn will become higher in the evening sky. The constellations surrounding them will also be changing with the seasons. So this is an interesting time to observe the shifting positions of the planets.
