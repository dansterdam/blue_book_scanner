The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present on this page. 

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"At 0652, 25 August 1975, the radio satellite was visible and precistently observed from airborne and ground observers on the flight line.

The object was observed maneuvering in a manner which could scarcely be described as that of a normal satellite.   Its visual motions were apparently erratic and could be described as "eccentric".

In conclusion, I believe that these sightings were nothing more than the appearance of the normal radio satellite to persons who are not familiar with the precise motions of such satellites.  The apparent erratic motions are not uncommon and are explicable in terms of the satellite's orbital mechanics. The conclusion is that this sighting represented the visual observation of an artificial earth satellite, and was not an "unidentified flying object" in the popular sense of the term."
