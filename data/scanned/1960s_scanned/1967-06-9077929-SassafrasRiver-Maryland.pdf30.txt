Dear Sirs:

The most interesting thing that happened to me on June 15, 1967 at Holy Trinity Church at Dayton from 11:30 to 12:30 was that a UFO was sighted by our entire class and it caused quite a sensation.
Our radio station WFLN reported it we gave them the details and they reported it all over the news paper also gave it to the local university. BUT it was a graphic report of some kind and when first seen about the size of a half dollar when seen at the police station it had grown to about fifteen feet in diameter and they report it to be dome shaped and the disc glare.
