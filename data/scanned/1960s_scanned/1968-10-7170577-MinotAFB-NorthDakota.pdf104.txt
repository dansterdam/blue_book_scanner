DISCUSSION OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Weather conditions were such that there were haze and scattered clouds in the area of the sighting. There was also a temperature inversion at the 2 - 2,000 ft altitude level. Stars could be seen and this was indicated in all the AF Forms 117 submitted to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

A. The sighting was the brightest astronomical object in the skies during the period of the sighting. It has a stellar magnitude of -1.53, has characteristic colors of blue-red-white-green, and would have been visible in the south-eastern sky during most of the sighting. (See Atch #1)

B. The scintillation of Sirius would have been increased by the temperature inversion.

C. Celestial objects seen through haze are often misinterpreted. (See Atch #2)

D. Clouds passing in front of the star could have caused it to disappear and then reappear.

E. Stationary lights when seen against a black background can appear to move. This process is called autokinesis. (See Atch #3)

F. 1. Initial report indicated a simultaneous ground visual and air visual at about 0335 local. This was not substantiated by the pilot's own 377. The pilots indicated he sighted an unidentified item at about 0335 local.
