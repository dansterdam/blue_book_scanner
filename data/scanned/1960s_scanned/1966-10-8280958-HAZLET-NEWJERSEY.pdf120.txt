I have a keen interest in aviation and follow this news with intensity. I knew the light I saw did not fit in the normal flight patterns and speed of any known aircraft. It was very fast and extremely maneuverable, making 90 degree turns, hovering and accelerating out of sight in a matter of seconds.
33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
saw this for about 30 min. and reported it to the tower at Lakehurst Naval Air Station
