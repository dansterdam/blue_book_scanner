There is no photograph present in this page from the old UFO report document. The page contains only text, which I will now produce as output:

the full moon. It was bluish or metallic colored, and was surrounded by a blue haze, mixed with white.

According to the object remained stationary, tilted toward the South, all this time, and then emitted a brilliant white flash, like a magnesium flare or bomb. Immediately after the flash, the object was gone, and looked about for it but did not see it.

According to who looked later and just caught a brief glimpse prior to the white flash, the light did flash a brilliant magnesium white. But then the object travelled at high speed from due east toward the south, finally disappearing behind trees in the west-southwest. The whole movement took about 2.5 seconds.

The object showed no features, but had a definite (elliptical) shape. It was silent. 

This sighting was very brief, lasting a total of no more than 3-4 seconds. Little can be learned from it, but Rodgers' description tallies with an airborne photo mission, the disc being a "moonlit rotor disc." This is a weak explanation, however, unless the haze can be accounted for. If version is taken (and may simply have failed to acquire the moving object after the initial flash), then no explanation in conventional terms can be offered. There is no basis for a choice between the reports.

The sky was reported as cloudless and perfectly clear; in addition, the campus was dark.
