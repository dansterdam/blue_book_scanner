The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing UFO sightings and efforts by the Air Force to investigate and study selected facets of UFO activity.

Text from the document:

disseminate news on UFO sightings, and send their own investigators to interview citizens who have seen unidentified aerial objects.

A literature has developed on the subject, ranging from the serious to the remotely relevant. Many of the civilian organizations feel that the Air Force effort to document and evaluate sightings is inadequate, and that a full Congressional inquiry on the subject should be held.

Manzel and Boyd state that "most UFO organizations cling to the belief that a conspiracy exists to conceal the existence of extraterrestrial vehicles, but they disagree on its precise composition."

The Air Force steadfastly has stated that it "does not seek to limit discussion on such reports and does not withhold or censor any information pertaining to this unclassified program." Recommendations to expand the Air Force project now are under consideration and a consultant group, as noted above, soon will undertake an intensive, comprehensive study of selected facets of UFO activity.
