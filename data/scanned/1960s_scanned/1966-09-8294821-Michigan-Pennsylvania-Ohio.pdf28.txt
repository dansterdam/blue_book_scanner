TDESER/V. D. Bryant/m3b/rolo/6 Oct 66
Evaluation of 17 September 66 UFO Sighting

1. There is insufficient information pertaining to the detailed evaluation to be made. However, in view of the fact that the time of this sighting (which appears to be an air investigation) is given as 0300, a logical assumption can be made that this UFO occurrence was non-visual.

2. Many articles have been written concerning the fact that sightings, recurring with frequency, have no consistent pattern or value which has a very large radar scope size, and hence would require a special radar which may, or may not, be available. This is inferred from the information furnished that "the light was seen at 35000 ft. on the height finder."
