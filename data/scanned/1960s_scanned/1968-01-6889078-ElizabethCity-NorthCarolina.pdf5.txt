From South to Northeast, but it was ahead, seemed North again, it was and blurred and oval shape, it was white in color, it was like a helicopter, it had no sound at all, determined the size of light, the object got brighter & brighter than it.
Remember January 12, 1965, having a poor visibility. Near the horizon a sighted & I thought it was the plane but Notice it move, it came from the East going slow, it was real bright as star, with no sound at all. Then it brightened up more, a nice & slow a strange object hovering about 10:00 o'clock then it became & was clearly that not cover the object move, the object disappears.
