22 March 1966

SUBJECT: FLYING OBJECT 
FROM: Mr. and Mrs.

1. Mr. ... stated he was hesitant to tell anyone about what he saw and heard until he read in the paper about a similar object reportedly seen by a group of people in Michigan last week.

2. "We were laying back on the bed watching the late show about 1 A.M. Suddenly this noise coming from above. The brightness of the lights lit up the whole apartment. The lights were flashing up and down, up and down. They appeared to move around outside our window. The flashing lights were white and smokey, lots of smoke and noise too". A howl, or more like a horn, more like a siren, yet different repeating sound from whirling copter, and all the time this bright light showed on both walls as if it was illuminating the whole room. They both jumped up to look out, so much smoke all around. I pulled on my pants and when I got down the steps the outside air was still full of smoke. The object seemed to have some straight up. Would guess the object was about five feet across and emitted a glow, no one else in the apartment saw or heard the object.
