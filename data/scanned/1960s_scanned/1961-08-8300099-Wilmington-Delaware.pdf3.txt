The handwritten text states:
"We were looking out of the bedroom window when all of a sudden a bright star appeared, and the object looked around for a while and then seemed to disappear. I got my binoculars and looked at it with binoculars as it seemed to rise upward and move in a lateral direction at a very fast rate of speed. It left a trail behind it that looked like about a 40x (forty power) binocular view. It was about 8:30 P.M. and the sky was clear."
