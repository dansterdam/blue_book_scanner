A NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE PRINT OF ANY ITEM, EVENT, OR ACTIVITY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE IS ATTACHED AND MARKED ACCORDINGLY.

The text in the document reads:
"Continuous lights in the sky, possibly minature 20-30' above the ground, showing small signs of movement, rapidly shifting in a sharp descent, and hovering for quite some time. Had light havening under its way for about 30 minutes, in a shape of a diamond and rounded at the ends. It seemed to be in a stabilized position, moving only to descend and ascend again. When watched it moved slowly, moving in a jerking motion (possibly) taking still in a curved line. It would be impossible to estimate its size, but it was not consistent to be any known airborne object. It moved in a pattern unknown to me, and when observing it, it seemed to disappear from sight."
