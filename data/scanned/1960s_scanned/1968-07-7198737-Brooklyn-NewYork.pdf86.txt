The image contains two sketch-like illustrations. The top illustration appears to be a compass or radar-like diagram with various directions and labels such as "NNW", "ESE", and "W". The bottom two illustrations depict landscapes, with one showing a person standing on a hilltop overlooking a landscape, and the other showing a cloudy sky above a mountainous terrain.

TEXT FOUND IN THE DOCUMENT:

T. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON, WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION AS A LAST SEEN. IN SOME CASES, IT IS AUTOMATIC WITH A WITNESS TO DIRECT HIS ATTENTION TOWARD THE PHENOMENON IMMEDIATELY, WHICH WOULD PLACE THE "X" AND "Y" VERY CLOSE TOGETHER. HOWEVER, IF THE WITNESS WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR SOME TIME, THE "X" AND "Y" MAY BE SOME DISTANCE APART.
