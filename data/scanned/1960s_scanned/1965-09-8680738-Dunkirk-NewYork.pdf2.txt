REPORT OF THE AERIAL PHENOMENA INVESTIGATION TEAM
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

REPORT NO: 9,
DATE: May 5, 1965

On 13 September 1964, subject individual reported sighting an unusual object in the sky over Dunkirk, New York. The object was described as being circular in shape, approximately 50 to 60 feet in diameter, and emitting a bright glow. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and departed the area.

The incident was investigated by personnel from the 544th Air Defense Group, New York Air National Guard. A thorough on-site investigation was conducted, including interviews with the subject individual and other witnesses. No evidence of a conventional aircraft or other explainable phenomenon was found. The object remains unidentified.

The subject individual appears to be a credible witness with no known history of false or exaggerated reporting. The report is considered to be of significant interest due to the extended duration of the sighting and the rapid acceleration of the object upon departure.

RECOMMENDATION: Subject report be forwarded to appropriate authorities for further evaluation and analysis.
