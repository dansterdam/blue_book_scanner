Lancashire sky puzzle
On the evening of Sunday, September 8, 1963, a married couple who live near Pendlebury, Lancashire, witnessed a strange light in the sky which they described as unusual.
The light appeared at about 8:30pm in the west, just above the horizon, and moving slowly towards the northeast. It seemed to be about the size of a large star, but much brighter. The light also appeared to oscillate up and down slightly as it moved.
The couple watched the light for about five minutes before it disappeared behind trees. They said the light gave an impression of being solid and substantial, not like an ordinary star, and obviously closer than the stars. It seemed to be under intelligent control and did not flicker or twinkle like a star.
The light was definitely not any known aircraft, either civil or military. It moved in a very slow, unconventional manner quite unlike any aircraft. When it disappeared, it simply faded out, rather than going out of sight in the normal way that aeroplanes do.
The couple are reputable people and their evidence is considered reliable. They had no reason to invent or exaggerate what they saw. This phenomenon, whatever it was, has not so far been satisfactorily explained.
