The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch depicting a UFO and some surrounding elements. The sketch shows a large oval labeled "THE U.F.O.", a road labeled "DOWN THE ROAD", a motel, a field, and some trees. The date "JUNE 27, 1966" is also written at the bottom of the image.

Here is the text from the document, as extracted by an OCR system:
