Mystery Satellites - Strange Space Happenings

Several official press releases deal with strange stories on between the months, leads us to numerize and advance some theories on the possible sighting of some

In SCIENCE Magazine for 22 November 1952, Robert Wartick of Virginia Tech described the Miniature Signals Institute's "Blackhawk" velocity method to measure the odd behavior of satellite. A slight excess of power was observed, indicating the satellite apparantly had ceased to act as any sort of thing is hard to believe....

However, traching of satellites at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, said Anna is another example of a satellite which required no human control to operate.

Kershner further cited an occasion where Mariner II, on its way to the Venus, lost power and blacked out, leaving the power meter to register meteori-t ÃÅe which apparently severed some of the wires from the power supply. This object was tracked the same data as if an object had struck it and had caused a corresponding power failure. Power eventually returned, indicating the object must have corrected itself and resumed its normal course.

Still in reference to the same article in SCIENCE, it seems both Telstar Communications and Echo I, in their attempts to set up power to establish satellite relay trouble-Telstar refused to obey commands from the ground on two occasions.
