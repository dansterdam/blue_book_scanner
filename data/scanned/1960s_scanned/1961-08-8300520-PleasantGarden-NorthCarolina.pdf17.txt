Gentlemen:

This may be a waste of time, nevertheless, I shall
have seen with the hopes that I may find a logical expla-
nation.

I saw an object about the size of a helicopter, a vig-
orous bright light, white in color, which hovered over the 
hill for about 3 or 4 minutes. I naturally observed whether 
or not it could detect any more craft, but could see none. 
After about 3 or 4 minutes, the object seemed to follow a 
straight course to the southeast, and within a matter of 
about 30 seconds was gone. This was on August 31, 1961 at 
approximately 9:15 pm. The night was dark, no moon and the 
stars were very clearly visible. As the object was moving, 
it was heard and the light was steady and of an orange glow.
It seemed to move at right angles to the horizon, and there 
was no noticeable variation in the intensity of the light.

Your explanation will be appreciated by me, and I hope
that this report may serve in some way to clear up this "ailment".

Sincerely yours,
