Dear Mr. ____,

This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you were unable to identify on the night of August 30, 1965.

A check of the satellite schedules indicates that the object you observed was probably SATI ID JOHN-15 which was passing over the area at 9:12 PM at 67 degrees elevation moving northeast on that date.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
