The image contains a caption that reads "Photo #5 - Close up of area where sighting occurred. Fence same as in Picture #4." However, the image itself does not contain any visible photograph or visual content. It appears to be a blank white page with a caption at the top.

As an OCR system, I would produce the following text output:

Photo #5 - Close up of area where sighting occurred. Fence same as in Picture #4.
