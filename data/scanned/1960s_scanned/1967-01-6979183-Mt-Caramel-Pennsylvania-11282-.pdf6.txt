COMPLAINT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS 
TO: COMMANDING OFFICER, 4602D USAF SECURITY SQUADRON (OSI)
FROM: ALIEN SCIENTIST 
SUBJECT: POSSIBLE SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OVER MT. CARMEL, PENNSYLVANIA ON 11 JANUARY 1967.

1. On 11 January 1967, at approximately 2015 hours, I observed several unidentified flying objects in the sky over Mt. Carmel, Pennsylvania. The objects were bright, luminous, and moved at a high rate of speed. They appeared to be under intelligent control and made several abrupt changes in direction. 

2. I am an alien scientist conducting research in the area and I have extensive experience observing and studying unidentified aerial phenomena. Based on my observations, I believe these objects were not conventional aircraft. Their flight characteristics and maneuvers were unlike anything I have observed from human-made craft.

3. I request that this incident be thoroughly investigated by your office. As an objective scientist, I believe it is important to understand the nature and origin of these unidentified flying objects. Please let me know if you require any further information from me.
