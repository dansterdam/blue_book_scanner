UFO form continued
It was near 10:30 p.m. and around 10:30 p.m. when the object was seen. At first it was far away and difficult to see, but as it came nearer, I could see it was clearly some type of unidentified object. It made no sound, but red lights were blinking on the bottom of the object as it moved. 
At one point, the object stopped in mid-air and hovered, then slowly accelerated away and disappeared. It moved erratically and swiftly. I could not determine the size of the object, but it was larger than a normal aircraft. The weather was clear with stars visible. 
I called the police and they said they had received other calls about the object. I assume others may have reported seeing the object as well. I thought the object might have been some type of experimental aircraft, but I cannot be certain of its identity. It did not resemble any aircraft I have ever seen.
