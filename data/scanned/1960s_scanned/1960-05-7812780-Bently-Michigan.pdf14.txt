Report of Recovery of Unidentified Object

During my tour as Officer of the Day, 28 May 1960, I was contacted at approximately 1030 via telephone by Pvt. Daniel Y. Michigan. His telephone number was Hillsdale 4-3153. His 16 year old son was watching an angle or flaming object falling from a southwesterly direction about 75 feet from his position. The object landed approximately 5 feet from my position. I visually or audibly observed the object as it cooled and was taken to his father. The location of the farm is Standish, Michigan.

I notified Captain Godsey, Base Administrative Officer, who informed me that he would notify Lt.Col. ROLLIN H. STEVENS, BASE OPERATIONS OFFICER, for pickup of the item. I contacted Sergeant ELROD, who I left the base to search the area for the item.

Sergeant ELROD returned at approximately 1515 with the object, which was the remainder of the weekend.

The object is metallic, approximately 1 1/8" by 1" square, and blue-black in color. It appears to be composed of multiple layers or laminations of metal, covered by an oxide. The base metal is not brittle, and would be a tarnished portion of sheet or tubing.

Recommend the object be forwarded for metallurgical analysis

Pictures of this object are requested by S/Sgt ELROD for inclusion to his report to 3:
