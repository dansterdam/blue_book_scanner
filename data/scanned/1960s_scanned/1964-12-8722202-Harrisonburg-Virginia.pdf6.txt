VIRGINIA SAUCER LANDING LEAVES HIGH RADIOACTIVITY: On December 21st, Horace Bugg, a Harrisonburg, Va. gunsmith, was driving on Route 259 a few miles east of Staunton, when he saw a UFO which he estimates to have been about 120 feet in height. The object was at about 300 feet in altitude and was cigar-shaped with a dome on top. It was whitish-green in color and appeared to be spinning or rotating as it passed overhead. As it went through his car's windshield, he noticed that the radio and electrical system were temporarily diminished in power. He also felt a "sense of force" and warmth, which he attributed to the UFO's power. The saucer disappeared at a high rate of speed towards the northeast and east. Bugg later reported that the ground over which the UFO had passed showed a high degree of radioactivity.
