The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, containing handwritten text.

It could be noted that while the image does not contain a photograph, the text states "Photos will be forthcoming", suggesting that photographs may be provided in a later document.

The text in the document is as follows:

It should be noted that while these, during the course of several earlier communications, reports of sightings and disappearances, now or recent in occurrence, have appeared to involve objects or phenomena which cannot readily be accounted for by conventional explanations, corroborating evidence or proofs, of the same, have not been sufficiently conclusive to warrant the formal reporting on these occurrences through channels. It is my opinion that this report, as is, does not lend itself to definitive conclusions or judgements on the nature of the incident or its implications. However, as you will note, the photographs which were to accompany this report have not yet been received. It is possible that these, when obtained, may provide additional information or clarification which could alter the initial assessment of this incident.

Photos will be forthcoming.
