There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book UFO report.

The text in the document reads:

Major Hector Quintanilla
May 29, 1965
Page 2

Unfortunately, this case still remains unknown. Although I feel any further investigation is hopeless, I would suggest that wind direction for this night be established. If from the orientation of the object it could reasonably have been a balloon with a scientific payload, but this seems unlikely.

End of report.

Sincerely,
J. Allen Hynek
