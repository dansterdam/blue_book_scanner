MEMO FOR THE RECORD

Based on telecon with Mr. Dort of FAA, North Olmsted, Ohio

Mr. Dort said that they had picked up an unidentified target on November 11 on their radar. The object was a definite primary target and was in a place where they didn't ordinarily pick up targets. 

Initially the target was at an azimuth of 070 degrees, was traveling about 50 mph and was approximately 20 to 25 miles north of Erie.
Although they have no height finder, Mr. Dort felt that the target would have had to have been quite high. Olmsted lost the object about 8 miles NW of Buffalo. Buffalo lost it at about 3 miles.

There are no scope photos, and no one actually saw the object.

It traveled in a straight line from initial position toward Buffalo.

Mr. Dort said he thought it must be a balloon. He stated that the wind was in the right direction but that he could not find anyone who had launched a balloon that should have been in the area at that time.
