35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific parts of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: First, I want to assure you that I am as anxious as you to solve this case, and I want to cooperate to the fullest extent possible. Let me summarize the information I have: 
On the night of 11 April 1964 my wife and I observed a bright light in the sky over the Springdale area. It was approximately 8:45 pm. The light seemed to be hovering, and at times would hover and then dart off at a very high rate of speed. It would then stop hover again, and then repeat the darting motion. The light was very bright, and at times seemed to be pulsating. It would seem to diminish in size and intensity and then flare up again. The light seemed to be at a high altitude, possibly several thousand feet up. We observed it for approximately 20-25 minutes before it simply disappeared from sight. I am a commercial pilot by profession, so I am quite familiar with aircraft lights, and this was definitely not an aircraft. I had never seen anything like it before, and I have not seen anything like it since. I can assure you that I am quite sane and rational, and this was a genuine unidentified flying object. I am very interested in your findings, and I would be happy to provide any additional information that might be helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
