Dear Mrs. ____
The President has asked that I reply to your letter regarding "flying saucers".

The investigation of unidentified flying objects reported in the skies over the United States is the responsibility of the Air Force. The status report on this project is attached for your information. 

In 13 years of investigating over 8000 reports of unidentified flying objects, the evidence has proved conclusively that reported aerial phenomena have been objects either created and sent aloft by man, generated by atmospheric conditions, or caused by celestial bodies or the reentry or meteors into the earth's atmosphere.

There has never been any evidence that UFOs reported to the Air Force represented extraterrestrial vehicles. No such objects reported to the Air Force have given any indication of a threat to the United States, nor has any evidence been presented that any unidentified flying object exhibited characteristics beyond the scope of current technical or scientific knowledge.

If you have an encounter which you feel should be reported, please use the enclosed AF Form 16B which is used for reporting aerial objects which cannot be identified by the observer to the Air Force. This form should be completed as fully as possible and returned to the following address so that an evaluation can be made: By USAF (SADEOC), Washington, D.C. 20330.
