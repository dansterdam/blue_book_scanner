The image shows a sketch of the sky and a compass diagram. There is no photograph present in this page of the Project Blue Book document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object. And place a "B" on the compass to show where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the motion and a "B" at the end. As stated, the object was going in circles which attracted our attention. It attracted our attention and they referred to it as upwards, a faint object going in circles until it disappeared, then at 11:30 both just disappeared. Such was reported to Lt. Smith and he asked us to a definite course. Then at 11:30 both just disappeared.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? one at first, then two-when they were arrayed, and put on arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
