The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

I would the UFO Project Officer for the Air Force (currently assigned to the Assistant Director of Intelligence) a couple of weeks ago to discuss investigation of recent military personnel at Ft. Pierce, Florida and vicinity. Their sighting a couple of weeks ago was not considered of sufficient importance for further investigation by Project Blue Book. There is a brief pilot. was flying at about 12:30 PM on ..., when his aircraft encountered sighting of an unidentified flying object near Vero Beach, Florida. He stated that the object was round, silver in color, and appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter. The pilot said that the object was traveling at a high rate of speed, and as it passed close to his aircraft, it accelerated and disappeared from sight. This, then, explains the turbulence my aircraft encountered.
