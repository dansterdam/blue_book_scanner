TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
MARS AND VENUS STILL PROMINENT
By February, Mars, the red planet, is still prominent in the southwest sky for a few minutes after sunset or in the early evening. Venus, the evening star, is prominent in the west and increases in brightness until the end of this month. The eclipse track is shown on the star map. It indicates that the path of the eclipse crossed over certain land areas, where they have been organized as great viewing and expedition centers. At the last minute, weather interferes with observations at many stations. This is always a disappointment. However, the eclipse proves valuable scientifically, and serves to awaken the public's interest in astronomy.
