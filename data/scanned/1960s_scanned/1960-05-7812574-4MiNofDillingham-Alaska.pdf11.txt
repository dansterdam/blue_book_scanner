SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
SECURITY INFORMATION
ORIGINATING AGENCY: Hq. 10th Air Division (Def)
SUBJECT: The reliability is difficult to estimate, but he was not evasive and some details of his story correlated with that of the sighting is difficult to explain.
DETAILS: The sighting is a light plane at 2500 feet near Ekuk, south of Dillingham at 9:00/9:30, 1960-05-07. The pilot stated he saw an object on the ground looking up and that it was about 10,000 feet and nearly above him. He stated it was round and silver, with a metallic appearance, much smaller than a small aircraft. The object was in view for about a minute and a half. As the object rose, it made a semi-circular or vertical ascent, then a slight horizontal pass. The incident balloon flight noted over Japan during WWII. He could give no other details. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: At the time of the sighting, the weather was gusty and the object was headed in a breeze of about 15 miles per hour and that the object seemed pretty much into the wind. The pilot also stated some distance perception, but it did seem somewhat larger than a "full moon." The 735th ACWRON at King Salmon picked up a contact at that time, but it was almost due south of Dillingham over the village of Ekuk. The 705th ACWRON at Dillingham also picked up a contact at about 0545 PA 5050, contact lost and faded.
COMMENTS BY INVESTIGATING OFFICER: There still appears to be no logical explanation of the sighting. It is quite obvious that an object was sighted; whether all the details of the sighting are correct cannot be ascertained, however, there is no reason to doubt their essential accuracy. At any rate, it does not appear that a conventional aircraft or balloon was responsible for the sighting.
