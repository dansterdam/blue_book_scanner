The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a page from a document with instructions and diagrams related to UFO observations. The image consists of a diagram showing an angle to measure the height of an object above the horizon, as well as a compass rose diagram. The instructions ask the viewer to draw a picture to show the motion of the object or objects and to indicate how many objects there were, if more than one.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
