The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document discussing the motion of our sun and its relation to other civilizations' astronomers, as well as the potential for planetary systems to sustain life.

motion of our sun would appear to another civilization's astronomers to be satisfied by the presence of one giant dark satellite with a period of about 60 years. This is explained by the approximate commensurability of the periods of rotation of the two largest planets of our solar system: five periods of Jupiter correspond to 59.3 years, two periods of Saturn correspond to 58.9 years.

Gindilis continues, "These arguments are not, of course, strong proof of the existence of planetary systems around many stars. However, they indicate that there is a weighty basis for such an assumption. Most investigators consider that planetary systems are well spread throughout the galaxy and that their number can attain one hundred billion (10^11)."

"Of course, not all planets are suitable for the evolution of life. Evaluating the number of planets with conditions suitable for life is a rather difficult problem, if only because we know nothing about the life forms that can develop on other planets. We shall not consider this question. The reader can find details about this in the exceptional book of I. S. Shklovskiy 'Universe, Life, Intelligence,' in the books of A. I. Oparin and V. G. Fesenkov, 'Life in the Universe' and Kh. Shepli, 'Stars and People.'

The limit for the factor k2 given there lie in the range from 10^-6 to 0.06. From this the number of planets in the galaxy with conditions suitable for life is from 10^3 to 10^10."
