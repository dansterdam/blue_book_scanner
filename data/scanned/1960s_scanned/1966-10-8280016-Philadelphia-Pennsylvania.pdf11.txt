DEAR SIRS
I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT AN INCIDENT CONCERNING AERIAL PHENOMENA
ON THE NIGHT OF OCT. 12 1966 I WATCHED A BLUISH WHITE
OBJECT WHICH I THOUGHT IT WAS ECHO WHICH IS OFTEN SIGHTED
CHANGED DIRECTION I WAS A LITTLE VARY BY MY CONCLUSION. THE
OBJECT FIRST HAD A SLIGHT OVERCAST - IT WAS BRIGHTER
THE SKY. IT MOVED IN A EAST TO WEST DIRECTION THEN STOPPED
APPEARED TO MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE I HENCE TYPE OF WHICH I
HAD SEEN STAR AT SOMETHING TO LONG - IT THEN PROCEEDED IN A NORTH
THEN SOUTHERLY DIRECTION ON MY WAY TO MY FIANCE'S HOUSE WHEN I FIRST NOTICED
IT WHEN I GOT TO HER HOUSE SHE SAID ANY THING THEN I HUNG UP SO DID NOT GIVE HER
SHE SAY ANY THING THAT WAS NOT THERE AS I WALKED FURTHER
THE THING STOP AGAIN SCUDDER AND TAKE ANOTHER COURSE - WHEN I LOST SIGHT OF IT
WHEN I LOST SIGHT OF THE THING IT WAS STILL HEADING NORTH
RATHER THAN THE STRAIGHT LINE IT HAD PREVIOUSLY TRAVELED
HOUSE SHE SAID THAT SHE AND TWO OF HER BROTHER'S OBSERVED
DESCRIBED THE SAME IDENTICAL MOVEMENTS I OBSERVED.
THE OBJECT WAS IN VIEW THEN THE BITTER PART OF NEAR AN HOUR
SEVEN TWENTY TO SEVEN FORTY FIVE. IT TRAVELED ABOUT 120
JUSTINNG HORIZON TO HORIZON AS 180 DEGREES. DURING AND AFTER
AN UNUSUAL ABUNDANCE OF PLANES FLYING IN THE AREA USUALLY
IN A CRISSCROSS MANNER - ONE FLYING HIGH THE OTHER LOW GAS
