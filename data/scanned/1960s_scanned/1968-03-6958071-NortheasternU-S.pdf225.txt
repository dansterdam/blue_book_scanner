MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1963
Conversation with Greater Pittsburgh Airport, Office of Information, indicated that: 
had observed an unidentified flying object on the night of 3 March 1963. Three lines of fire with all defining characteristics of meteor observation: bright enough to light up the area, lasted 10-15 seconds, and disappeared at the horizon.
On 5 March 1963 we attempted to contact Mr.   , however, he was not in. We will call us on 6 March.
On 6 March 1963 Mr.   called the Aerial Phenomena Office. He said that on the night of 3 March 1963 he had observed an object in the southeastern sky at about 2115 hours. He said that at first there were three objects, the one broke into a shower of four objects, like a bridge of flames. They were heading from the south to north, main NNW. He stated that the objects were travelling extremely fast, so fast that they were possibly exhaust but then they became elongated so as to resemble a 30-7 Second like the main object's tail could cover the length of a mile. When the objects disappeared in the north they were flying almost in perfect line abreast. When the front one broke into two the others more or less seemed to shorten, break up and disappear. It disappeared as if they would into the clouds. The visibility was excellent that night. Mr.   could have seen them for a wide angle. He thought Mr.   observed a satellites decay.
