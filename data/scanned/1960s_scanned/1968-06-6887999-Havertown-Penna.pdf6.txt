The image contains two illustrations. The upper illustration is a compass-like diagram with directions labeled around the circumference. The lower illustration depicts a silhouetted figure standing on a road or path, with mountains or hills in the background and an inset diagram of a landscape or horizon.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS POSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE BEARING OR DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. AND A "B" WHERE THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE, CURVED OR STRAIGHT, THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOTION OR FLIGHT PATH OF THE PHENOMENON WAS CURVED OR STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO PLOT A COURSE.
