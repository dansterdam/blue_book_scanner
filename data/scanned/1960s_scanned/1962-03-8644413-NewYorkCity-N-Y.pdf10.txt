"OFFICIAL FILE COPY

TO: 2/Lt Col Friend
UFO Sighting

14 August 1962

HQ USAF
SAFOI-3
WASH 25, D.C.

The following information is provided to assist you in replying to the attached letter from *** stating that on 9 March 33 we received a letter from *** stating that the object was oval in shape and had white smoke trails behind it. It was very fast.

9 March 24 we received a letter from *** who observed the object on 24 February. This information was essentially the same as the description already given. He did not state anything additional that would clarify or expand the previous report. 

This case was evaluated as an attempt at sighting with possible correlation to the daily press and the delay in receiving the complete information, it is not possible to determine the exact time, direction, speed, or altitude involved. The description of the object does not furnish sufficient data for the distance covered by the object. The description was not extensive enough to draw definite conclusions.

THERE IS NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE SIGHTING AND THE APPARENT UNUSUAL LIGHTING EFFECTS NOTED BY PEOPLE ON THE EVENING OF 24 FEBRUARY. THIS LIGHTING EFFECT WAS SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINED AS BEING CAUSED BY THE LAUNCH OF A NASA SATELLITE WHICH OCCURRED AT THAT TIME. THE SIGHTING AND THIS LIGHTING EFFECT APPEAR TO BE ENTIRELY SEPARATE PHENOMENA AND HAVE NO CONNECTION.
