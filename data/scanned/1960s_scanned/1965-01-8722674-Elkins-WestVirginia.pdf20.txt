Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

The U.S. Air Force Technical Information Guide dated 29 June 1955 stated that your reported observation of a UFO over your home on 24 May 1965 had been thoroughly investigated. The enclosed letter is in response to your inquiry about the disposition of that report. We found no evidence to support the existence of an extraterrestrial spacecraft at the time and location you specified. The case is therefore considered closed.

Sincerely,
HAROLD M. STRIDER
Captain, U.S. Air Force
Chief, Project Blue Book
