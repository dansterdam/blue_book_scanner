This office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from College Park, Georgia. 
The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear Mr _____
The sighting on the night of 2 May 1965 is characteristic of a satellite observation. In your discussion you indicate that the object changed direction and speed. However, satellite orbits frequently exhibit these characteristics, and the apparent changes in speed and direction are normal. The passage of the object is about the speed of satellites.

We have checked the Echo and Pegasus schedules and your sighting occurred midway between the passage of Pegasus I at 8:10 pm and Echo I at 8:54 pm. These objects were visible as stated.

There are more than thirty satellites and satellite components visible to the naked eye.

We agree that the object could not have been a meteorite because of the reported duration.

The attached brochure depicts the results of the Air Force program on the subject of unidentified flying objects.
The Air Force regards the books by Donald E Keyhoe on flying saucers as science fiction.
