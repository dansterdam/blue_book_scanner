The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book, that describes an observation made on April 28 at 3:36 a.m. in West Thornton, New Hampshire. The text describes seeing a bright object in the sky that moved toward the east and disappeared.
