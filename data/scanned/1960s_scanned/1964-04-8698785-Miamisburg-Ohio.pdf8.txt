There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a scanned document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  
   Day  -  Month  -  Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Caust to report seeing an unknown object which moved very rapidly and turned into the wind. I was startled into looking up in time to see the object disappear into the night sky.
