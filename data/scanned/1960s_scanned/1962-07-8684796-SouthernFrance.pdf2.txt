Gentlemen:

I would you be so kind as to tell me what object was seen in page erroneous from the recent dispatch. From what I have been told, it was to meet on 13 July 1952 at about 3:15 in the morning, and looked like a star. I count see it for about 30 minutes.

Thank you very much for the information concerning the object.

Respectfully yours,
