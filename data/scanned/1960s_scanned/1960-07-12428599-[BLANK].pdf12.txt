ATIC UFO Investigation Capability

AFCIN-4X3 SAFOI-34 (L/Col Tacker)

1. During July 1960, ATIC participated in a briefing on the Air Force Sub-Committee following the briefing Mr Robert Smart of the House Armed Services Sub-Committee made several recommendations directed at improving the capability of the Air Force to investigate significant sightings.

AFCIN-4X4 All of the recommendations that were made with reference to improving the UFO program have been affected with one exception, the establishment of an additional officer to the UFO Branch to assist with the investigation of reports.

AFCIN-4X5 ATIC has accomplished what we feel is a better solution, the establishment of a special study group of four officers to assist, on a full time basis, those officers with the problem. The UFO investigation requirement is cyclic and more expeditions basic than one officer further, the officers selected for this duty have backgrounds in Meteorology, astronomy, and electronic requirements.
