This image does not contain any photographs, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch shows a compass rose in the upper right corner, and a set of instructions and diagrams related to reporting observations of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the image appears to be instructions for answering various questions about observed objects, including where the object was seen in relation to the horizon, how the object moved, and how many objects were observed.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curved line to show where the horizon (skyline) was when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
