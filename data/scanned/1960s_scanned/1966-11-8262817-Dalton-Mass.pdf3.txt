Here is the text from the document:

Dear Sir,

Objects as reported in December of 1966 continue to be a cause of puzzlement and on many occasions might be mistaken for the usual run of the clouds. We continue to get reports of high and low flying objects. Careful investigation indicates that in many cases these are probably natural phenomena. However, when the objects appear to be structured and seem to maneuver in a purposeful manner, they certainly warrant further study. It was thus while observing an apparent brightly lighted object that it suddenly disappeared and then reappeared in another location, an indication that it was not merely a star or some other celestial body.

We also note several instances where the object was observed from two or more separate locations, confirming the reality of its presence. This lends credence to the report and certainly indicates it was not a figment of the imagination of a single observer.

For the Air Force has not seen this kind of report with any degree of frequency, but more thorough investigation appears warranted.
