The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a handwritten document or report. As an OCR system, I will extract the text from the document:

Please permit. The accompanying sources questionable, however, convicted a number of discrepancies and inconsistencies regarding the direction of flight of the unidentified object and the distance from the site to the object as revealed along with the fact that the photograph was taken through a window glass. Following examination of the photograph by the staff of FDPFF, it was determined that the photographic image is probably a reflection of an object superimposed in front of or behind the camera in the window glass. A more detailed identification of the actual object can not be made from the material and information available.
