PTD Form 164

To whom it may concern: An Unidentified Flying Object, I saw it in the N.W. section of Baltimore. It was flashing back and forth and then it just shot up and seemed to go out of sight. It made a tremendous speed. Three minutes later another object came over headed in a tremendous speed, I have never seen anything like it before.
