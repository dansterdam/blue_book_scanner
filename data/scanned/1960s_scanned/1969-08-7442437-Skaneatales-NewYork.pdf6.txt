TEXT IN THE DOCUMENT:

THE FIRST SKAN-EATLES SIGHTINO OVER SKANEATALES LAKE ON THE EVENING OF AUGUST 7 1969 AS SEEN BY SEVERAL WITNESSES. THE MOVEMENT OF THIS PHENOMENON BETWEEN 12 AND 11 THAT WAS AT A MODERATE TO VERY HIGH SPEED, OFTEN IN IRREGULAR PATTERNS, IS SCHEMATICALLY SHOWN BELOW.
THE DRAWING SHOWS THE TRACK OF THIS OBJECT AS PERCEIVED BY THE WITNESSES. SUCH MOVEMENTS ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF SAUCER-TYPE UFOs, AND ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF OTHER AERIAL PHENOMENA SUCH AS METEORS, SATELLITES, AIRPLANES. ETC. THIS MOVEMENT IMMEDIATELY SUGGESTS THE INVOLVEMENT OF AN INTELLIGENTLY CONTROLLED DEVICE RATHER THAN SOME NATURAL PHENOMENON.
