The image contains a hand-drawn sketch depicting two unidentified flying objects. The sketch shows the objects' shapes and trajectories, with arrows indicating their direction of travel. The sketch is accompanied by descriptive text that provides details about the objects, such as their size, speed, and movement pattern.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:
