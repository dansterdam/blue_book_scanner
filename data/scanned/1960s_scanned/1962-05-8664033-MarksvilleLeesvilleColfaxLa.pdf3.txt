CAR NEAR LEESVILLE, LA. AN INTERVIEW WITH WHO SPOKE FOR AS WELL, DISCLOSED THAT THEIR
SIGHTING WAS ALSO THE RESULT OF A RADIO CALL. THE DECISION OF THE OBJECT WHICH THEY SAW LARGER AND BRIGHTER THAN THE LARGEST AND BRIGHTEST STAR, AND ITS COURSE (NORTHWEST) INDICATE THAT IT PROBABLY WAS A DIFFERENT OBJECT THAN THAT SIGHTED BY THE NORTHWEST. THE SIZE AND FLIGHTLINE (STRAIGHT TOWARD THE NORTHWEST) INDICATE THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A JET WITH THE AFTERBURNER ON.
