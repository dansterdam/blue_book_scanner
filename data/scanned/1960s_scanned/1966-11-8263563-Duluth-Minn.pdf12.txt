The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document with a series of questions and responses related to the sighting of an unidentified object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? No, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: It appeared to approach and was occasionally obscured by a distant rain shower
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes. If you answered YES, then tell what: It appeared to obscure a distant rain shower
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: none
b. Color: usually yellow-white
18. We wish to know the smaller size, field of match stick and much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, about how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? all of it
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protusions, etc., and especially show the direction the object was moving. An illustration is provided showing the outline of the object and its apparent motion.

In summary, the text from the document indicates that the observer saw an unidentified yellow-white object that would have been completely obscured by a match head, and the object appeared to move in and out of clouds and rain showers.
