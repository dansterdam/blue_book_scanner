Text in the document:

As we watched it there, hovering, for ten minutes, we saw it grow a little dimmer. I suggest that we go home for my telescope and bring it back. We can the 3 mile to my house in 3 minutes and I took the car back to the ledge. When we got there, the object was still there but going dim. I tried to get a fix on it but it had already grown dim and my sight on the telescope was off as I haven't used it in nearly six months.

As we left the ledge, the object was still in the same place, still very, very dim.

Could you explain this to me? Four pairs of eyes don't lie!

I am sixteen years old and a Junior in Shamokin Area High School.
