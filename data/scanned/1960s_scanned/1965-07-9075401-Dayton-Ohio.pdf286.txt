SAUCER HOVERS OVER CAR IN WASHINGTON STATE: A JULY 2nd INCIDENT.
Appearing was not expected to the press at all. Mrs. A. told Brundage, who had a terribly unnerving experience driving alone along a lonely road in mid-August: Something is about midget for car. Then she saw a glowing object hovering right over her hood. the object remained in the sky, beginning slowly. Mrs. A. was a Brundage said the object seemed to be a gigantic version of a child's toy. It was about 25 wide as the mobile. After about two minutes, the object made a sort of "dipping" motion and swept over the trees to her left, out of sight. She saw then the ordinary little ground shapes she had seen all along that day. The battery in her car went dead a moment or two later, lasting only until the next day to be two minutes slow - indicating that it had stopped during the period of time the UFO was at close range. Mrs. Brundage was so frightened by the encounter that she has refused to drive alone over that stretch of road at night any more.
