The night of September 3, 1965, at about 1:30 a.m., several residents of Exeter, New Hampshire, observed a large object in the sky which appeared to be the size of an automobile. The object had a brilliant light and seemed to be hovering a few hundred feet above the ground. At one point it appeared to be only a few feet off the ground and then slowly ascended and moved away. After some investigation, the object was lost from sight.
