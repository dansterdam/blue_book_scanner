The image does not contain a photograph, it is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be an "Official U.S. Air Force UFO" form, with handwritten text responding to question 35 about information pertinent to the sighting.

The text states:
"The time the object was in sight was not necessarily the amount of time it was in possible view. I would estimate that it is spent, the object would have remained in sight about 60 to 90 minutes before losing it during the observation."
