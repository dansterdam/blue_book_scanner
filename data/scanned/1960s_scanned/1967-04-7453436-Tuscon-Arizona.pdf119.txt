I am a member of C.S.P.A.C.E (civilian saucer program, amateur astronomers club) and have witnessed many strange flying objects in the past. On this occasion, I was observing the sky using a 6-inch reflector telescope when I noticed a strange object in the sky. It appeared to be circular, or disc-shaped, with a metallic surface that reflected the sunlight. The object made no sound and moved at a high rate of speed before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view. The sighting lasted approximately 5 minutes.
