Dear sir: 
- ent about the matter on the 5th you mentioned the man that came in and talked to me said he had seen an unusual light in the sky. Well I saw that light too. It was a most unusual thing and I am quite sure that it was not an ordinary object like an aircraft or anything like that. I am quite certain that it was not. The light came down low and very near and then went up again and then disappeared. It happened very quickly, in just a matter of a few seconds. I was quite startled by it and watched it very closely. I am quite sure it was not an ordinary aircraft and I have seen a great many aircraft in my time. I am most certain it was something very unusual and out of the ordinary. I would be very interested to know if anyone else saw it and what they thought about it. I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know if there were any other reports of this unusual light. I am very much interested in this matter and would like to know more about it if possible. I hope you will be able to get some information on this for me. Thank you very much and I would greatly appreciate hearing from you.
Sincerely yours,
