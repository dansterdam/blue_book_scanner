AN ENCOUNTER WITH GOD AND THE UFOS

If you have worried that "God Is Dead" - Rejoice! For He lives and reigns and has power over all, as He promised! And this is my humble testimony to His Almighty power. I had started to write an expose of the UFOS which are surrounding the earth, and I kept careful notes of the things which I saw and experienced. Now, I am unable to do that precisely as I envisioned because God himself, enters into my experiences. This is therefore, become a proclamation of His everlasting Love such as seemed could be revealed in the year 1967. 

I have started to write about an adventure which began in February 1967 and essentially ended the first of September but the end is not yet as you will see. The incident, the understanding which came too swiftly as a child in kindergarten, I could not understand how the teacher could tell me that "God Is Love" and then shake with hysterical laughter or perhaps mere nervous excitement as Catholic priests or German soldier's laughed, when I was eight or nine and heard the Minister preach of Christ, then damn all Roman Catholics; or maybe this incident in Germany where I watched American servicemen accuse Catholic officers of being agents of the Church by throwing tomatoes and rotten fruit.
