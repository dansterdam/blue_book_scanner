WE SAW A LARGE. VLIKE. OBJECT APPEAR BRIEFLY THEN IT SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR. IT WAS ABOUT A TEL. SCOPE IN LENGTH ON A TRAJECTORY TO THE EAST. IT APPEARED IN SIZE BUT QUICKLY FADED OUT OF SIGHT. WHAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE ITS APPARENT SPEED WAS RAPID AND IT WOULD BE OF THE "BRIGHTER THAN THE STARS" HS THE WHOLE OBJECT TO BEHOLD AT IT OCCURRED. APPARENTLY IT WAS QUITE A DISTANCE AWAY. AT THE FIRST SIGHTING WE CAN ONLY DESCRIBE IT AS BEING LARGER THAN A STAR AND OF A MORE DEFINITE OUTLINE RATHER THAN JUST BEING ANOTHER STAR. IT APPEARED TO BE BRIGHT AND CLEAR, SORT OF SHINING RATHER THAN BEING ILLUMINATED LIKE SOME OF OUR MAN-MADE OBJECTS WHICH HAVE BEEN SEEN. IT APPEARED TO BE QUITE A DISTANCE AWAY. I HAVE FOUND, AFTER CHECKING CAREFULLY, THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH ANY SATELLITE OR AIRCRAFT THAT IS KNOWN TO US.
