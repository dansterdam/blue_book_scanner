Our sighting of an unidentified object took place on the 24th of December 1966, at approximately 7:15pm in Cheltenham, Maryland. We were returning from a Christmas party when we first noticed the object in the sky. It appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly and was a round or oval shape with a bluish-white light. At first we thought it might be an aircraft, but it made no sound and the light did not blink as an aircraft light would. It hovered for several minutes and then suddenly took off at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds. I was quite puzzled by this and wondered what it could have been. We did not report the incident at the time, but I am now doing so as I feel it may be of interest. I am aware that there have been many similar sightings in this area and I would be most interested to learn if there is any explanation for what we saw.
