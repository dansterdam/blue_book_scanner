TO: UFO Sighting (Santa Fe, Argentina)

1. Reference the attached letter from (redacted). The following information is provided to assist you in a reply to this report on the UFO sighting of (redacted) near Santa Fe, Argentina.

2. The sighting has been reported to us indirectly and therefore the information should be investigated due to the delay in receipt of the report. The object appeared to be small, and therefore a field investigation would be advisable.

3. It is not our desire or intent to expend or redirect your very limited investigative resources. However, we would appreciate any information you can provide concerning this report.

4. Our opinion, not for release, is that this case follows a pattern of sightings classified as "Insufficient Data" - that is, insufficient evidence, corroborating data, and follow-up investigation to support or refute the validity of the report. All such reports have failed to produce any evidence of their actual occurrence. The testimony and description gathered thus far, in our opinion, indicates possible distortion of basic facts or insufficient data to establish the reality of the occurrence. However, we cannot conclude with certainty that no unusual aerial phenomenon occurred. We recommend that you conduct a field investigation, if possible, to confirm or refute this report.
