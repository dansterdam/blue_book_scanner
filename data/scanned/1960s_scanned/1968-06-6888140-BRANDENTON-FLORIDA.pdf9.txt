The text in the document is as follows:

and warn, there was no moon. The object which I saw had me frightened, characteristics of an oval and luminescent on the tip appeared as sharp and seemed quite close, as then the object appears to have braked suddenly and then hovered only a short distance away. It surprised and alarmed me as much as it for as long as it was visible on the first experience.

On June 17, 1968 my friend and I observed another strange phenomena. We were on the first floor of our homes when we noticed a peculiar light, the size of which appeared to be the size of a car. At first, they thought it might be a plane or helicopter, but the object moved in a strange manner, neither up nor down, nor from side to side. It simply stood still. It then began to move slowly without any visible means of propulsion, We observed this "object" for 15 to 20 minutes. During this observation, the object changed colors from a brilliant white to a deep orange-red. It then returned to the brilliant white color. The object then simply vanished, there was no trail, no noise, nothing, it simply disappeared. I then called the police and reported the incident, but they were unable to explain what we had observed.
