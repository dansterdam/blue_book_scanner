Incident Report - Sighting

According to telephone conversation with your office, Ranger, Maine National Park Service, here is the report on the sighting as witnessed by me.

At a very clear night, about 10:30 P.M., in the vicinity of the Northeast Harbor, Maine, I was driving along a road when I noticed a very bright light, much brighter than a star, approaching from the northwest at a high rate of speed, estimated at over 1,000 miles per hour. The light was bluish-white in color, spherical in shape and about 2 feet in diameter. It passed overhead at an elevation of approximately 300 feet. When it reached a point directly overhead, the light suddenly went out and I saw nothing further. The whole sighting lasted less than 5 seconds. 

I reported this incident immediately to the nearest park ranger station. Several other people reportedly saw the same object at about the same time, from other locations in the area. I am quite certain it was not an aircraft, meteor, or any other known object. This sighting appears to be one of several which have been reported from this general vicinity on various occasions.

I trust this report will be of interest to you and your staff. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely yours,
(Signature)
