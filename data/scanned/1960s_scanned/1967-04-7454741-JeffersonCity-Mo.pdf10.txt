Enclosed is the tape recording of your conversation with the 17 Apr 67, Jefferson City, Missouri UFO sighting. We don't have any tape recordings, inasmuch as we have nothing to add, that can be of use in the speed of the recording. Therefore, we are returning the recording without taking a transcript.
