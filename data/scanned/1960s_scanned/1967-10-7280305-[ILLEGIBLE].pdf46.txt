The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing the position of an aircraft and the reliability of the observers.

THE POSITION OF ANY AIRCRAFT IN THE LOCAL AREA AND ITS REFERENCE TO THE POSITION OF A SIGHTING SUCH AS THIS COULD BE DETERMINED VISUALLY OR BY SIMPLY REFERRING TO THE AIRPORT SEARCH RADAR SCOPE WHICH CAN GIVE INFORMATION AS TO THE LOCATION OF ALL AIRCRAFT IN THE LOCAL AREA. IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THE CAUSE OF THE SIGHTING WAS OTHER THAN THAT OF THE AIRCRAFT, AS THE LOCAL MOVEMENT AND POSITION OF THE AIRCRAFT IS KNOWN. THE DURATION, MANEUVERABILITY AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT, AS WELL AS THE EXPERIENCE AND RELIABILITY OF THE OBSERVERS, IS CONCLUDED THAT A PHENOMENON OF SOME SORT WAS OBSERVED BUT THE LOGICAL CAUSE CANNOT BE DETERMINED.
