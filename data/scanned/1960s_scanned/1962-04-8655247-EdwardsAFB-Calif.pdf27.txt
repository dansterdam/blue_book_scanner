Courses At Successful
Naval schools must be approved by the
Superintendent of the Naval Academyy, for
periods of two years. The ASO, which has
been in operation for over 30 years, has
been approved by the Navy.
Graduates of the ASO course are eli-
gible for appointment as officers in the
Navy. It will be among the first
such Naval Reserve programs to continue in
operation after 30 June 1962.

Lt. Nikolai Graduates
305 With Distinction
Lieutenant Richard M. Nikolai, of
Coronado-on-the-Pacifict, recently completed
his training at the Advanced Strategic Mis-
sile Systems School, graduating with distinc-
tion from Squadron Officer School, Maxwell
AFB, Ala. Lt. Nikolai was one of the
top students in his class of more than 900
officers, who attended the 13-week course.
Lt. Nikolai, who was commissioned a
second lieutenant in August 1957, has
attended Air Command and Staff College as
well as Squadron Officer School in recent
years.
He holds a Bachelor's degree from
the University of Washington in 1957
and was assigned to the design and
analysis of the advanced strategic missile
systems after finishing his studies in Futuristic
Methods course.

Contract To Develop Deep
Space Tracking Ability
Announced By Air Force

The Air Force has announced a multi-
million dollar contract with the Philco
Corp oration of Ame rica, Radio-
Electronics-Television Manufacturers As-
sociation, Philadelphia, to develop a capa-
bility for deep space tracking. This effort
is part of the presently underway program
aimed at setting up an Advanced Space
Tracking Facility.
Besides a powerful telescope, the
equipment under this contract will in-
clude a large radio telescope and instru-
mentation to provide a capability for
precision tracking to a far greater range
than presently exists. The contract calls
for the development and installation of the
necessary equipment and the training of
personnel to operate the new facility.
This message and more: The remarkable
development of satellite tracking and con-
trol capabilities so vital to the national
defense are described. With accuracy as
high as can be achieved, electronically, then the
information gathered and the messages trans-
mitted to the earth from the satellite can then
be used for further improvement in the design
and development of future satellites.
However, this advanced capability cannot be
placed in the hands of unqualified personnel and
necessarily be restricted to earth.

Inventory Transfers Net
Millions For Taxpayers

This report of activities of the Defense
Supply Agency indicates the extent to which
millions of dollars in inventory values are
being transferred to appropriate Government
agencies and to private industry. Under this
recurrent process of inventory adjustments,
excess stocks from one service is another
service's deficit. This represents an
economy and a better utilization of
resources according to a report made to the
Defense Supply Agency by its Director of
Supply Operations.
A sample of how the "transfers"
were handled is noted. The Navy had a
quantity of turbine engines used in aircraft
which were not required. Through coordina-
tion with the Air Force, the entire quantity
could be absorbed. This prevented the
ultimate dis position of these items and
provided supplies which the Air Force had
indicated as a need.
This practice was described by
authorities for Defense as "one of the
advantages of having a central inventory
system." Under this system, the services
do not have to resort to sales or scrapping
excess items, but can keep them in the
Defense supply system for further use.

Education Pays
Col. D. Simmons, of ASD, a supervisor
assigned to Armament Munitions and
Electronics Division, attended the United
States Air Force English Test Center. Upon
the successful completion of the course of
studies, he was awarded a Master's degree.
This award of the advanced degree, under an
Air Force educational program for enlisted
and officer personnel, is indicative of the
many opportunities for education and train-
ing in the Armed Forces.
Some of the examples that further demon-
strate the Air Force interests and invest-
ments in the education of its personnel:
The U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology
located near Wright-Patterson AFB, provides
graduate degree programs in various techni-
cal fields.
The Air University at Maxwell AFB, Ala.,
furnishes non-technical graduate programs
in administration, management, and
International Affairs.
The Air Force has tuition payment programs
for officers and airmen taking college courses
at local institutions under their own time and
resources.

Rocket Society Speaker

Harry G. Bean, the 1956 President of the
American Rocket Society, recently addressed
the Northern Ohio National Meeting of the
Armed Forces Communications and Elec-
tronics Association. He spoke on the contribution
of this society to the advancement of rocketry,
and the technical problems it has tackled. He
pointed out that rockets already being flight-
tested are not only capable of orbiting a
satellite, but are also powerful enough to
send a manned spacecraft to the Moon.
Allen D. Schoenfeld, the current President
of the American Rocket Society, stated that
the steady progress being made by the
society will provide the technical advances
needed to achieve manned inter-planetary
flight in the near future, and support systems
for the over-all space program.
