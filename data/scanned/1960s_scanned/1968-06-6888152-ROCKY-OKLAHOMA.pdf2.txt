MEMO FOR THE RECORD 25 JUNE 1968

Subj: UFO Observation, 19 June 1968

Mr. [REDACTED] said that he really couldn't say too much since he didn't know what type of counter was being used but did say that concentrations of 100-10,000 disintegrations/min/sq. centimeter requires the use of a gas mask. He suggested that I contact the base Health Physics Officer or have local H. P. Officer measure with STAPLEX. Called [REDACTED] office and was referred to No. 76231 where he was at the time. Mr. [REDACTED] stated that without information such a background count and type of instrument (including Army Navy Portable Detector No.) he really couldn't say if the radiation was hazardous or not.

Suggested that I call the base/land State Health Physics Officer accompany and make measurements on count.
If that is impossible find out:
1. If instrument is properly calibrated.
2. If Capt. Leonard is familiar with the use of the instrument.
3. Type and make of instrument (including ANPDR #).
4. Background count.
5. If they are getting reading from
A. An object
B. General area
6. If object, take several readings at various distances from
object.
7. If area, take several measurements at various distances from
the area.
