After reading about sightings of unidentified objects in the sky in this area lately, I decided to report what I saw the other night. I have always been interested in this subject and what they could be, but never reported anything before. I saw a bright light in the sky which seemed to land in the field behind our house. I watched it for about 5 minutes and it appeared to be a glowing, oval-shaped object. It then rose up very slowly and flew off to the northwest at a high rate of speed. I could not make out any distinct shape or features, just a bright light. It did not make any sound that I could hear. I would like to know if anyone else in this area has reported seeing the same thing. I intend to watch more closely in the future if I should see anything again.
