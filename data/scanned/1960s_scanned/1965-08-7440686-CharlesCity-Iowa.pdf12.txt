Dear Mr. [redacted],
This is in reply to your report of your observation of an aerial object on the night of 21 August 1965.
The object which you observed has the characteristics of a star or planet hovering, but is the position or the reported object. The apparent motion and brightness can be attributed to atmospheric conditions at the time of the sighting.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. SPAULDING
