Dear Mr. ___

This letter is in reply to your recent letter inquiring about a flying object that you have been unable to identify.

Since the flight path is not that of your inquiry to the Office of Naval Research, Department of the Air Force, the Pentagon, Washington 25, D.C. is forwarded.

Sincerely yours,

Brooklyn 25, New York
