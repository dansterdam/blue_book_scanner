It seems dont recall in details of my age (13) you know what my family so please remember when I said it was 3.000 T. No cover on the object but saw short 1 flash of light and that was all I saw and the was something like 1 minute in duration and my family and I were on time. Nothing more I can say this object was reported in the papers as been sighted in other towns as well and Ive seen.
