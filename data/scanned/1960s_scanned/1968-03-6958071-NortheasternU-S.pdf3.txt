AT FIRST INVISIBLE, THEN I THINK GRADUALLY BECAME VISIBLE. VERY SLOW IN MOTION, HOVERING, JERKLY MOVEMENTS, VERY BRIGHT, WHITISH LIGHT, ALMOST LIKE SUNLIGHT. DID SOMETIMES BECOME MOMENTARILY INVISIBLE. VERY SMALL, AND FAR AWAY. SEEMED TO BE AT HIGH ALTITUDE. IMPRESSION OF UFO LIKE FORM, BUT NOT VERY CLEAR.
