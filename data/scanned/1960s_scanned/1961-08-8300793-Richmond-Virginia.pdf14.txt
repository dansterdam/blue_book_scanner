Jupiter, Saturn Shine in August

The planet Jupiter is the brightest object in the sky this month. Saturn is also a bright star-like object, according to James Sealey's reports.

The text in the document states:

"Jupiter, the brightest object in the sky this August, and Saturn, a brilliant star-like object, are both visible this month, James Sealey reports.

Jupiter is now the brightest object in the sky, even brighter than the planet Venus, and Saturn is also very bright, Sealey states.

Both planets are well placed for observation in the evening sky this month, with Jupiter reaching its highest point in the south around 10 p.m. and Saturn following about an hour later.

The two planets are in favorable position for observation in August, and their brightness makes them easy to locate, according to the report."
