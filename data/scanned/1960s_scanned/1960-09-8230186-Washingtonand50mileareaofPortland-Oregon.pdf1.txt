11. COMMENTS
Description is characteristic of a ballistic-type observation. Altitude, although given as 20-30 degrees, is estimated and location and time of the observation indicate a probable astronomical phenomena, possibly a meteor. However, the brevity of the observation and lack of details preclude a definitive conclusion that the object was a known stimulus. The case must be listed as Insufficient Data for Evaluation.
