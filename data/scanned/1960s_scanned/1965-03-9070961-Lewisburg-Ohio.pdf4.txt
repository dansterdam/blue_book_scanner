The image contains a document page from Project Blue Book that appears to be a questionnaire or report form. There is no photograph present in this image. 

The text in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
No - It simply faded very rapidly but then it reappeared.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?  
(Circle One):   Yes /  No  /  Don't know.  If you answered "YES", then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes / No  / Don't Know.  If you answered "YES", then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: No unusual sound, just red-orange glow.  
b. Color: Red-orange in color.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
About 10 times the size of match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protuberances, etc., and especially indicate trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
