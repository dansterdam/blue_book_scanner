The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely a page from an old UFO report.

The text in the document is as follows:

The following is a gist of my report made by McGinnis, night, the angle between my wife and me was 30° and appeared as the flat side of the object to the south in rither 5 or 10 seconds duration.

57° and corpulent. 
legs numb and paralyzed,
20 - 25 000 ft elevation.
29.00 High ( Fit 7 800 ft ) This was apparent.

The difference is to have the angle from the object to an apparent and more high altitude and was thought to be but one.

I hope this helps in determining what the document contains. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requests.
