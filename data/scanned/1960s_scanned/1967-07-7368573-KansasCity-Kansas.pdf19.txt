PREFACE

The following report was made to the proper authorities of the U.S. Air Force within minutes of the observation of the UFO and its final destruction on July 3, 1967.

Since then this report has been discussed with other interested persons and groups, such as Dr. Ed Condon, Col. Mercier, Dr. Allan Hynek.

I am hereby submitting this report to additional persons and groups to see if they have additional information and can vouch for its authenticity. I hope the U.S. Government will make an intensive full scale development program on these various devices if they don't Russian. A conscientious U.S. citizen has resulted in undue hardships and penalties because these people as they as openly misleading the American people.

I firmly believe we are far closer to the development of these unusual devices than is generally believed, and I have several ideas on this.

The U.F.O. sighted in this report exploded within sight of one of the largest and most important Air Force bases in the U.S.
