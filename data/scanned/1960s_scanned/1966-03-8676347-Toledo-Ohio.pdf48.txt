1. Attached are two preliminary reports of alleged UFO sightings, forwarded in accordance with AFR 200-2.
2. Also enclosed is a clipping from the local newspaper, containing an article on UFO interest in the local area.
3. I believe the newspaper article will help in part to explain the "sightings". There has been a normal amount of interest generated locally, since the recent "Michigan sightings". With more people "looking for UFOs", undoubtedly more "see" them.
4. I don't believe the two enclosed reports require any further follow-up action. One can be attributed to over-active imaginations, possibly aided by aircraft sightings on a cloudy night. The other could possibly be some sort of radio communication from a "ham" radio operator.
