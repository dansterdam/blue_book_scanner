CLIPPING FROM ORLANDO SENTINEL 10 MAY 1966

Everybody
But Police
Sees Lights

The blue green men are
back at it again.
Hundreds of Orlandoans
reported to police and the
sheriff's office that they
saw strange objects glowing over the Central Florida
landscape.

THE ORANGE COUNTY
Sheriff's Department dispatched a team to Colonial
High School after officers
reported the object (or objects) in this area. Witnesses
described the glowing, moving, unusual object.

The Sentinel received in
excess of 40 calls Reports
of sightings ranged from
lights seen in the Lee Park and the east end
of the county.

Most observers agreed it
was green, red, pink, white
or some other color, that it
was round, and that it moved
with great speed, changed
shape and that it zigged,
zagged, stopped, backed and
moved forward, up and
backed up or remained motionless while it was visible.
