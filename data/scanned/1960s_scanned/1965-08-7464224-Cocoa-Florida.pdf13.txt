Back.** ********** And I said: "Well, I wonder if it is the one I see in the flight." 
H: When you saw the stationary one, can you be sure it was the same thing you saw moving?
M: Yeah -- it was the same reflection of light. 
H: I see. It was different from a star.
M: Oh, definitely.
H: O.K. Now, this diamond formation - did you say it was nearly overhead?
M: I see. How far from overhead was it? Was it to the north, to the south, or --
M: It was directly - from where we were standing - ******** it was precisely directly overhead.
H: Directly overhead.
M: Yeah - I had to lean back with the binoculars and look up. And the one that was off - in the west - I leaned on a fellow's back smoke to keep it steady, you know. And it was casting off those lights - along with the diamond formation - the other one stayed white.
H: Let me ask you this: If you had held your hand outstretched, if you could have held it - excuse me just a second - there was an interruption - someone said there was another phone call but I'll get that later.
M: I'm getting hoarse. I got myself a strap through my throat coming in.
H: I think.
H: You shouldn't - you go on duty pretty soon, don't you?
M: Twelve o'clock.
H: You'd better go home.
