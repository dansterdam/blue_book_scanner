Text from the document:

US US, Air Force has come to light concerning an incident reported 6 April 1962, at 1400 hours, involving an unidentified aerial object observed at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The object was initially sighted at approximately 1400 hours by numerous observers, including several officers, airmen, and civilian personnel. The object, appearing to be a bright metallic sphere, was traveling at a high rate of speed and making a sizzling sound. It was observed by several persons over an approximate period of 15 minutes. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and was maneuvering in a northwesterly direction at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. It was observed to make a sudden stop, reverse its direction, and accelerate to a very high rate of speed as it disappeared from view. The craft then re-appeared in the same area several minutes later, repeating the same maneuvers. After these observations, it disappeared from sight and was not observed again. A number of personnel at the base made detailed reports of the incident. Project Mercury officials had studied the reports and had requested that the incident be thoroughly investigated by the Air Force. The reports were forwarded to the Director's office with recommendations for further action.
