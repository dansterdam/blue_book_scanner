THE OBJECT WITH THEM. THE MECHANIC WAS DRIVING A RED INTERNATIONAL PICK-UP TRUCK; NAME UNKNOWN, HAS A GARAGE ON NORTH SIDE OF HIGHWAY 66 IN GRANTS, NEW MEXICO. OBSERVER, WOODRUFF, APPEARED TO BE A VERY RELIABLE AND COMPETENT OBSERVER, WITH AVIATION EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING
HE COMMENTED THAT HIS FIRST THOUGHT ON THE RED LIGHT WAS THAT IT MIGHT BE A NAVIGATION LIGHT, BUT THAT IT DEFINITELY WAS NOT. FROM HIS FIRST POSITION HE WAS LOOKING DOWN TOWARD AN ELEVATED TERRAIN POSITION TOWARD HIGHWAY 66 WHEN HE SIGHTED THE OBJECT AT AN ESTIMATED 500 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. HE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY STRANGE THAT AN AIRCRAFT WOULD BE FLYING AT SUCH LOW ALTITUDE IN SUCH MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN IN A VALLEY. HE COMMENTED THAT ONE RADAR BASE WAS LOCATED VERY NEAR AT LAGUNA, AND ANOTHER AT THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE, BUT " DOUBTED THEY COULD PAINT THE OBJECT BECAUSE OF GROUND CLUTTER AND PERMANENT ECHOS ON THE SCOPE AT ALITUDE OF THE OBJECT". HE WAS VERY HESITANT ABOUT MAKING A REPORT AND DID NOT DO SO UNTIL THE MORNING OF APR 29 AT THE URGING OF, AND AFTER DISCUSSION WITH ANOTHER TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL, WITH REGARD TO NEWS PAPER ITEMS ON SIX OTHER REPORTS IN THE SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO AREA. BELIVE WITNESS TO BE COMPETENT, CREDIBLE, AND TRUTHFUL. REPORTED TO LUKE AFB, ARIZ.
