The text reads as follows:

The time was about 7:40, Thursday night. We were just getting off of church and school instructions. I turned North, as I turned I noticed that the sky was lit up to the northwest. I stopped and rolled down the window and looked up towards the sky. Then I saw the U.F.O. It was round and about fifty to seventy-five feet in diameter, and about ten to fifteen feet high, the bottom was curved. The sides were straight, but where the bottom touched the edges it was curved. 

The edge was lit all the way around. The bottom had a dome shaped object which was also lit up in white light. I turned around and started back to where I left rest the rest of the guys where. During the time I started back and the time that I got there, (about one-quarter mile) the white lights had gone off and the red lights came pointing to the object which now was at a distance of about a quarter-mile away. They jumped into their car. Five in the one car, drove off. We started after the object. We followed it for about three miles, till it had come out of sight. It did not go up but straight ahead and out of sight.

We stopped at the sign, we could still see about five ten miles ahead, we could tell that it stopped and came a little bit, but turned and went on.
