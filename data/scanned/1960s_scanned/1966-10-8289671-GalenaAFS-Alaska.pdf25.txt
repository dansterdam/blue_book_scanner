The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document reporting an unidentified aerial phenomenon observed on October 29th, 1966 near Garden City, Long Island, New York.

The text in the document is as follows:

Attention Project Blue Book
Gentlemen:
Reference is made to the glowing object sighted over Long Island on October 29th. I am a pilot and was enroute from Shannon, Ireland to New York International Airport. Perhaps this may interest you.
At approximately 2100Z,making good about 240 deg. True,at an altitude of 31,000 ft.we sighted an orange-colored glowing object about 20 deg.to our left. Visibility was good with sky conditions broken to scattered above and no undercast. It appeared to be far on the horizon and our intention was to continue on our course until the object came abeam of us which time we could investigate. However, at our speed of about 450 knots, as we continued to watch,it never did come abeam nor did its apparent motion relative to us diminish nor did it change its size position. At one time it disappeared,and at our navigation computation approach,there could have been eclipse or obscuration the glow seemed to break up into two parts. There was no definite shape to the glow and it was about the size of a star-diameter. It observed it for about 30 minutes at an altitude of 31,500 ft.
The above figures are approximate as I remember them; they were noted more accurately on my chart which has been filed with our operations office in Miami.If you desire more exact data,I can obtain it from the chart.
There were three other crew members besides myself that observed the glow and it was our final deduction that it was a reflected image of the moon,or of the actual sunset,due to refraction.

Very truly yours,
