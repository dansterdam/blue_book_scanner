14 January 1951

Dear Mr.

Your letter has brought an inquiry of an investigative nature, and we appreciate your contribution bringing this to our attention.

That letter was by-product in a case which we were conducting and is considered a working document, not a final report. For this reason we cannot release the complete contents to you at this time, as it would be premature and could divulge information which is still under study.

Sincerely,
