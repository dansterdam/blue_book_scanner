Did the object move in front of the thing at any time, particular a allowed? Don't know.

Tell in a few words the following things about this object:

- Color: Red, mostly red, I would say 10 to 15 with a few white lights.
- The match experiment: The match would have occurred about to 2 p.m.
- Draw a picture: That will show the shape of the object. I will draw it as I saw it. All I saw was lights.
