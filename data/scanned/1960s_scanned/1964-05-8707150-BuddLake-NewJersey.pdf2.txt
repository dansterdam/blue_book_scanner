Dear [redacted],

The Office of the President has asked the Air Force to report to you regarding your recent sighting of an unusual object in the sky over Budd Lake, New Jersey, on May 23rd and 24th.

The object you saw on both May 23rd and May 24th was ECHO-II, a satellite. This satellite was born of your ECHO I, which was launched on August 12, 1960. ECHO-II is a passive reflector satellite, 135 feet in diameter, which reflects radio signals back to earth. It is now orbiting the earth at an average altitude of 1,000 miles, moving southeasterly at a speed of 15,000 miles per hour.

We are including with this letter a brief summary of the technical data on ECHO-II, which have been obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. This data includes technical details about the satellite which have been the subject of several books pertinent to the subject.

Please let me know if you have any further questions regarding this matter.

Sincerely,
C. H. CARLSON
Colonel, USAF
Chief, Public Information Division
