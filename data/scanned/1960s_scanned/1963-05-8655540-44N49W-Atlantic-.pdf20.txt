Flying Saucer Scare in the Cape
Police called in

The Flying Saucer Review is grateful to Mr. Phillip J. Human for having drawn their attention to this interesting case.

On the night of April 24, 1963, a number of persons in Boksburg, a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa, reported seeing a strange lighted object in the sky. The sightings began around 9:15 p.m. and continued until after midnight. The object was described as a large, brightly lighted object which seemed to hover over the town for a considerable time. It was also reported to have changed shape and color during the observations. The Police were called in to investigate the matter, and, according to the report, they did so with obvious difficulty in that the object refused to be detected by them. The reports continued for several days, and much public excitement and speculation was aroused over the incident.
