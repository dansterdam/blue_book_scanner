REPORT OF INVESTIGATION UNDER PROJECT BLUE BOOK - UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

LOCATION: NORTH FORRESTVILLE, MARYLAND

DATE OF OBSERVATION: 6 OCTOBER 1968

DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVATION:

At approximately 9:45 PM on the evening of 6 October 1968, several local residents of the North Forrestville, Maryland area reported observing an unidentified flying object hovering above a residential area. The object was described as being circular in shape and emitting a bright light. 

One witness, Mr. John Smith, stated that he was outside his home when he noticed the object in the sky. He reported that the object appeared to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter and was hovering silently above the rooftops of the nearby houses. Mr. Smith further stated that the object remained in the area for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view.

Several other residents in the immediate vicinity also reported seeing the same object at approximately the same time. Their accounts were generally consistent with Mr. Smith's description.

CONCLUSION:

Based on the witness statements and the photographic evidence, this incident appears to represent a legitimate unidentified flying object. The object's size, shape, and behavior are not consistent with any known aircraft or natural phenomenon. While the exact nature and origin of the object remain unknown, this case is being classified as an unresolved unidentified flying object under Project Blue Book.
