15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes / (No) / Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes / (No) / Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of.
17. Tell in a few words, the following things about the object: a. Sound None. b. Color Metallic, & green. (Did not seem to be an aircraft.)
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how many times the object's angular size is the same as the match stick. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Don't know.

Do not wish to sketch.
