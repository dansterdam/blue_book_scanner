There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document containing text. I will now proceed to produce an OCR output of the text found in the document.

Friday March 29, 1967
At 7:15 P.M. a man reported that while he was driving on route 303 near Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, he observed a light in the sky that was first about the size of a dime at arm's length, then grew rapidly larger, about 40 to 45 feet in diameter. He said it remained stationary for 2 minutes, then started to oscillate back and forth, and finally remained stationary again. It made no sound. He had time to stop his car and get a good look at it. This was described as a disk-shaped object with a row of lights around the perimeter. It finally disappeared behind some trees. The man claimed to be a highly responsible person, and gave the writer the impression of credibility. This was thought to be a valid sighting, although unfortunately, no photographs were obtained. This incident occurred at the time of the sighting.
