SAUCER LANDING IN AUSTRALIA: There were reports of a saucer landing outside a hotel on the night of May 23rd. One of the men, named C. W. Tilse, was drawn to the scene by the noise. He observed the saucer which was about 30 feet in diameter and was hovering about 30 feet above the ground. The flying machine looked like an upturned saucer with the top part being just above the horizon. Spotlights were around the main body of the machine, between the base and the top. It made no sound, as is usual. When it left, it did so at very high speed. In a nearby town, witnesses also stated that they had observed the object lift off from the ground, and searched the area with flashlights. There were marks in the ground, but no other physical evidence. The incident has been reported to the Australian Air Force, but so far they have found no such physical evidence to substantiate the story.
