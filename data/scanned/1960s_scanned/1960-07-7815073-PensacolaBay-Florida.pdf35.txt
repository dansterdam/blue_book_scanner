Proposed Reply to letter from Mrs. 28 November 1966

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

Please excuse the delay in answering your letter of 28 November in which you requested information on unidentified flying objects. 

A check of the case files at Wright-Patterson AFB reveals that no UFO sightings were reported to the Air Force on 4 July 1961 from the state of Massachusetts.
