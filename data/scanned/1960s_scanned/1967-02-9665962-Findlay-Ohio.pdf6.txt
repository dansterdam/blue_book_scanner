The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a diagram and text. The diagram appears to be a compass rose, showing different directions and angles. The text asks the viewer to imagine a sighting and draw how the object or objects moved, and to indicate the direction they were traveling.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" the course (direction) you first saw the object. Place on "B" the highest altitude reached by the object. Place on "C" the same course (direction) you last saw the object. Place on "D" the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" the beginning of the path, or "B" is the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
