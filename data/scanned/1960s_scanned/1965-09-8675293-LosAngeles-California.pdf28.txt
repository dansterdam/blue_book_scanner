Mrs G**** commented that her husband thinks this is a stupid and ridiculous affair and unidentified objects are generally caused by natural sources and people think they could possibly be controlled, and sometimes even controlled, but they weren't. She said it seems to be a similar thing at Vancouver. 

Mrs ****** said she had waited until around 3:22 pm/10 Sept 67 to see if she could find anything in the papers.

Call received by Mrs. Hofseommer.
