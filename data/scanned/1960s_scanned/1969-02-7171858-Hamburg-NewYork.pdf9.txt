Dear Mr. [redacted],
This replies to your letter postmarked December 14, 1968, in which you included some photographic prints.
In order for us to evaluate a photograph, we must have the original negative or original polaroid print. If you can send them, the following information will also be needed:
Type and make of camera
Types, focal length, and make of lens
Shutter speed used
Lens opening used; that is, "f" stop
Filter used, if any
Was tripod or solid stand used
Was camera pointed with relation to the ground: North, South, East, West, etc.
If all of the above information is not available, minimum requirements are type of camera, and smallest and largest "f" stops and shutter speed readings of the camera.
The prints you sent us are enclosed.
Sincerely,
JAMES H. AIKMAN
