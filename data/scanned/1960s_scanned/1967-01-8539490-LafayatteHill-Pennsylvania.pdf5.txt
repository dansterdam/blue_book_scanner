COMMANDING OFFICER

WILLOW GROVE, PENNA.
U.F.O. - SIGHTED JAN. 18 AND FEB. 3, 1967
DEAR SIR:
WHILE I WAS IN OUR REAR YARD BETWEEN 6:45 AND 7:00 P.M., JANUARY 18TH, I SAW AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WHICH CAME FROM THE SOUTHEAST AND SEEMED TO BE A ROUND LIGHT. IT WAS BLUISH-WHITE IN COLOR AND IT SEEMED TO BE AS LARGE AS AND MOVED ALONG JUST SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE MOON.
AFTER I RUSHED INSIDE TO GET MY CAMERA, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME SATELLITE PASSING OVERHEAD, I COULD NOT FIND IT. IT MUST HAVE PASSED ALONG TO THE MOON AS IT WENT PAST. BUT WHEN I CAME BACK OUT I COULD NOT SEE IT.
THERE WAS A STEADY LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO HOVER FOR A FEW MINUTES. I GRABBED MY BINOCULARS AND FOCUSED ON THE OBJECT BETWEEN THE MOON AND STARS (WHICH WERE OBSCURED BY THE BRIGHT OBJECT). I FOLLOWED IT FOR ABOUT A MINUTE AND IT THEN SEEMED TO GO BEHIND SOME TREES. LOOKING AT IT THROUGH MY BINOCULARS, I SAW THAT THE OBJECT WAS NOT A STAR BECAUSE IT WAS LARGER AND MOVED SO SLOWLY.
THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE LIT OR HAZY-LIGHTED BY SOME UNEXPLAINED LIGHT SOURCE OF ITS OWN. ITS FORWARD MOTION DID NOT APPEAR JERKY, BUT WAS STEADY AS IT MOVED. IT WAS FOLLOWING AN ARCHED COURSE AND SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING WHEN I FIRST SAW IT. IT MOVED IN RELATION TO THE STARS AND MOON. IT THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE TREES BUT REAPPEARED ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION. AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES IT DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY. THIS SAME OBJECT WAS SIGHTED AGAIN ON FEBRUARY 3RD. IT WAS IN VIEW FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES AND SEEMED TO BE MOVING TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST. IT APPEARED AND REAPPEARED FROM BEHIND TREES SEVERAL TIMES. 
MY WIFE AND FRIENDS ALSO SAW AN UNUSUAL OBJECT ON FEBRUARY 3RD. IT SEEMED TO HAVE A RED AND GREEN LIGHT AND WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR 45 MINUTES. WE WATCHED IT TO SEE IF IT WAS A STAR OR PLANET WE HAD NOT NOTICED BEFORE, BUT IT DID NOT REMAIN IN A FIXED POSITION LIKE A STAR OR PLANET. IT SEEMED TO BE MANEUVERING, AND AT TIMES HOVERED IN ONE SPOT.
I AM VERY INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THESE OBJECTS. APPROPRIATE NAVY OFFICIALS MAY WANT TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER.
