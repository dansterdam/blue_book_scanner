Historical Sightings of Aerial Phenomena
Prior to the so-called "modern era" (i.e., post-1947) of UFO activity, unexplained flying objects were reported less frequently. Peaks of activity are discernible in the 1882-1886 period, as well as in 1897, 1906 and 1909 (see Figure 2). Written sources, ranging from ancient manuscripts to noted newspapers tell of pre-twentieth century UFO sightings; Jacques Vallee, author of Anatomy of a Phenomenon, has assembled a file of more than 300 such reports for that period.
After 1800, sightings became more numerous and were better documented, both in the public and professional press. The explanations of such phenomena involved much conjecture, but observers increasingly sought rational criteria against which to test observations.
The great season of "western civilization is that such a relation, between natural phenomena, cannot be adequately understood on the basis of introspection, speculation or superstition, but requires investigation. The methods and techniques of investigation are what we mean by science.
Identification of Flying Objects (versus UFOs)
To evaluate UFO sightings, the Air Force has established categories of identification, based upon previous experience that usually permits conversion of an unidentified flying object to an identifiable one:
Aircraft -- evaluations are made on the basis of description and flight characteristics. Essential performance elements are delineated for conventional, jet, photo, and advertising aircraft, helicopters, and refueling missions.
