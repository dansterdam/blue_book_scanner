The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten page from a Project Blue Book report, describing a case that occurred on 4 Sep 64 in the Sacto (Sacramento) Area, California. The text indicates that the case included a taped recording and a physical specimen, both of which are described as being in a separate folder.
