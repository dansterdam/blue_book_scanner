TIME: 3:00 TO 3:15. TIME OF PHENOMENON: 15 MINUTES.
5:00 TO 5:10 P.M. I OBTAINED THE SAME OBJECT AGAIN THE SAME TIME.
AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME, I WAS WATCHING THE ROAD AHEAD OF 1 DATE 3-20-66. FIRST WHAT I WAS HEADING SOUTH ON 1-35 TOWARD WICHITA KANSAS. 
IT SEEMED TO BE VERY CLEAR NIGHT." I SAW THE STARS AND PARTICULARLY I LIKE TO OBSERVE THEM 5: 00 TO 3:01 A BRIGHT OBJECT DEVELOPED IN ABOUT 3 OR 4 MINUTES, APPEARED INTENSELY BRIGHT AND ABOUT 15 SECONDS THEN BECAME MORE INTENSE IN LIGHT AND SUDDENLY BECAME VERY MUCH BRIGHTER.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A FALLING STAR, AS I HAVE OBSERVED, THEY WHILE SOME SORT OF TRAIL PLUS LOOSE INTENSITY FALLA WAY TO PHENOMENON BECOME SO INTENSE TO SOUTH TOWARD NORTH THEN AS CONTRACT TO 8-10 MILES IT WAS APPROX WIDTH OF TAKE, SOME LIKE 8 MILES.   IT TAPPER IN INTENSITY AND SUDDENLY FLASHED A BRILLIANT WHITE INTENSE COLORS FROM WHITE "INTENSE" COLORS TO BLUE, TO LIGHT GREEN, TO RED ORANGE, BACK TO WHITE. THEN AS I CONTINUED FLASHED THE COLORS IN RAPID SUCCESSION, A DECREASE IN SIZE,
THEN IT WAS AS BLACK AS THOUGH NOTHING WAS THERE. IN OTHER WORDS, IF DISAPPEAR IN OTHER WORDS, IT WAS WITH COLORED WITH AURAL IT'S GOING THROUGH THESE COLORS AND SOME FORM.
