The text on the page is as follows:

ADVERTISING AIRCRAFT
Fall basically into two types:
a) Those targets or banners of some sort visible during daylight hours. Those are not usually misinterpreted unless the aircraft remains as a result for the observer to see only outlines and not details of the plane and sign being towed. Frequently reports are accompanied by drawings or photos assumed to be a part of the object viewed and generally marked by maneuvers. Frequently loud speakers are utilized but when heard the A/C should be within range identification as a known object. Local investigators can check for these aircraft since FAA regulations require that a permanent record be obtained for those flights.
b) Electrical lighted signs - Same essential characteristics except that they are usually viewed at night. On occasions there signs have been regarded as windows of a much larger craft. Flights again are relatively slow and maneuvering back and forth in one area is characteristic of the flight. An aircraft usually operates in an area for more than one day and can be viewed on successive nights, weather permitting.
HELICOPTERS
Motion slow. Flight may or may not include hovering. Should be far enough away from the observer that positive identification cannot be made during the day. May be reported as a black speck moving back and forth, up and down, etc. During the night when effect can be obtained from the red rotating beacon flashing through the canopy. Again motion will be erratic if the flight includes hovering. Positive identification usually simple to obtain by checking the flight schedules of military and civilian helicopters in the area.
