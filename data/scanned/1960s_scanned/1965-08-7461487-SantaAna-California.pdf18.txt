that the assertions in its statements were due to both or
the following reasons:

a. The Marine Corps investigation was generally cursory while this investigation focused on collecting considerable information and data after the incident. 

b. That it was a genuine attempt by the officers of the detachment to provide as much informa-
tion as possible in the absence of any data on which to evaluate a satisfactory number of specific details which had been observed some months previously.
It is considered probable that although the witness was quite articulate in his statements, his observations did Â·not warrant the conclusions which are discussed in great detail. In other words, the conclusions put forth by all of the people who have been involved with this matter as to the possible nature of the detachment's encounter do not appear to be in consonance with his actual observations which were of a limited nature.

Prior to the contact with the Senior SACTO, the investigators had been instructed not to issue a final opinion,  since the details covering this incident were still under investigation. Later on, however, I noted that a minor was used by stating that he had personally interviewed the witness, and that he had been quite successful in eliciting additional pertinent details from the witness - this cannot be supported, since no one other than this investigator had. actually made contact with the witness, and it is doubtful whether any additional investigating or inquiry or acting as though he had been caught in any inconsistencies occurred.

a. That this was quite interesting, since a man from North American Aviation Missile Division (who had spoken as a controller on the photography) had called them to say that this is was only about four feet in diameter.
