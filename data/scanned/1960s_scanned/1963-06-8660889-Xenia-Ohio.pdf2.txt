The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved shape in the sky above the horizon, with the instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate where the object was first seen, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it.

The second sketch shows a broader landscape view, with instructions to place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and to refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the drawing.
