WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP 20 FEET AWAY. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD. THIS GIVES A GOOD ESTIMATE OF THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE OBJECT APPEARS TO BE COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD, THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD. 
(PLEASE PLACE PHOTOGRAPH OF SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT ABOUT 50 FT. IN DIAMETER)
