The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document discussing an observation of a U.F.O. (Unidentified Flying Object) on a particular night.

to inquirer name recently published this
my first observation of a u.f.o.
at 1:30 AM on the morning
of the 8th day of july. visibility was 
what was full of stars and the moon appeared
as a sloped crescent, the object was located
in a point tn my southwest, a distance of 
perhaps a fourth of the way from the southwest to
the zenith. It became visible on its southward
movement at the periphery of my vision, the
exhaust was orange. Its exhaust was exactly
in the center, there was steady light and no
flashing. The exhaust was so compact that it
appeared to be a solid well shot through with dark specks running 
the entire length. It could not make out the outline bodily of the craft which moved
the stars as it passed. There were no ible in the dark body of the craft.
what I was able to observe first the exhaust was very compact, completely filling
the trail behind the craft as it moved southward. There was nothing to indicate the
nature of the craft. They should be noted.
