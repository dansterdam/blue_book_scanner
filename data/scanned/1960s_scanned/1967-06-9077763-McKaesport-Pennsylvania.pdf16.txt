Produced text from the image:

Baddecerall of ours 
a very bright light. Appeared to be a large object which
was hovering . Very silhueeted. Could not determine any
details , but seemed to me that this object was metal or have
a metal body and was motionless. I watched it for a few minutes.
It then seem to go behind a hill and disappear. I was amazed
and really don't know what to say about it. I thought that I
would report this to some local authorities. But I didn't know
who to contact. It was very unusual and don't know if there
are any explanation for this.
