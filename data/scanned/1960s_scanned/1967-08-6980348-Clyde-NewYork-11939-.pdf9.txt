CLYDE, NEW YORK 11939
AUGUST 6, 1967 
CASE 8-80348
SIGHTING REPORT

DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
On August 6, 1967, at approximately 8:30 p.m., the witness, who wishes to remain anonymous, reported seeing three unidentified flying objects over Clyde, New York. The objects were observed for approximately 5 minutes and appeared to be hovering in the sky. The witness described the objects as circular in shape, approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and emitting a white light. No sound was heard from the objects. The witness reported the sighting to the local police department, who in turn notified the Air Force.

INVESTIGATION:
The Air Force conducted an investigation into the reported sighting. Interviews were conducted with the witness, and the local police department provided their observations. No physical evidence was obtained, and no other witnesses were identified. The investigation concluded that the objects observed were likely conventional aircraft, possibly reflecting light in an unusual manner.

CONCLUSION:
Based on the available information, the Air Force was unable to determine the exact nature of the objects observed. The sighting was classified as "unidentified" due to the lack of conclusive evidence. The witness's report was added to the Project Blue Book files for further analysis and potential future investigation.
