TEXT OUTPUT:

Dear Sir: This report is being submitted by ******** regarding an unidentified flying object sighted near Bourbon, Missouri on January 6, 1968 at approximately 7:45 PM. The report is as follows:

My wife and I were returning home at approximately 7:45 PM on January 6, 1968. As we drove along Highway 185, just south of Bourbon, Missouri, we observed a bright light in the sky moving rapidly in a northerly direction. The light appeared to be about 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon. My wife and I watched this light for approximately 2 to 3 minutes as it moved across the sky at a high rate of speed. At one point, the light made a sharp turn to the west and continued on in that direction until it disappeared from our view. The light appeared to be considerably larger than a star and had a bright white glow to it. There was no trail or exhaust of any kind visible. The night was clear and there was no cloud cover. This was the only object we observed in the sky at that time.

To my knowledge, the object sighted was not an aircraft, satellite, or any other known aerial vehicle. The size, speed, and maneuverability of the object were quite unusual and do not correspond to any conventional aircraft. I am submitting this report in the hope that it may be of some value to your investigation of unidentified flying objects. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
[redacted]
