The image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it shows diagrams and handwritten text on a page from an old UFO report document.

The text in the document reads:

Dear Sirs,
My brother and I were down at a near hog farm watching the night sky. We saw a bright light come shooting down over the house, it came down very close to the ground, and it cut to my brother, he was very surprised. It was 5:00 pm, Jan 14th, 1963. The saucer kept rolling and with every roll it would change colors. The flying saucer would only turn two colors, red and white.
