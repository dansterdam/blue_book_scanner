The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, with some handwritten notes or sketches. The handwritten text includes the words "Horizon" and "?" but does not provide any additional context about the contents of the document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can output the following text found in the document:

Horizon

?
