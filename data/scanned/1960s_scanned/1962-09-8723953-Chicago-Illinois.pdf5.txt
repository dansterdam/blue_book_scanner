October 13, 1962

Dear Sirs:

On the night of September 13th, 1962, I was doing my homework for school when I happened to glance out of the window and saw a strange object in the sky. It was hovering about 100 feet from the ground and seemed to be slightly oval in shape and was glowing a yellowish-white color. The object remained stationary for several minutes and then suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. I was quite startled by what I saw and called my parents to come and look, but by the time they arrived the object had already gone. I have thought a lot about this incident and wonder if you might be able to provide me with any information about what I saw. It was unlike anything I have ever seen before in the sky. Any help or advice you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

Yours truly,
