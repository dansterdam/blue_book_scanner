Dear [redacted],

Please excuse the delay in replying to your letter of 25 April 1966. Your photo camera failed analysis personally, here at Wright-Patterson AFB. Their only comment was that there was no discernible object that could be identified on the photograph and that the light colored areas on the photograph could have been caused by sun flare.

Since you stated in your letter that we may keep the photo, we are placing it in the case files with your report. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

VICTOR GUTTANELLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
