SAUCER FLAP AROUND ALBANY - NEW YORK - At about 8 a.m. on August 19th, a man who elected to remain anonymous is driving his car along Highway 91. While driving, he observed a "saucer-shaped" object pass slowly in front of his car. The object passed overhead but close enough for him to make out details of the object. The object had a shiny top and a dark opaque bottom and seemed to be rotating. The object then swung through a cut in the trees before disappearing. The object was under 100 feet in altitude and about 25-30 feet in diameter. Another witness, a fisherman in nearby Castleton, N.Y., who was completely unaware of the other incident, reported seeing the same object.
