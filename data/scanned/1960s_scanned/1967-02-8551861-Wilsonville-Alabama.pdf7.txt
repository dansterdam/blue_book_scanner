Sighted as about square - west maybe north of west. Saw 2 lights. Blinking strange. 13 minutes or 15 minutes. Left to right movement 30 seconds to a minute. About 25 to 30 seconds. When they got in the west it went down to east like a plane, but brighter and larger. It was about 50 feet off the ground. Husband called his friends. They were about 5 miles away from Wilsonville, Alabama. They saw the object came out of the east, passed overhead and went into the west. It was a little cloudy but they could see it. They were watching it for about 13 to 15 minutes.
