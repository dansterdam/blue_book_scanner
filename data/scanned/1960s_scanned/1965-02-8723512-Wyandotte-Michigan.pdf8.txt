Dear Sir
Our report here in Wyandotte, Michigan is about a strange incident which occurred near our home. At approximately 10:45 PM on February 5, 1965, my wife and I were in our home when we noticed a bright light in the sky. We went outside and observed a large, bright object, which appeared to be hovering approximately 100 to 150 feet above the ground. The object was roughly oval-shaped and seemed to be emitting a pulsating glow. It remained in the same general area for several minutes before slowly moving away and disappearing from our view. We have no idea what this object was, but it was certainly unlike anything we had ever seen before. Please let me know if you need any additional information.
Sincerely,
[redacted]
