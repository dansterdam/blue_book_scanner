Proposed reply to UFO report from March 30, 1967

Dear [redacted],

This replies to your recent correspondence regarding your unidentified observation on March 30, 1967.

Detailed investigation revealed that you probably saw the chemical clouds mentioned in your completed questionnaire. A rocket fired from the Wallops Island, Virginia, station of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at approximately 1900 EST, March 30, 1967, released tri-ethyl borane and barium into the atmosphere. This caused the clouds to become various colors, but eventually they turned white and dissipated. The clouds may extend across the sky for several hundred miles and can be visible for thirty minutes to one hour.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

[redacted]
