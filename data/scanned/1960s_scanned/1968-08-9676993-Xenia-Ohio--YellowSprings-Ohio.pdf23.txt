Dear Colonel:

In case you have not seen it, I enclose a xerox copy of page 30 from the Flying Saucer Review, September/October 1968. I am honored to have my name so closely linked with yours. This is a criticism from an author that renders it somewhat the opposite of Lt. Col. Quintanilla's intent, I am afraid.

I have only one minor point to add to my previous discussion of the Yellow Springs case. The odor was said to be something like that of a gasoline or other petroleum product. What about engine's car? I think that the question of odor could have been disposed of quickly, by a few apt questions.

One further point. The map shows some turns of the road. But it does not disclose whether the road was absolutely straight or whether it may have been winding. In the apparent maneuvers of the UFO, this would have been a significant fact, had it been determined.

Incidentally, what other sort of answer could Hynek have expected from his investigation, rather than a classification of Faith, since the witnesses allegedly had such close contact with the object, and saw it so frequently? He should have drawn some sort of answer then. The answer might have been very different.
