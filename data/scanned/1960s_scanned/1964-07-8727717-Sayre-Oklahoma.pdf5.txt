Transcription of text from the document:

August 3, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

1964-1/3 is in reply to your letter of July 23, 1964, in which you reported sighting an unidentified flying object.

You were undoubtedly witnessing the passage of some natural object, such as a meteor, satellite, or aircraft, on the morning of July 23rd. The above-the-horizon, moving northeast-ward object which you observed is a normal phenomenon and would be consistent with your description.

Because of atmospheric conditions, the visibility may have appeared to you to be breaking up. This is merely an optical illusion.

Sincerely,

HAMPTON M. JACOBS
