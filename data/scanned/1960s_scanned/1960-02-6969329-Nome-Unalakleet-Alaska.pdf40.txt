The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I have produced the following text found in the document:

The behavior of the unidentified object was reported to the Alaskan Air Command through civilian sources with the reports on the behavior of the object varying from high and fast to low and slow.
