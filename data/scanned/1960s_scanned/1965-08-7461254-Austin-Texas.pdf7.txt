I SIGHTED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES BEGINNING ABOUT 8 P.M. OVER SOUTHEAST AUSTIN. IT WAS A RECTANGULAR OR SQUARE-SHAPED OBJECT WITH A BRIGHT GLOW EMANATING FROM IT. IT HOVERED IN ONE POSITION FOR SEVERAL MINUTES THEN SLOWLY MOVED OFF IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. I HAVE OBSERVED OTHER OBJECTS IN THE SKY WHICH I CONSIDERED TO BE UNUSUAL, BUT THIS WAS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND CLOSE-UP SIGHTING I HAVE HAD.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? AUGUST 15, ARMED FORCES
