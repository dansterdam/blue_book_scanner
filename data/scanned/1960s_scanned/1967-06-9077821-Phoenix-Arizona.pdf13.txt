The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"IT WAS GOING ALMOST STRAIGHT ABOVE ME
IT APPEARED.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
IT JUST VANISHED AFTER IT WENT ON AND OFF.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING?"
