REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH 
8 OCTOBER 1961

NARRATIVE: 
On 8 October 1961, at approximately 7:00 PM, MST, eye-witness reports were received from several independent sources of a bright, blinking light observed in the sky over Salt Lake City, Utah.

The object was described as a bright, white light which appeared to be pulsating or blinking at irregular intervals. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes before disappearing from view.

An investigation was immediately initiated by this office. Inquiries were made with the FAA, Hill AFB, and other local agencies, but no positive identification of the object was made.

Photographic evidence was obtained, but analysis of the developed film revealed no conclusive identification of the reported object.

This case is being filed as an UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, pending any further information which may assist in the identification of the reported phenomenon.
