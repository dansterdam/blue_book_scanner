WPAPO (---) (Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433)
J.F. APRIL 1955
New Lebanon, Ohio
Dear Sir,
The object that was submitted to the Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio was tested at the Air Force Materials Laboratory and determined to be of American origin. This confirms that the object was of American origin and does not represent evidence of a foreign space object. The saucer-shaped object was "unidentified" and could not be readily identified with any known aircraft or spacecraft.
We appreciate your patriotic duty as an American citizen in submitting this object to the Air Force for analysis.
Sincerely,
HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.
Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
