OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

OCTOBER 3, 1957

Dear [redacted],

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO). 

While detailed analyses, angular velocities, or weather information may be available to a scientific investigator, we are unable to provide a scientific investigation. Had you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
