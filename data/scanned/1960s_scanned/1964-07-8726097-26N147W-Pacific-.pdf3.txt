Captain H. Henry, Case File 19614 
Place: 26°47' N, 147°00' W, Pacific
Date: June 17, 1964

My wife, two children, and I were vacationing about 250 miles off the coast of Honolulu when I witnessed a strange object in the sky. The object appeared to be about the size of a large commercial jetliner, and it was moving at a very high rate of speed. It was completely silent and did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion.

The object was initially spotted by my wife, who alerted me to its presence. I observed it for about 20 minutes as it moved across the sky. It suddenly made a sharp turn and disappeared from sight. This maneuver was entirely different from the flight of any aircraft I am familiar with.

I thought I could distinguish in each object a sort of connecting link between them - that is, they seemed to be held together somehow. The objects were moving at tremendous speed and the time they were in sight was very brief.

I am convinced that what I saw was not a conventional aircraft. The performance and behavior of the object was entirely different from the flights of the five aircraft that were also visible in the sky at the time.

I am confident that this was not a hoax or a misidentification of a known object. The object was real, and its behavior was unlike anything I have ever witnessed before.
