Dear Sir

I am mailing this report as a follow-up on the object sighted on the evening of July 8, 1964 in the Cleveland, Ohio area. As stated in my initial report, I was driving home from work when I observed an unusual object in the sky. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was giving off a bright, pulsating light. It was hovering in the sky and then suddenly accelerated and moved out of sight rapidly. 

I am unable to provide any additional details about the size, altitude, or speed of the object as I was rather shaken by the experience and did not have the opportunity to closely observe it. However, I can confirm that what I witnessed was unlike any conventional aircraft I have seen before. I hope this additional information is helpful for your investigation. Please let me know if you require any further details from me.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
