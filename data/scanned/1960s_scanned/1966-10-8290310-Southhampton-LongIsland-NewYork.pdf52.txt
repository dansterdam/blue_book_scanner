SAUCERS OR SORCERY? IT'S SIRIUS BUSINESS
Residents of the Montauk Bay - Napeague area of Long Island report an extraordinary event occurred in their vicinity on the night of September 4th. According to three witnesses, a strange phenomenon was observed in the sky over Napeague Harbor. The witnesses stated that a bright light, which they estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter, appeared low on the horizon and gradually increased in size and intensity until it seemed to fill half the sky. The light remained stationary for several minutes, then abruptly disappeared.
An investigation of the phenomenon was undertaken by the Suffolk County Police Department, but no satisfactory explanation has been offered. The light was not identified as an aircraft, and the witnesses apparently were not hallucinating. One theory advanced is that the light may have been connected in some way with the star Sirius, which was near the horizon at the time of the sighting. Sirius, the "Dog Star", has long been associated with strange and unexplained happenings. Could it be that the Napeague Harbor sighting represents another facet of the Sirius mystery?
