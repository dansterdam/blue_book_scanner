There does not appear to be any photograph in this image. The image shows a page of text from what seems to be a document related to Project Blue Book, a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text reads as follows:

Mrs. was again insistant upon the sights and the fact that there were only two lights. I tried to get her to put her hand at arm's length to see if she could have covered the objects with it. She insisted that the objects she saw were much larger than that.

After the car stopped, the corner at C, the lights seemed to go directly inward. They switched them through the car and the car was again toward the lights.  Could make out a dim yellow light immediately behind the two which she ventured might have been some sort of cabin light. 

Mrs. stated that the lights seemed to be going in a direction, the car stopped at P. She said she continued to see it through the car's rear window even after they left point that counted as the extra lights.

the drawing of the object as it appeared after these points is reproduced below:

Mrs. stated that the flight of the sighting was a wave motion, rising and falling, from the ground, and the only explanation or phenomenon was some sort of extraterrestrial craft. She stated
always has been a little skeptical before, but she also admitted that on occasion several of us excited to have seen a "flying saucer"
dawn one morning. (Counts like Venus)

but she seemed somewhat uncertain about the size and shape of the objects where the sighting was made.
