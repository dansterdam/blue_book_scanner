Text from the document:

Pilot chases 50-feet saucer
Soutley by plane... Pilot of a TWA Airlines flight that left Las Vegas at 8:22 pm on 29 September 1961 saw a saucer 50-feet in diameter at an altitude of about 3,000 feet. The pilot gave chase, but the saucer accelerated and disappeared in a few seconds. The object was bright white with a rim of blue lights around it, and it gave off a halo. It was seen through the cockpit window by the pilot and co-pilot. It was first observed over Utah Central Airport, southwest of Salt Lake City, and then it disappeared to the southeast.

According to the pilot, the saucer was observed descending at a 45 degree angle through their path. It was smooth, shiny, and circular in appearance. The pilot said it seemed to pick up speed and literally disappear. The Air Force is investigating the incident and pilots from Hill AFB questioned all members of the crew, but no satisfactory explanation was given. Unusual interest also was shown by the FBI and by members of a special committee from Washington D.C.
