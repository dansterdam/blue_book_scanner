Dear [redacted],

Your letter dated April 10, 1968, addressed to U.S. Air Force Special Investigations, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, concerning a possible sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) has been forwarded to this office for reply.

Without additional information, you cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it to this office, we will enclose an envelope, with technical instructions, that will be able to investigate this matter further.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
Lt Colonel, USAF
