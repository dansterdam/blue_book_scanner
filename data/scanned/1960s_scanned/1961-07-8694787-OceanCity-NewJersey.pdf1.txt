11. COMMENTS
This was a strong return on the scope, which seemed to be a solid object moving erratically at varying altitudes between 1500 and 3000 ft.  The lights on the object were flashing irregularly.  The radar operator stated that this was not a normal target and that the lights and motion were unlike any known aircraft.  The object was observed both visually and on the radar scope for about 10 minutes.  The object finally faded from both visual and radar observation.
