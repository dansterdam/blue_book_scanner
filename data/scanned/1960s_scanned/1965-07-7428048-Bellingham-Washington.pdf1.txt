11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Round white-bluish object came from South hover Bellingham and proceeded to the NE fading over in sight for 4 minutes. COMMENTS: Sighting consistent with either s/c or observation based on description and flight as well as duration. No identification action or s/c lights, the more likely that a Satellite was observed. Not Echo II. Likely that was Echo II or one of the brighter Satellites such as Saturn 5 or Tyros 9.
