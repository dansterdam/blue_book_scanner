With reference to your letter dated 30 January, 1968 regarding the above mentioned subject, please be advised that our records indicate that we did receive a report of a UFO on or about November 12, 1967.

However, we had one incident reported on June 2, 1967, copy of incident report enclosed with this letter, which may be of interest to your Department.

Very truly yours,
