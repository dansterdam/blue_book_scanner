UFO PHOTOGRAPHED IN ARGENTINA
Cesar Domingo La Padula, Ariel Kaplan, and Raúl Narosky, students of astronomy and physics at the National Observatory of Córdoba, Argentina, reported that on July 29, 1961 they observed and photographed a "completely irregular" aerial object at about 5:50 p.m. during daylight hours. The object was described as not maintaining the typical circular-disc shape of flying saucers, but rather as an irregular, shifting shape. The newspaper "La Voz del Interior" published accounts of the sighting and the photographs, but says the original negatives were not given to them.
The article also mentions that the object had a "glowing upper side" and a shadow underneath it, and other details that make the whole incident quite interesting. However, the newspaper "Córdoba" said that members of the Institute dedicated to have the photographs analyzed were informed that the photographers who took them were not known.
There is a note stating "See Photos on page 3", but there are no photos included on this particular page.
