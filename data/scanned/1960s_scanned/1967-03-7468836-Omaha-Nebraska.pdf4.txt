EVALUATION REPORT
UFO SAMPLE

REPORT NR: MAY 67-3
PROJECT NR: 60102102
MANUFACTURE: XXX
SUBMITTED BY: ED/UFO (Lt. F. Marley, Jr.)

I. PURPOSE:
Analysis to aid in identification of sample material.

II. FACTUAL DATA:
1. The sample material received (Analytical Branch #7-814) with indications that the inside had been subjected to immense heat, did not detect any significant elemental differences other than carbon concentration contained approximately 0.15% copper which is about normal for this type of material.
2. Spectrographic analysis of the outside material and the did not detect any significant elemental differences other than on both analysis the concentration of the outside material was approximately 0.005%. The following data was obtained:

Principal  Si
B-106      Fe & Al
1-5%       Ca, K & Na 
0.1-2%     Mg & Ti
<0.1%      All other metals

3. X-ray diffraction of the dark fused portion showed only near-white amorphous portion was also 10-20%. The fused mass in excess glass or crystallinephase.
4. Infrared absorption spectra of the outside and inside portions of the material to be inorganic and impure. The outside crystalline in nature while the inside was an impure fused glassy material.
