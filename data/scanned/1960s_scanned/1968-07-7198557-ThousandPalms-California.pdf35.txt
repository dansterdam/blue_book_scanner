Assuming incoming report indicates 
object observed at Thousand Palms, California on 7 July 1968.

The object was observed at approximately 8:50 p.m. (Pacific Daylight Time) on 7 July 1968 over the Thousand Palms area. The witness, a retired USAF pilot with over 7,000 hours of flight time, reported that he first observed the object approaching from the southwest and that it appeared to be about 1,500 to 2,000 feet in altitude. He stated that the object was triangular or wedge-shaped, and that it was approximately 30 to 40 feet in length. The witness reported that the object was metallic in appearance and that it did not have any visible means of propulsion. He also stated that the object moved at a speed that he estimated to be approximately 300 mph. The witness further reported that the object suddenly stopped and hovered for approximately 3 to 5 minutes, and that during this time it did not make any sound. The witness then stated that the object then accelerated at a rapid rate of speed and disappeared from view to the northeast.
