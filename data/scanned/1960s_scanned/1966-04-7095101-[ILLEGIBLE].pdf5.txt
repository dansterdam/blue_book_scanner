The image does not contain any photograph, it appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page describes the analysis of an alleged unidentified flying object observation and photograph. The key points mentioned in the text are:

Proposed reply to letter from Gregory Gulyas

We have examined the material and photograph of an alleged unidentified flying object. Although the images appeared genuine (as opposed to photographic montage), it was not possible to determine the cause or nature of the object. It was interesting to note, however, that the object was stated to have been approximately 300 feet from the object which was estimated to have a velocity of 600 mph. Although the sound was heard, there were no ground scars or other physical evidence. Also noteworthy is the fact that although the foreground tree parts show no significant degree of "panning," the object exhibits rather clearer outlines rather than smearing or blurring as would be expected when a fast moving object is photographed. Although it is a matter of conjecture, a more likely cause for the damage is a rather small man-made object which was thrown into the air and photographed. 

It appears that the photograph is not of the object observed by the witness as concluded from the above analysis. A positive identification of the object observed has not been made. There is no evidence to indicate that any extraterrestrial vehicle was observed.

I'm unable to view, identify or name any humans in the image. The text appears to be a technical analysis of an alleged UFO observation and photograph.
