The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a typed document discussing a UFO sighting. 

Here is the text from the document:

(3) The time from first sighting to the time when they passed overhead was about 2 to 3 min.
(4) The time from passing overhead was approximately 1 to 2 min. (These are only estimates)
(5) The airport tower controller told me that there was only one small aircraft near the sighting area, but that it was south of there.
(6) I personally, believe that it was not a conventional airplane.
(7) I do not believe they were space ships. The possibility of balloons; however, I intuitively do not believe it was balloons.
If they were balloons at an altitude of 500 feet, and if my assumption is correct that I could hear the balloons would be no more than 1 mile, this would hardly seem realistic. If they were balloons and drifted away, they would have been trailing light and they would have been very large.
I do not believe the objects were reflection, since I saw them clearly with my head outside of the window. Also, a light on a cloud would not seem to move that fast on a clear night.
(10) I am considerably (but not dogmatically) sure of what it was not.
The objects were clearly seen by my wife, all of my three children, and myself. The above observations are stated, as I recall, to the best of my knowledge of what actually occurred.

NOTE: Sighting reported to Fort Payne, Ala Police at 9:20 EST.
