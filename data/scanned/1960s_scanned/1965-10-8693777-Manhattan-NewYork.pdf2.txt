35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I was walking along the Westside Highway about 9 pm on 6 August 1965. I saw a bright light in the sky which seemed to be moving quite rapidly. I first thought it was an airplane with its landing lights on, but then I noticed it was not blinking and seemed to be traveling in an irregular path, sometimes darting back and forth. I watched it for several minutes until it disappeared behind some buildings. The object appeared to be round and seemed larger than a star. It was much brighter than the surrounding stars in the sky. I was fascinated by the way it moved and I have never seen anything like it before. If this was some type of aircraft, it was unlike any I have ever seen before. I would be interested in any information you may have on similar sightings in this area.
