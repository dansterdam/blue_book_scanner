There is no photograph present in the shared image. The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document, containing various questions and fields for the witness to fill out.

Now, as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract and output all the textual content from the document:

39. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object?
(Cirle One) Yes No

If you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate?

40. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was?
(Circle One) Yes No 

If you answered YES, then how far away would you say it was?
