The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

DEAR Mr. _____,

I am returning the file which you took on the night of October 31, 1965, in Efland, North Carolina. The film was viewed by a photo interpreter. The data contained in the photographs is consistent with the information described in your letter at the time the film was taken.

Sincerely,
