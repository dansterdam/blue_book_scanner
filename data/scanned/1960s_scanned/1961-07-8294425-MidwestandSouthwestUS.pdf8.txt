(6) A CHECK WITH CHADS WEATHER STATION DISCLOSED THE RELEASE OF
NUMEROUS BALLONS AT 1202 BY SPRINGFIELD, PEORIA, ST LOUIS, TERRE
HAUTE, DAYTON, AND OTHER WEATHER AGENCIES IN THE AREA OF LOUISVILLE.
A STRONG POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT THE SIGHTINGS COULD HAVE BEEN A
WEATHER BALOON RELEASED FROM A STATION WEST OF LOUISVILLE. THIS, IN
CONJUCTION WITH A WESTERLY FLOW OF AIR ACROSS THE SECTOR COULD HAVE
FOSITIONED A BALOON IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF LOUISVILLE AT THE TIME
OF THE SIGHTING. CHADS WEATHER STATION CONFIRMED A VESTERN FLOW UP
WOND AT ANA ALTITUDE BELOW 20,000 FT. L. NONE. M. PILOT
OF DC-6 STATED THE OBJECT MIGHT BE AN OBJECT IN SPACE.
