The image does not contain any photographs or images, it appears to be a handwritten document. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and transcribe the text found in the document:

Here has seen some of em before in the air. They not be human craft, but some sort of flying object. Craft some hundred feet long and maybe 30 ft wide as best I could tell in dim light. They just hovering and moving slowly when I first saw them.

I called my wife to come and look and she also saw them. We watched for 10-15 minutes the craft just gliding through the air without any sound. Then they sort of swish off quickly and vanished. It was not any aircraft I have ever seen before. It was a real strange sight.
