The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document. The page has a filled out questionnaire with various questions and answers related to the sighting of an unidentified object.

The text from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes
am not positive but I think it went behind a cloud

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes   No (Don't Know)   IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes   No (Don't Know)   IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound There was no sound
b. Color at a distance it was pale pink - but up me it was amber

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note: How much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
a distance I couldn't cover it definitely over us it was the size of the drawing below

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially attach trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
