35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

On the night of Nov 6, 1965 at approximately 7:30 PM, I observed a strange object in the sky. The object appeared to be hovering or stationary and was witnessed by several other persons. The object did not appear to be an aircraft or celestial body and seemed to emit some kind of light or energy. I drew a diagram to the best of my recollection of the object's appearance and motion.
