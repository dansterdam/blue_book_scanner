TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 65-44

SUBJECT: UFO ANALYSIS
LOCATION: ILOILO, AKLAY, PHILIPPINES 
DATE: 27 JUNE 1966

1. PURPOSE: To analyse photography of purported UFO's that was taken by Mr. Jose C. Tucian.

2. ANALYSIS: Reference: TM FM 11-4, Section 33, Paragraph 1. The observers statement of the electromagnetic disturbance caused by the object and its abnormal speed and silence, which are indicators of possible intelligence guided flight, and of the apparent short wave length and electromagnetic spectrum of the object, make it desirable to further analyze this photograph.

3. The film used by the observer has the characteristic sensitivity to infrared radiation and the electromagnetic spectrum of the apparent object, which enables standard films to be modified in order to extend their sensitivity toward the infrared region of the spectrum. 

4. Reference: Paragraph 13 - In this paragraph the observer covers the fact that while exposed, the film was damaged, resulting in the deterioration of these film records by stating that "frames 1-8 were destroyed". The rest of the statement seems to be indecipherable.

DATE OF REPORT: 5 November 1966
