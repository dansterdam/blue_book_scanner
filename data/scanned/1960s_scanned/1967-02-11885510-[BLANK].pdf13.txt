The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, which discusses various topics related to UFOs and extraterrestrial civilizations.

Sahara, mythical small men in China, Peruvian fairy tales, are examples. More recently, in the Soviet popular magazine, "Sputnik," 1967, Nr. 1, there is an article by Vyacheslav Zaytaev, "Visitors from Outer Space" which is full of such stories. It is stated that the author spent 30 years of his life collecting this information.

To the credit of Shklovalskiy (second edition of his book, Chapter 23) he refutes many of the ridiculous stories which have been propagated very assiduously in the West, particularly in the U.S., where they have been adopted by the adherents of the UFO cult. Other serious Soviet writer-scientists like V. N. Komarov ("Man and Mysteries of the Universe," 1966) also exhibit an exemplary caution.

In general, it appears that the problem of sensationalism in science is exactly the same both in the USSR and the U.S. There are scientists interested in the problem of extraterrestrial civilizations and there are writers who want to publish a breath-taking book. There are even combinations of the two. In the USSR, Shklovalskiy is not averse to publicizing his own wild ideas. In the West, there are F. Hoyle and George Gamow of the same type.

Modern science is so fantastic that the boundary between possible and impossible is fairly indistinct. Some people, sometimes even bona fide scientists, simply cannot discern this boundary and mix up.
