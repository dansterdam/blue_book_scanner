Spring Star Groups Appear

To take their place, the lovely star groups of Ursa Major, the larger bear, of which the big dipper (seven) is a part, and Ursa Minor, the smaller bear, with the little dipper and Polaris, the north star, are shown on the accompanying maps, which depict the sky at about 9 p.m. in the beginning of April. They look the same as in midmonth, but will be higher in the evening sky.

In addition to the stars, there is also the planet Venus, which shining brilliantly in the western sky is the evening "star" at present. 

It is in the constellation of Taurus, the bull, one of those groups which was so prominent on winter evenings.

However, now toward the east and northeast a rather different set of stellar configurations is becoming prominent. This is the constellation of Leo, the lion, with Regulus, the first magnitude star, at the sickle-shaped head, and the twin stars Castor and Pollux in Gemini, the twins, farther to the north.

But now, more toward the south and east of the groupings of stars that typify the spring sky, such as Leo and Virgo, the virgin, can be seen. Spica, a first magnitude star, is in Virgo, a little northwest of the star Arcturus in Bootes, the herdsman, with brilliant Arc...
