The image does not contain any photograph or visual elements. It appears to be a page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book UFO report, containing a questionnaire with handwritten responses.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The handwritten response states: "Quite suddenly appeared over the horizon"

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The handwritten response states: "Yes".

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The handwritten response states: "Yes".

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: The handwritten response describes the sound as "Silent ascended rapidly".
b. Color: The handwritten response describes the color as "Luminous white, quite brilliant".

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The handwritten response provides a numerical value, but without any context, I cannot interpret it accurately.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The handwritten response describes the observed object as "quite small, round in shape, and rapidly ascending into the clouds", and includes a crude sketch of the object's trajectory.
