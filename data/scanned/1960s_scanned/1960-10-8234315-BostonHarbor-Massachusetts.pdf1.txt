9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: About 4-7 bright, round objects sighted over Boston Harbor. The objects were reported to move erratically and maneuver independently until they were slightly obscured by clouds. Then the objects were observed to change direction and speed altitude and appeared to be a single bright light until the object was slightly obscured by clouds again. This cycle continued until the objects were no longer visible. The objects moved silently and were a dull white color at times. Their speed and maneuverability, however, was less bright and pronounced as a much greater specific altitude speed.

Object was approximately 59 miles southeast of Boston at an altitude of 6000 feet. Radar indicated an airspeed in excess of 700 mph, object disappeared from radar at a speed over 1000 mph.
