The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. I have produced the text found in the document as follows:

"Everything was wild that night. A strange object was in the sky. I think it was about 3 miles off. The light was very dim and flickering in brightness. It moved rapidly from side to side at a strange angel and the light seemed to get brighter at times. Then suddenly it appeared to climb rapidly straight up and disappeared. It seemed to cover great distances in very short spans of time. The object was not in sight for more than 2 or 3 minutes.

Date. From this witness, "There were no sounds coming from the object that I could hear. Approximate size of the object was about 5 to 6 inches in diameter. Color, a dull white, appeared to change at times. Time approximately 9:15 PM. Location, Shaprsville, Pennsylvania."
