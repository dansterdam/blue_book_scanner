Output of the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the text in the document:

CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED OF FLASHES OR LUMINOUS OBJECTS MOVING THROUGH THE SKY AT NIGHT AND DISAPPEARING. THESE FLASHES OR LUMINOUS OBJECTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY MANY RELIABLE OBSERVERS. SOME OF THESE REPORTS HAVE INCLUDED SKETCHES OR DRAWINGS OF THE OBJECTS SEEN. SOME OF THESE OBSERVERS HAVE ALSO REPORTED THAT THESE OBJECTS HAVE BEEN SEEN TO HOVER OR MANEUVER IN THE SKY FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. THEIR MOVEMENTS AND BEHAVIOR HAVE BEEN OF SUCH A NATURE THAT THEY CANNOT BE READILY EXPLAINED AS CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, METEORS, BALLOONS, OR OTHER KNOWN OBJECTS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THESE REPORTS MAY BE EXPLAINED AS NATURAL PHENOMENA, SUCH AS METEORS, FIREBALLS, ETC. HOWEVER, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THESE REPORTS MAY BE INDICATIVE OF THE EXISTENCE OF UNCONVENTIONAL AERIAL OBJECTS OR VEHICLES WHICH ARE AS YET UNIDENTIFIED.
