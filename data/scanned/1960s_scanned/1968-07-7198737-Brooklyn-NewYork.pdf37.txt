IF WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HELD AT ARMS LENGTH, IN SIGHT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR ANTENNA, WOULD THAT GIVE A GOOD PERSPECTIVE AS TO THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT SEEN? UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE OF GREAT VALUE IN EVALUATING REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. IT IS THEREFORE SUGGESTED THAT OBSERVERS BE INSTRUCTED TO MAKE SUCH OBSERVATIONS WHEN POSSIBLE. ALTHOUGH THIS PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED AT THE MATCH HEAD.
