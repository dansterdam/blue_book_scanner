Observer: Mrs. Archie W. Archie, 37, saw the peculiar object first. He was driving along U.S. Route 42, about 5 miles south of Berea, Ohio, when he spotted the object. It was about 1,000 feet up in the air, moving rapidly. He called out to his wife, "Look at that thing!", and she turned and saw it. It appeared to be a bright luminous object shaped somewhat like a cigar and was apparently about 25-30 feet long. It was moving silently at high speed, first in a straight line and then it started making darting motions. After it had gone on for a short distance, it suddenly seemed to "hop up" into the air, about twice its original altitude. At this point, Mr. Archie pulled off onto the shoulder. He got out of the car to observe the object which was still clearly visible, and Mrs. Archie also got out. The object continued its rapid, darting motions for about a minute, then suddenly the whole thing seemed to diminish in size, become dimmer, and then it disappeared completely. When it disappeared, there was no smoke, trail, or any other visible evidence of its having been there. What Mrs. Archie described as "something" apparently had been popping in and out of the larger object.

The color of the upper section were "dull", the divisions were indefinite. The lower section (the main body) was brilliant white, shaped somewhat like a cigar. It appeared to be about 25-30 feet long. At one point, the object started flashing a bright light, almost like a strobe light, at irregular intervals.

It was estimated that the whole sighting lasted about 6-10 min. duration. Observers: Mr. and Mrs. John W. Archie.
