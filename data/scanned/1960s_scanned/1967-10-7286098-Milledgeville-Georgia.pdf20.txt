Craig    You are being real honest about this situation?  This is exactly the way you see it?
Yes, Sir.
Craig    Do you have any ideas where this might have come from, or might have gone to?
No, Sir.  But they have been sighted around the lake out there.  I and my friends have been speculating that maybe they use the lake for cover or something, they hide under the water.
Craig    You think that it sort of lives locally?  It doesn't come from a distance?
No.  I think that it comes from a long way off.  But recently it is the same one that has been seen by everyone that lives around here.
Craig    What is the name of this lake out here, Dave?
Lake Sinclair.
Craig    Lake Sinclair.  And this is a lake that is about 20 miles long, is it?
Well, I really couldn't tell you.
Craig    Sort of a dam on a river?
There is a dam out here, I think.  It is a man-made lake, with only one part of it, and it is about 20 miles long.
Craig    Did you notice anything else about the object you saw?
It was shimmering like it had heat waves around it, or something.
Craig    Could you see any other detail on the object?  Were there any windows or lights like that?  You said that it was shimmering.
Well, it was shimmering like on a hot day, when there is a haze.  You look out a window and you see the light being diffused through the haze.  It was sort of like that.
Craig    Surrounding the whole object?
