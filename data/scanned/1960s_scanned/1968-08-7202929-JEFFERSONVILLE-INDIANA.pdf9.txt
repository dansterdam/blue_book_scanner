THERE WERE NO SOURCES OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS ON 
NEARBY VEHICLES, ETC.  IT WAS A VERY DARK NIGHT, PERHAPS LIKE A NEW MOON, AND YOU COULD NOT SEE 
YOUR HAND IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE.

THE OBJECT(S) OR LIGHT(S) APPEARED AS A POINT OF LIGHT, INDICATING VARIOUS IT APPEARED DARK AT FIRST, WHETHER IT 
IS AN ASTRONOMICAL OBJECT SUCH AS A PLANET, STAR, OR METEOR, OR A MANMADE OBJECT SUCH AS AN AIRCRAFT, APPEAR AS A POINT OF 
LIGHT, INDICATIONS OF COMPARISONS WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT ON A PLANE, ETC.

IT APPEARED TO BE A VERY SMALL OBJECT, THOUGH IT WAS ABOUT 110Â° (OR SLIGHTLY LESS) FROM STRAIGHT AHEAD OF YOU.  IT APPEARED TO BE AT A SELF-LUMINOUS, OR REFLECTION OFF THE SKY LIT BY SOME SOURCE SIMILAR TO THE MOON.  IT DID NOT BLINK OR CHANGE IN ANY FORM WHILE YOU WERE OBSERVING IT.

IT WAS SIMPLY ABOUT AS BRIGHT AS A STAR, AND REMAINED STEADY IN ITS BRIGHTNESS THROUGHOUT THE OBSERVATION. IT WAS SEARCHING ALL AROUND 
IT FOR SOME SORT OF PROJECTION.
