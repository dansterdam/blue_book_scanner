July 6, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in reply to your recent inquiry concerning an unidentified aerial object sighting. The Air Force does not send evaluations of such sightings to the public, as the matter is considered to be of essentially no concern to general policy.

The information in the form you furnished was not considered significant to enable our project office to evaluate the sighting. Reports of the type received were considered generally of no further interest, and thus estimated at 500 mph is inconsistent with motion ascribed to the object.

Your report is now carried in our files as "Conflicting Data." No investigation is presented in the form that this was not a misinterpreted conventional odject [sic] or a natural phenomenon.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
Chief, Information Division
Office of Information
