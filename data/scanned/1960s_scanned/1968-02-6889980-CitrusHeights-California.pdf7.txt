The image contains two photographs. The larger photograph on the top is a compass rose diagram, showing the directions of the compass with various labels. The smaller photographs on the bottom are landscape images, depicting a person standing on a road with mountains or hills in the background.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text from the document as requested:

A.F.R. 80-17(C1) 
THIS CASE HAS BEEN INCLUDED BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "AT" AND "TO" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON IN RELATION TO THE OBSERVER. THIS SKETCH IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH OBSERVERS SOMETIMES PREPARE SKETCHES OF THE PHENOMENON - THE LARGER SKETCH.
