Gentlemen:

Would you be so kind as to tell me what the following
flight movements were, or forward this letter to someone who can.

1) On August twenty-three at 1:20 pm I saw an aircraft moving over Ingleside, Texas. It was following a
curved course from West to East to North, was leaving
a contrail, but was moving at an incredible speed. The
only thing that set this particular craft off from any of a hundred
other high-flying planes I have seen was the fact that from a layman's point of view that it was moving
in excess of 1700 miles per hour.

2) On August twenty-eight around 9:30 p.m. perhaps
sometime after 10:00 p.m. I saw what appeared to be
a bright light moving from Southwest to Southeast. It
was only able to watch it for about 10 minutes
before it disappeared into the light of the moon.

Thank you very much for your kind attentions.

Sincerely,
WORLD WIDE TRAVEL of TEXAS, Inc.
