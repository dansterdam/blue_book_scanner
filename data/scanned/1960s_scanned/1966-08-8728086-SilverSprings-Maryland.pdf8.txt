I was fishing in my boat about 100 yards off shore when I see this strange silvery object hovering over the water. It hovered silently for several minutes and then suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a terrific speed. I was really shook up and didn't know what to think. I haven't been able to explain what I saw.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
Nov 15, 1966 to PROJECT BLUE BOOK
