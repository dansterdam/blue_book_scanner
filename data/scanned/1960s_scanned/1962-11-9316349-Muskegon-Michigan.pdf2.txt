Jupiter, Saturn Still Visible

Venus, during the present evening sky, is the brightest object in the southeast a little before midnight. Jupiter, except for the moon, is the brightest object in the northern evening sky. James Stokley reports:

ALTHOUGH the planet Venus during the evening hours at present is the brightest object in the south, almost midway to the zenith, Jupiter, the giant of the planets, is still visible in the northwest, about 25 degrees above the horizon, and will be visible in the evening for several more weeks.

Saturn, in the constellation of Capricornus, is also up until about 10:30 P.M. It is of less brilliance than Venus or Jupiter, but still easily seen. About midway through November it will disappear from the evening sky, finally reappearing in the eastern morning sky.

Mars comes up in the east about 11:00 P.M., on the 17th, and later each night. By the end of November it will be up about 9:00 P.M. This is because the planet is rapidly approaching the earth and shining brighterâ€”now 1.0 in magnitude as against 0.7 in October.

Jupiter, in the west, is now the brightest planet in the evening sky, next to the moon. When the month ends, it will be setting about 9:00 P.M. (The closest approach for this apparition occurred on November 11 when Jupiter was 368 million miles from the earth.)

And so, the two brightest planets, Venus in the east and Jupiter in the west, continue to grace the evening sky, with Saturn also visible until the last of November. The planets then will shift to the morning sky.
