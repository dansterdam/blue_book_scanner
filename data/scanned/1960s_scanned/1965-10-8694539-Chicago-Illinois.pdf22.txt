The image appears to contain a handwritten description of an observation of bright lights in the sky. The description includes details about the movement and behavior of the lights, describing them as "Seeing as how this object can gyrate Up and Down, back and forth, sideways - in a split second, it was fascinating - lights on and sudden No lights: and yet it could be plainly seen, Grayish form in the sky - about 500 ft above me - seeming to follow the Buffalo Red - about 6 car lengths ahead of me - all the way into Rochester - when I turned left onto Mt. Read Blvd. it did likewise - it turned right on Jay St. so did I, it followed me until I reached my home on Immel St when again, the lights on either one appeared."
