Reference the attached unidentified flying object report from Miss ___. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear ___,

Reference your letter of 5 August 1966 concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object on 16 October 1966. Your report has been studied by our analysts and they are unable to reach a conclusive explanation due to the date of your sighting. Sightings such as yours are extremely difficult to trace since there is such a time lapse involved. Even reports several months old are sometimes difficult to analyze.

I regret the unfortunate circumstances that arose, causing such a delay in reporting your observation. Your report will be kept on file to aid in their future investigations.

If in the future you observe another unidentified object, I suggest you place a collect telephone call to the nearest Air Force Base. They in turn will do a prompt investigation.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. For your information, your report helps provide the background on Project Blue Book, which describes the resolution of unidentified flying objects.

FOR THE COMMANDER

WARREN S. WHEELER, Colonel, USAF
