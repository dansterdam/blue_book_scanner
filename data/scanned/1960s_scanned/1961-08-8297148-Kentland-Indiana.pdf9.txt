U.S. Air Defense Command Headquarters
Colorado Springs, Colorado

Dear Sir:

I am writing to report the sighting of a UFO by myself and a friend of mine. The following report is as requested.

On the evening of August 29, 1961 we were sitting in the back yard of a residence in Kentland, Indiana. At approximately 10:00 P.M. local time, we observed an object in the sky which appeared to be illuminated. It was traveling in a westerly direction, moving at a very high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 20 seconds before passing out of sight. It appeared to be round in shape and was illuminated as if from within. There was no tail or exhaust visible and no sound was heard.

We have spent many hours observing the stars and planets with telescopes and have considerable experience in this field. This object did not resemble any known aircraft or satellite. It is because this object was so much out of the ordinary that I feel compelled to report it.

I would be very interested in and would appreciate any information you might find concerning this object.

Sincerely,
Kentland, Indiana
