Light follows cars
(1) 20 May 1963 - Napier, New Zealand
Two motorists were driving together along the highway near Napier, New Zealand, when a bright light suddenly appeared and began to follow their car. The light glowed brighter than the car's headlights and kept pace with the vehicle, maintaining a constant position about 50 feet behind it.
After driving for some distance with the light following them, the motorists increased the speed of their car in an attempt to outdistance the light, but it kept up with them effortlessly. Finally, when the car reached the outskirts of Napier, the light swerved sharply and shot away into the distance. The entire incident lasted 15-20 minutes.
There were no other details regarding the appearance or characteristics of the light, except that it was bright, steady, and seemed to be following the car of its own volition. The motorists were perplexed by the experience and could offer no explanation for it.
