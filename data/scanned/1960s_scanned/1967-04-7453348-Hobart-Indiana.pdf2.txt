The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

The text in the document reads:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 21 May 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
