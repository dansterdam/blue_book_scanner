Transcript of the text in the document:

Redditt Vanderbilt is 
Mr. Vanderbilt called in at 3:30 p.m. and described a sighting that occurred 
at approximately 3:15 p.m. today in Redditt, Onondaga County, N.Y. 

Mr. Vanderbilt saw an object that appeared to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter. He 
said the object was silver in color and appeared to hover over a small hill about 
a mile from his location. It remained in view for about 2 or 3 minutes and then 
accelerated and disappeared from sight. He said it made no sound.  

Mr. Vanderbilt was very upset and concerned. He felt the object could not have 
been a conventional aircraft. He wanted to report the sighting to the proper 
authorities.
