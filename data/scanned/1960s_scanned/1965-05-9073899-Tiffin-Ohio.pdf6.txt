The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten response to a questionnaire or survey.

Please note this text from the document:

Please send some more blanks. Since I have seen several similar objects, this must not be peculiar, but I have never seen any of these objects before - Dayton or Springfield, Ohio. I wonder and wonder how they keep from crashing. I am wondering if they had some detail blanks to take care of my experience. Some details blanks to have on hand for night sightings as this information could be more precise.
