The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with a table titled "On the Phenomenon" and some handwritten notes.

The text in the document is as follows:

ON THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE:
STOP SUDDENLY, MAKE SHARP TURNS, RUN AWAY
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE:
CHANGE COURSE
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS
STAND STILL
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR
SOME LIKE A SPOT
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE
WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

The Brightness of it producing a sillouotte on the front window of the car

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Unknown (I left the site)

B. DID YOU OBSERVE ANY CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME
(WHICH MAY HAVE OBSCURED YOUR VIEW OR BEEN IN FRONT OF SOMETHING LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?)
