1. The following agencies were contacted in regards to this UFO report in an attempt to determine if the object was an aircraft, fixed-wing or helicopter:

a. Interstate Helicopters (blue and white chopper): Negative - aircraft has not flown during past week.
b. Cutter Aviation (green chopper): Negative - neither chopper nor light aircraft airborne during that period.
c. Carco: Negative - nothing airborne in that vicinity. They did report hearing (on radio) a trip-pager call in at approximately 2245 MST for landing at Kirland arriving from that direction.
d. Alameda Airport: Seven Bar Aviation: Negative - nothing airborne during that period.
e. Coronado Airport - Southwest Skyways: Negative - nothing airborne.
f. Flight Service Station (FSS-FAA): Negative - no helicopter or flight plans, transient or local, during that period. (Individual on duty very reluctant to look up desired information)
g. FAA Tower (very cooperative): The tower personnel on duty at the time reported watching a bright light in that vicinity for approximately 10-15 minutes duration. A check with ATC Center revealed it to be a jet commander, inbound from the northeast, with high intensity strobe lights mounted on fuselage. Following identification of the object, the tower personnel turned their attention elsewhere. This sighting coincides with the time period in Mrs. Coy's report.
