It May Be Helicopter - Or It May Not: Grand Ledge Report Strains Objects
Residents of Grand Ledge, who was visited One-Time Strange by the Grand Ledge Unidentified Flying Objects, which they saw some two or three years ago, were awakened at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday by the renewal of aerial excitement. 
Five persons, all of whom live on the outskirts of Grand Ledge, were watching a large "thing" in the sky. To some it was a helicopter-to others, possibly several objects. 
This was the story, as told by William Criswell, of 1339 East Clinton Street, Grand Ledge, to The State Journal.
"I have several other neighbors", he said, "who saw the same thing I did. We were all out in the yard, looking up at this thing in the sky."
According to Criswell, the "thing" first appeared about 9:30 p.m. It remained in the sky for around 15 or 20 minutes. When it disappeared, someone said a smaller object seemed to drop down from it. 
"I could see definite lights on it, and it seemed to be rotating", Criswell said. "I've done a lot of flying, and it didn't look like a plane or helicopter to me."
One woman, living on Webster Street, saw an "oblong object with a coloration like that of a helicopter" rising and moving from the direction of Prospect and Clifford Streets. She said the object then headed in the direction of Waverly Road.
"It's hard for me to believe it was a helicopter", she said, "but I don't know what else it could be. SOMETHING was up there, that's for sure."
