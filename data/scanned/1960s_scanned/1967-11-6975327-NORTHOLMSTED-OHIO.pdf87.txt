PART 2. RUMHASABOS INCLAS
SIGHTING AT THE UDORN THEATER WHEN MY ATTENTION WAS DISTRACTED TO THE RIGHT OF THE MOVIE SCREEN TOWARDS THE TREE LINE. I OBSERVED THREE DISTINCT BRIGHT OVAL OBJECTS IN TRIANGULAR FORMATION WHICH APPEARED TO BE HOVERING AND MOVING SLOWLY TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST. THESE OBJECTS WERE EXTREMELY BRIGHT AS TO BE ALMOST BLINDING AND SEEMED TO BE SURROUNDED BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE EXHAUST OR SOME FORM OF ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE. THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO MINUTES THEN SEEMED TO ACCELERATE IN SPEED AND PASSED OUT OF SIGHT BEHIND THE TREE LINE. I IMMEDIATELY ALERTED OTHER PERSONNEL IN THE AREA AND THEY ALSO OBSERVED THE OBJECTS. I FURTHER OBSERVED THAT OTHER PERSONNEL IN THE THEATER ALSO NOTICED THE OBJECTS AND WERE POINTING THEM OUT ANIMATEDLY. THE OBJECTS WERE DEFINITELY NOT AIRCRAFT, SATELLITES OR CONVENTIONAL AERIAL VEHICLES AND WERE UNIDENTIFIED BY ALL WHO OBSERVED THEM.
