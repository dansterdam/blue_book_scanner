On July 25, 1966 at about 0845 GMT I was told of what was thought to be two satellites overhead. I went out for a moment and noticed them moving in opposite directions.

On July 26, 1966 at approximately 0730 GMT my attention was called to a bright light stationary in the northwest. It then appeared to be changing from red to green to white, occasionally white. No sound was heard.

On July 27, 1966 at about 0630 GMT my attention was called to what appeared to be a satellite moving overhead toward the Northeast at a rapid rate. Finally disappearing beyond the horizon.
