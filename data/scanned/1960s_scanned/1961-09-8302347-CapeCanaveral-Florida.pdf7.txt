LIGHT SOURCE EMANATING FROM THE IONIZATION CLOUD OF THE ATLAS-C MISSILE AND FLY AT HIGH SPEED APPROXIMATELY 25 DEGREES. (D) MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS POSITIVELY INDICATE THE GREAT IMPROBABILITY OF OBSERVING AN AIRCRAFT AT OR BELOW ANY NORMAL JET AIRCRAFT ALTITUDE SINCE THESE CALCULATIONS SHOW THAT AN AIRCRAFT AT 35,000 FT WOULD HAVE TO BE GOING ONLY 112 MPH IN ORDER TO CROSS THE TELESCOPIC FIELD IN SLIGHTLY UNDER 4 SECONDS AND AN AIRCRAFT AT LOWER ALTITUDE WOULD OF NECESSITY BE GOING PROPORTIONATELY SLOWER. AN AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN THE NORMAL SPEED RANGES OF JET AIRCRAFT WOULD BE FLYING WELL ABOVE THE OPERATING ALTITUDES OF ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT IN ORDER TO HAVE BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED AS THIS OCCURRENCE. REF PART II OF YOUR MSG IT IS BELIEVED LOGICAL TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF A SUBMARINE LAUNCHED BALLISTIC MISSILE.
