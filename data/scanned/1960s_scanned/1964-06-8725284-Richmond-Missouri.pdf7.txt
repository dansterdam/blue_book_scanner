Transcription:

At the time I saw the object, it appeared to be about 6:00 p.m. or a little later.
It was quite dark and the object itself was illuminated, but the area around it was dark.
The object appeared to be elliptical in shape, very bright and glowing, about the size of a basketball at arm's length. 
It was silent and had no obvious means of propulsion. It was moving at a steady rate of speed, possibly 500-800 mph.
Its course was straight and level. It was no sound at all. An it looked to be about 1000-1500 feet in altitude.
The object was visible for about 25-30 seconds. As I watched, it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and was gone.
That is about all I can recall at this time. There were no other witnesses that I know of. I was the only one who saw the object.
