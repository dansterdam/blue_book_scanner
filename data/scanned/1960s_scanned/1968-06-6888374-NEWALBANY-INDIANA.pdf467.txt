The image contains a compass rose diagram and two sketch-like illustrations. The compass rose diagram provides instructions on how to indicate the direction of a phenomenon when first seen, using an "A" and "B" placement on the compass. The two illustrations show landscape scenes, with a person standing in the foreground of each scene.

9A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. IN THE MARGIN PROVIDE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SHAPE, SIZE, COLOR, AND OTHER DISTINGUISHING FEATURES. APPEAR TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED, OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
