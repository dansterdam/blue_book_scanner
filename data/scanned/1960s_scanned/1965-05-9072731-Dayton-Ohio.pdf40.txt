The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram with instructions. The diagram shows an illustration of a compass and instructions for the observer to sketch the motion of an object or objects. The text instructions describe how to use the diagram to represent the observed object's position, height, and changes in direction.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object(s) were above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
OBJECT MOVED 10 SANTIS. 5-6 DIAMETER 20 SECONDS

29. IF there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
