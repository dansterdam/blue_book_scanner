MEMORANDUM FOR CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY DIVISION, SAFLI

SUBJECT: Proposed reply to 

The April 13th, 1962 event noted by Mr. was thoroughly investigated by the USAF. This unusual sighting of multiple objects from several well-regarded individuals in the Eureka, Leamington, and Silver City, Utah areas was examined in detail. An attempt was made to locate and interview various witnesses indicated their sightings, but this was not fully accomplished due to the time elapsed and normal difficulties in such investigations.

Detailed study of the depositions have led to the conclusion that the "Cascade" type explosion was witnessed and is regarded the essence of the various sightings reported - the big explosion followed unidentified flying objects.

Lt Colonel Herr and Dr. J. Allen Hynek conducted the investigation for the Air Force. Detailed reports are on file in this case.
