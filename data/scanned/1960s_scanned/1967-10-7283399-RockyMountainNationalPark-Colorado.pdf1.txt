10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The observer saw an extremely bright white light in the western sky. The light traveled in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed until it disappeared. No noise was heard at any time. This description of the object is similar to observations of the object even though it was heard. The observer was sent a lot to complete a description. Because this additional information was never permitted to us, the case is being evaluated as INSUFFICIENT DATA.
