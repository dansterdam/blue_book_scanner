FIELD INVESTIGATION REPORT
CATEGORY P - PHOTOGRAPHIC
CASE NO. 9736406
DATE OF REPORT: 9 Oct 1963
DATE OF SIGHTING: 8 Oct 1963
LOCATION: Sioux City, Iowa
TIME OF SIGHTING: 1855L
SUBMITTED BY: Capt Randall C. Archer, AD/INT
SUMMARY:
On 8 October 1963, at approximately 1855L, Mr. X, a civilian employee at the Houlton Electronics Plant, Sioux City, Iowa, observed a bright, luminous object moving rapidly across the sky in a westerly direction. The object appeared similar to a bright star, but was moving much faster than any known conventional aircraft. It was visible for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing from view.
Mr. X immediately reported the sighting to his supervisor, who in turn notified the Sioux City Air Force Base. A field investigation was subsequently conducted by Capt Randall C. Archer of the Air Defense Intelligence Division.
CONCLUSION:
Based on the investigation, this case is classified as "INSUFFICIENT DATA." While the sighting appears to be of an unidentified aerial phenomenon, the lack of descriptive details and the absence of any corroborating evidence or witnesses prevents a more definitive conclusion at this time.
