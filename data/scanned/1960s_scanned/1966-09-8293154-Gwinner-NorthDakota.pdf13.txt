Dear Sir:

When I called this morning at your office to discuss an incident that occurred during the evening of September 7, 1966, I did not have the opportunity to present all the details and some things I believe are significant as some things were not clear to me at that time. It was not until a day or two later that I obtained further information that clarifies certain aspects of the incident.

It was about 10 miles from farm house. I first observed the object at approximately 7:45 p.m. It appeared to be about the size of a basketball at arm's length and was hovering about 100 feet above the ground. It seemed to be a solid object with a metallic appearance and emitted a dull glow. At times it appeared to change color slightly from a dull white to a slight bluish tint. It remained stationary for several minutes, then began to move slowly in a horizontal direction for a distance of about 1/2 mile and then stopped again. It was at this point I called my wife to observe the object. She watched it for several minutes before it suddenly shot straight up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The entire episode lasted about 10 minutes.
