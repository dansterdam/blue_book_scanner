Flying Saucer Chased 
By Law for 86 Miles
RAVENNA, Ohio (AP) - "We 
never want to see it again," said a 
deputy sheriff who chased the ob-
ject from Ohio into Pennsylvania.

Hundreds of persons in both 
states reported seeing the "bril-
liant and shiny" object early Sat-
urday.

Police Chief Gerald Buchert of 
Ravenna, said eight police cars 
from his department and others 
chased the object for 86 miles. The 
picture of the object from his front 
yard showed it to be "brilliant and 
shiny," he said.

So far as Project Blue Book headquarters at Wright-Patterson 
Air Force base in Ohio could 
tell, the object was not identified. 
The spokesman also said no Blue-
book office yet.

Buchert said it looked like a
bright star at first together.

Deputy Sheriff Dale Spaur said
he and his partner, W. L. Neff,
were close "to the object when wes-
tern Pennsylvania." Spaur said it
was brilliant and straight up."
