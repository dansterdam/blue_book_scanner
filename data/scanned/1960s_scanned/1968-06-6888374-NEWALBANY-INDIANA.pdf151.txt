This page appears to be from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image contains a compass rose diagram with instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction to a phenomenon when first seen. Below the compass rose, there are two sketches depicting a person's perspective of a UFO sighting. The sketches show the horizon and landscape from the observer's point of view.

AFR 80-17(CI)
NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "S" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "S" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "S" WITH A LINE TO SHOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "S". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
