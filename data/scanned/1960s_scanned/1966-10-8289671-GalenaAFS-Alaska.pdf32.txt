There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document describing various types of UFO sightings and their characteristics.

"like a star" or "round" or "too far away to tell." Its height was generally taken to be about that of airliners. Observations lasted 2 to 20 minutes, the object sometimes disappearing while still in the sky.

Type C: The object was white, and sometimes alternating with white, and sometimes with other red, green, or white lights moving together. The course was generally straight, although the object sometimes appeared to change course or come to a stop.

Most (all but about 10) of the incidents fell into these three categories. Type A objects are stars, type B are satellites, and type C are high altitude aircraft. All descriptions which fit the above summaries with no anomalies were taken to be identified.

The aspects of type A sightings which caused the witnesses to report them as UFOs were the changing colors and the erratic motions.

In a few cases the slow drift due to the rising or setting of the object was taken to indicate something out of the ordinary. In other words, many people did not know that stars show color scintillations when near the horizon, and were not aware that prolonged fixation on an isolated object will result in apparent motions due to the natural shifting of the eyes, and did not know that stars rise and set. All these effects were attributed to the object itself.

Type B sightings gave rise to UFO reports partly, perhaps even primarily, because of the "echo effect," the illusion which makes uniformly satellites appear to follow a waviering path. Also cited as unusual were changes in color due to changing atmospheric scattering as the elevation angle changed, and color-scintillation effects near the horizon. Some
