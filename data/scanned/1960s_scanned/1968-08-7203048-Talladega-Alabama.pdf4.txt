Transcript of the text in the document:

As a matter of historical fact, the Air Force has considered this case well substantiated and typical of the better documented cases in Project Blue Book - most of these cases being of an ambiguous nature and not susceptible to precise evaluation. Many investigators have considered this case to be of major importance as another indication of a genuine unknown phenomenon. The case was closed as unknown at the time it occurred and there is no indication that the nature of the phenomenon has been determined by any subsequent investigation.
