Conversations of 19 July 1966 regarding observations on the night of 18 Jul 66

Check with WHIO. The man who answered the switchboard said that he didn't have anything in his script about the UFOs last being a neon sign for a car dealer flying over Dayton. He said to listen to the 8 o'clock news.

Check with the Clinton County AFP, Ohio Weather Bureau - Negative.

Check with the Police Department - specifically Lt. Hado. He observed what he assumed to be a sign being towed by a commercial plane. The object appeared to be going East to West, thought it was probably over Springboro. Lasted to be at about 1000 ft, probably around 8 and 9 pm. If we want further information check with the Records people, Sgt. Hanby. They hadn't given any further thought to the observation because it definitely appeared as a/c with banner in tow.
He had been down to watch the Cincinnati Reds play ball the other week when Frisch's had a similar banner flying over the ball park for approximately one hour.

Spoke with WHIO newsroom. They had gotten their information from the newspaper and therefore didn't know who the car dealer was.
