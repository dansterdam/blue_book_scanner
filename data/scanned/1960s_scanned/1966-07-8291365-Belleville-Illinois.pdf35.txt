"Last summer, June 1966, my employees down to the beach and had a fireworks display. We saw something in the sky that evening that I thought to be a falling star. After watching it for a few seconds, it began to get brighter and started to move across the sky in a southerly direction and other people stood on a jetty that a wooden plank protruding
into the bay to look at this object (a falling star as I thought). When it got up above the trees, then Mr. D...his wife and two small children saw this object which I thought to be a falling star and they said in the family it turned out to be something travelling very much lower and larger than the typical falling star. It moved in a southeasterly direction at a slow pace and then stopped and hovered for a few minutes and then started again, moving across the sky and going very high into the distance and disappear. There will be 4 of the family to verify this sighting as there will be my wife and when this occurred, we called the officer on the jetty and ask him to see if he could tell us what it was as it left us puzzled. I remarked it was going to report it to the Air Force. Just then he said to look up into the sky and there it was again. This time it stayed in view much longer and the whole family watched it as it just moved along and then disappear in the distance. It was round and glowed and was about ten times the size of a star, moving under it's own power and very high under another ball of light. It also went downwind and could not see it again."
