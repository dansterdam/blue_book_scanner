There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. However, the page contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram showing the direction of movement of the observed object.

The text on the page reads:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? The witness stated that "it seemed to dissolve while moving a short distance east".

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes  No  Don't Know. IF you answered YES, the witness indicated that the object was partially obscured by clouds.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes  No  Don't Know. IF you answered YES, the witness indicated that the object was in front of clouds.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: it made no noise.
b. Color: white or light-colored.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. If you have performed this experiment, tell us how much of the object was covered by the match head?
The witness stated "About".

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the direction of motion, such as arrows, protrusions, etc., and especially show its trail or path of the object. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The hand-drawn sketch shows an object with an elongated, pear-shaped form moving from right to left, with an arrow indicating the direction of movement.
