4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: G Ground-Visual, G Air-Visual
5. PHOTOS: G Yes, G No
6. SOURCE: CIVILIAN
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2-3 min
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Object approx size of dime held at arm's length. Large fire diminishing in size and dropping burning debris. Loud explosion followed by scattered 70-80 disappearance into horizon.
11. COMMENTS: There is no insufficient evidence available for a valid conclusion. Object had all characteristics of a solid, well-defined silhouette. However, duration of the observation was too brief to enable a conclusive evaluation. Three fragments of 1950 spitfire that registered during the latter part of September is a possibility, but is only conjecture without more definitive data to confirm or deny it.
