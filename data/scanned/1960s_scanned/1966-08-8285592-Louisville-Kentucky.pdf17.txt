A vivid & clear object approx. 75' across which moved from S.E. to N.W. low on the horizon about 45' above the ground. It appeared to be metallic & in the form of a disc or ellipse with a slight dome on top. It was making no sound & moved at about 300 M.P.H.

23 + 48: After after 12:00 A.M. about 2:00 A.M. there were 2 objects
26 - 10:30 P.M.: They were 2 lights shining steady +- quite big. They moved erratically + fast. Some times they split up and then came together again.
27 - 12:30 A.M.: Saw 1 object moving across the sky at tremendous speed. It did not seem to be a star or planet.  
39 - Not a telescope + saw very distinct what appeared to be about 15-20 feet long. Craft approached, approx 1/2 mile away & apparently 15-20 feet long. Larger craft appeared to be a elliptical shape & much larger than the smaller craft approach + there were 2 more circling around the larger craft. Though shining very bright, seemed to reflect light in a dull reddish glow. They were moving at very high speeds around the larger craft & would stop moving suddenly & then speed off in another direction.
