The image provided does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a blank page from a Project Blue Book document, with the title "INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE." at the top.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.
