REPORT

According to the description, the object sighted was "a brilliant orange color appeared above the horizon in the southwest at an estimated altitude of about 12,000 feet. It remained stationary for about 35 minutes, but an hour later it returned and was again observed for about 15 minutes. The object appeared near white, traveling at a fast speed, then it suddenly stopped, hovered for a while, and then took off at a tremendous speed and disappeared."

Mr. S. S. Tapling, the witness, stated that "when the object first appeared, he immediately began to photograph it, but when he pressed the release, it suddenly disappeared. Two minutes later (six-minute, .16-mm), as he was re-adjusting the camera, the object reappeared in the same location, and he was able to make two more exposures."

The report concludes that "the object was visible on the two exposures obtained, and that it was a real physical object, not a reflection or optical illusion."
