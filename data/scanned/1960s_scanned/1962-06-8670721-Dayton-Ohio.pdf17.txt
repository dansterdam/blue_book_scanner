The image on this page contains two sketches. The first sketch depicts an object in the sky and instructs the viewer to draw an "X" at the point where the object was first seen, and to indicate how high the object was above the horizon. The second sketch shows a road or pathway with a person standing in the distance, and instructs the viewer to draw an "A" at the position where the object was seen.
