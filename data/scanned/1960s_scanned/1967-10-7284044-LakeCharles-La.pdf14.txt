27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTION:
The undersigned, F. P. Moorer, Chief Deputy Sheriff of Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, was called to the scene on October 4, 1967, at approximately 7:30 P.M. to investigate a report of an unidentified flying object seen by several persons. Upon arrival, it was learned that the object had been seen by five witnesses, as follows:
1. Mrs. Gene Hebert, Route 1, Lake Charles, Louisiana, who reported seeing the object at approximately 7:15 P.M. as she was driving home from work. She described it as a large round, silver object which hovered over the treetops at a distance of about 300 yards from her car, and then suddenly shot upward at a very high rate of speed.
2. Mr. Roy Morris, Jr., also of Route 1, Lake Charles, Louisiana, who was with Mrs. Hebert at the time and corroborated her story.
3. Mr. Aldon Guidry, who lives on Prien Lake Road, Lake Charles, Louisiana, who reported seeing the object at the same time from his backyard.
4. Mr. Alvin Leger, who lives on Prien Lake Road, Lake Charles, Louisiana, who also reported seeing the object at the same time from his backyard.
5. Mrs. Guidry, wife of Mr. Aldon Guidry, who also reported seeing the object at the same time from their backyard.
All of the above witnesses described the object in a similar fashion - a large, round, silver object which hovered low over the trees and then shot upward at a high rate of speed. None of the witnesses could estimate the size of the object, but all stated that it was much larger than an airplane or helicopter.
This report is submitted in compliance with Air Force Regulation 80-17.
