REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
DATE: 7 August 1965

PLACE: Whiteman AFB, Missouri

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Sighting
DETAILS:
On July 20, 1965, a red light was observed by Captain William L. Thompson, USAF of the 351st Strategic Missile Wing, Whiteman AFB, Missouri. The light was observed for approximately 30 minutes from 0130 to 0200 hours. The following is Captain Thompson's statement describing the incident:

"On 20 July 1965, I was on alert duty in Missile Crew Building No. 2 at Whiteman AFB, Missouri. At approximately 0130 hours, I looked out the south window and observed a red light in the sky. The light appeared to be stationary or hovering at an estimated altitude of 1500 feet and at a distance of approximately 5 miles from the base. The light flashed on and off at irregular intervals. At times, the light appeared to change size and shape, and occasionally it appeared to pulse or throb. I observed the light for about 30 minutes until it disappeared from view at approximately 0200 hours. During the time I observed the light, it remained stationary and did not appear to move.

At approximately 0215 hours, I called the Command Post and reported the sighting. The Command Post acknowledged my report and stated that the object had also been observed by other personnel at the base. No aircraft were observed in the vicinity of the light during the time it was under observation."
