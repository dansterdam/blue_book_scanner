Dear sir, I seem this the other night around 7:30 it was still light out and went off from me. I got my field glasses and took a good look at it. It look like it was round glasing scaly to land. it was followed by dark in to go a bright color, silver it went back and dark then it climbed straight up and went over the hills away from our house. It seemed to be the hight of a regular plane up about 3500 feet and I got a good idea where it headed. [signed]
