I got up to go inside to make a phone call and as I was going to the house I happen to look up in the sky. I noticed a small star-like object moving rapidly to the east. I would estimate the speed of the object at about 500 miles per hour based on its fast movement, compared to the motion of regular aircraft. The object was white in color, about the size of a bright star, and it flew in a straight line, not up and down or side to side.
I do not know what the object was. It could have been a fast moving satellite or a shooting star. Radars throughout the area at that time were negative.
