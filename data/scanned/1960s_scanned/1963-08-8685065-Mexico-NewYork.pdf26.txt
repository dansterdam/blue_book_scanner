SATURN SHINES THROUGH NIGHT

Saturn, the ringed planet, appearing in the southeast in the evening, is at opposition this month, the best time for observing it.

By JAMES STOKLEY

THREE and possibly four planets will be visible in the night sky this month. In the evening, Saturn shines brilliantly and Jupiter also puts in an appearance, while in the morning hours, Mars and Venus may be seen. 

Saturn, which shines with a brilliance rivaling that of Sirius, the brightest star, is at opposition this month. This means that it is on the opposite side of the earth from the sun, and therefore is highest in the sky at midnight, when only brighter than any star in that part of the heavens.

Jupiter Appears

JUPITER will be brightest in the early evening. It is about 14 times as bright as the bright star Sirius, and is in the southern part of the constellation Virgo, not far from the bright star Spica, the principal star of that constellation. Together with the bright Saturn to the east, this makes a fine pair of "twin" planets to watch.

Two other constellations that are typical summetime one are visible low in the north and northwest, Lyra with its brilliant blue-white star Vega, and Cygnus, the Swan, with its bright first-magnitude star Deneb. The most famous summer constellation, Scorpius, with its bright red star Antares, is fairly low in the south.
