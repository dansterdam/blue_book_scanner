Proposed reply to letter from Gary Biser, 24 March 1967

Dear [redacted],

Reference your recent letter regarding the observation of an unidentified flying object over the Toledo, Ohio area. It is extremely important that the Air Force be contacted as soon as possible following the observation. Several of the reports were quite old; therefore, a meaningful scientific investigation would not be possible. The information will be investigated by Project Blue Book and filed accordingly.
