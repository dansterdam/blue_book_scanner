1. Attached is the report of investigation by Dr G W Demisz, of the alleged Brooksville Flying Saucer sighting. As you can see, Dr Demisz's report further confirms my suspicions about this whole affair. Dr Demisz' s report further confirms my suspicions about this whole prior to issuing the press.

2. I agree with Colonel Maniere's recommendation with regards to reimbursing Dr Demisz for his transportation, lodging, and the standard consultant fee if you can come up with the money. Please communicate directly with Colonel Maniere and give him the necessary approval/authority so he could take care of this.

It is the opinion of this office that the services rendered by Dr. Demisz were of an investigative nature, and that an information nature. Since a UFO sighting was not available for this purpose, it is suggested that no further action be taken by Dr. Demisz.
