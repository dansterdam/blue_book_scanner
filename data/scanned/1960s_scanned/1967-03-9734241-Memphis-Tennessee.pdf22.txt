1. This replies to your recent letter in which you requested the evaluation of your observation.

2. You described the unidentified object as looking like an airplane, slightly higher than most airliners and traveling at a faster rate of an airplane landing pattern used by most planes landing at the Municipal Airport. For clarity, we have your description that the object's movement was similar to that of an airplane landing.

There is no indication that you observed anything extraordinary. On the basis of your description, the object appears to have been a conventional aircraft for which there would be a reasonable explanation. We do not consider the sighting of this object to be related to unidentified flying objects.

3. The Air Force cannot confirm or identify the names or witnesses to UFO sightings without their permission. UFO cases are filed confidentially and not made publicly known. A search for information in our office records did not reveal any information about this sighting that could be provided.

4. The enclosed Blue Book brochure may be of interest to you. Thank you for your letter.
