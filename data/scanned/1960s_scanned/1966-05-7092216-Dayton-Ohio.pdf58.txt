The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, with a handwritten response to a questionnaire.

The text from the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
9 - June - 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
