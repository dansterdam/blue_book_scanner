HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "Y" WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE APPARENT PATH OF MOVEMENT, AND SKETCH IN ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS THAT MAY BE HELPFUL IN IDENTIFYING THE PHENOMENON.
