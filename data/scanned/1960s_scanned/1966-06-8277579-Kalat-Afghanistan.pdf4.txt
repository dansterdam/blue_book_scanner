Transcribed text from the document:

- 3 -
Though the object was in the past, it was among the last four objects to disappear from the night sky. The other three were the moon, one star in the west, and another star almost directly overhead, but strangely to the side of Kalat.

While it is entirely possible that the disappearance of the object while it was undoubtedly in motion may have been due to hilliness or mountains in the area, the manner in which the object disappeared was the same as when it first appeared and returned while we remained in the area.

I understand that M/ S- will be filling an affidavit similar to this. I also understand that M/ S- have been interviewed, and they were supposed to watch for the object at length but we have not file a report.

And further deponent saith not.

Subscribed and sworn before me this 16th day of June, 1966.
