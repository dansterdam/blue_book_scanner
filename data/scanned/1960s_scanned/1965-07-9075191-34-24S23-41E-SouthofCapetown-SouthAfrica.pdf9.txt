SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT:

On Friday the 2nd July, 1965 at 0215 EAST while on passage from Durban to Cape Town and in Lat. 34.22'S Long 23.11'E the following was observed:

An object having a bluish-gray (?) shape and size of a small orange and blue/white in colour was seen to move slowly in a horizontal direction at an altitude of approx. 35'.

After moving for about 5 seconds in this manner, the object became still stationary and remained so for a further second. It then turned and moved rapidly in a westerly direction.

No sound was heard and it is estimated that the explosion occurred about 5 miles from the vessel.

Weather conditions - Cloudiness sky and good visibility. Barometer 1018.6 Temp. 20Â°C.
Your faithfully,
