shoulder of the road and stared
at what they saw. "It seemed
to be hovering over the road," 
they said. It seemed to be
hovering - a bright object in
the night sky. This is Deputy
Basker, an officer with
Bermuda police and Capt. Wallace
of the Bermuda police. They hope
to the object could move
down and examine it closer but
suddenly it just zoomed up and
disappeared." 
"They said that there was a
vivid divided white light emanating 
from the object as it rose upwards
out of sight," Basker said.  
The said the object came low
to the ground, almost to the top
of a city tree.
"Then, as it came, the object
went back down, towards the
north west and we stepped up
to follow it," they said. "But 
when we got there, the object 
had zoomed up and disappeared."
"They said they had sight of
the object for about 5 minutes
and here is a decription of what 
they saw: Round in shape, a bright
white light that did not flicker 
or pulse, no trail of smoke or fire, 
no sound, it just hung there and then 
zoomed up and disappeared."

This time, the officers turned
their lights on and shone them
where the object had been hovering.
The object first appeared in the east
and then it seemed to move to the
north-west. The object flashed on and
off, a bright white light, then it would 
go dim, then bright again. It seemed to
be a solid object rather than an
aircraft with running lights. But it
still was a bright light, almost as
bright as if a searchlight was directed
up at the sky - but it seemed to be
hanging there - a bright light in
the sky. Captain Wallace and Deputy
Basker had the object under observation
for about 5 minutes and then it just
zoomed up and disappeared.
They reported the incident was witnessed
by Capt. Wallace, Deputy Basker, and 
two other officers whose names were
not given.
