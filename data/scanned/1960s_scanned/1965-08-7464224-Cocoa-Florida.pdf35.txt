SPACEMAN z: "Tsk, tsk,
looks like that is one of those
silly machines that the
earth-people have been talking
about - wheels and
all. Doesn't that just seem the
most primitive thing to
us space visitors?"
SPACEMAN X: "Must be
something the earth-people call
a 'automobile'. We don't have
anything like that on the
space craft. But their machines
can only move along the
ground - just crawl like insects
without any wings at all."
SPACEMAN Z: "Yes, it is
amusing building as it does on
some ancient instinct of the
earth-people that says 'Service
Station' - whatever that means.
As if a mere station could
service their crude
contraptions!"
SPACEMAN X: "Marvelous,
isn't it? And all the
primitive things they have to
do to keep those machines
running. Stopping at places and
pouring strange liquids into
openings, and cranking and
pushing and shoving. Makes me
shudder to think of the
trouble they have with their
crude technology."
SPACEMAN Z: "Well, it
certainly is all rather quaint and
curious, isn't it? But I suppose
we mustn't be too critical. They
are just beginning, after all,
and they seem to be
progressing, in their own
awkward way. Perhaps someday
they'll develop something a
little more advanced. Who
knows?"
ONE FINAL NOTE:
The Air Force tells us the
above conversation was monitored
by their interplanetary
surveillance equipment. It's a
rather droll and somewhat
patronizing commentary, but
very illuminating as to the
Spacemen's attitude toward our
automotive civilization.
