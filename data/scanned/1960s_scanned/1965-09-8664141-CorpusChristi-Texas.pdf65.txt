Triangular UFO Over Valladolid
Our contributor is a nun-in-Waiting at the Dominicos College in Valladolid, in Spain.

YESTERDAY AT 8:25 P.M. (September 7, 1965) the nun was sitting in the church sacristy of the college, when through a window she saw a triangular-shaped object pass directly over our school. A father and a brother, who were in the sacristy at the time also saw the object.

According to the nun's description, the object was completely silent, and about the size of a car. It was a dull, dark color and seemed to be metallic. The object moved very slowly and smoothly, without making the slightest noise. It passed over the college and disappeared towards the northeast.

The nun said that what she saw was so unusual that she immediately called the attention of the father and the brother who were in the sacristy. They also saw the object and were amazed at its strange appearance and behavior. The nun stated that she had never seen anything like it before.

We all think that this was a genuine UFO sighting. At 7:55 p.m., the UFO began to be seen, and it disappeared at 8:00 p.m. What a pity it did not come down, otherwise we would have had a splendid opportunity to examine it more closely.
