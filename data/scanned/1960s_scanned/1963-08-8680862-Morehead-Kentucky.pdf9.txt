The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text from the document:

1.) a northwest direction. I am not qualified to judge altitude due to distance but the plane was not at extreme altitude because as I mentioned the wings and trail were clearly discernible. The objects did not give off light. The plane and objects were below the level of the sun which had set but which still lit up the horizon. My father ventured the objects might be atmospheric probes of some kind which were attached to the plane by rods which would not have been visible at that distance. Perhaps you will be able to solve the puzzle.
