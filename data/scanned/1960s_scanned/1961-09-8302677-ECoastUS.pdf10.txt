Dear ***

Your letter of 21 September 1961 regarding the sighting of a unknown object by the crew of an Eastern Airlines flight on 13 September 1961 has been received and considered.

Your account of this sighting report seems to be a bona fide experience. The object launched from Wallops Island, Virginia, which released a trail as it moved up and down the Atlantic Ocean, up and down the Atlantic seaboard of the mid-eastern U.S.

A copy of your report has been forwarded to the Office of Aerospace Technical Intelligence, USAF, and the Division of Intelligence, USAF. Your interest in reporting this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
