Enclosed are Addendums to the 9-3-65 Kennebunk, Maine and 9-22-65 Exeter, New Hampshire "Saturday Review" which carried a write-up on our investigation of the sightings of a conventional aircraft but which identification is as yet inconclusive. There are several disturbing facts which could point to the possibility of a UFO incident. I would appreciate your comments on these reports and your opinion as to the accuracy of the sighting account.

Sincerely, 
Raymond E. Fowler
NICAP Investigator
