Proposed reply to correspondence from [redacted]

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your sighting of 2 February 1966 in which a photograph was taken of an alleged unidentified flying object.

The additional information received (letter dated 16 August 1966) has not been of value in identifying the image on the photograph. The flashbulb, which was used, would have had little or no effect on the illumination of an object a distance of 600 feet when used in conjunction with a lens aperture of f 4.5. As stated in the letter, the camera used was a 4 x 5 speed graphic with a normal lens. The camera focal length was not given.

As for the report, although a positive identification of the stimuli has not been made, it is felt that you observed an aircraft. It should be noted that the reports of Mr. [redacted] concerning the appearance (color) and movement of the object are several respects concerning the appearance (color) and movement of the object are several respects concerning the appearance (color) and movement of the object are several respects concerning the appearance (color) and movement of the object are several respects contradictory.

As reported in the earlier photo analysis report, (reference letter of 2 August 1966 from Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson) we are unable to make a positive measurement of the image without the additional information.

Enclosure:
1. Original Negative
2. One print
