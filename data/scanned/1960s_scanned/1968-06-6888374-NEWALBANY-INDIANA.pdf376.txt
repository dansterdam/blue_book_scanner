AFR 80-17(C)
15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.
16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE OBJECT HELD A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET SIGN OR THE MOON? ESTIMATE THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE OBJECT THIS WOULD INDICATE RELATIVE TO A FAMILIAR OBJECT. HOWEVER, ONLY STATE THIS ANGULAR MEASUREMENT IF IT CAN BE STATED WITH CONFIDENCE; IT IS USUALLY DIFFICULT TO JUDGE ANGULAR SIZES ACCURATELY.
