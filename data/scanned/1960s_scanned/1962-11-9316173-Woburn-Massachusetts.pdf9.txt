Flying Egg In Massachusetts
Charles F. Kirk, Jr., of Woburn, Mass., reported to the Woburn Times, Woburn, Mass., that on the 8th of November, 1962, he had sighted a "streamlined egg-shape object" that hovered over Woburn for several minutes between 6 and 6:10 p.m. He said it looked like a streamlined object with a projection (or protrusion) on the side. It slowly changed position and estimated its altitude at less than 200 feet. Kirk, who is a machinist and carpenter for the Wells Machine Company, was working on one of the company's new building on Salem Street when he noticed the strange object. He said it seemed to reflect a bluish-green light and was about 10 feet long, 20 feet wide and about 15 feet in height. But, he added, that exact size was much larger. It was obviously upset by his encounter, and he described his "weird feeling" of being watched. (See article about Barney Hill sighting). He said he thought he saw the object twice more but couldn't be sure.
The object was shallow, flat on the bottom, with a black band near the lower edge and a projection or protrusion on it. This strange object (the same one?) was seen by others, according to the local news. Except for the building, the article doesn't mention any other details.
