At 9:30 p.m. about August 9, 1961, while standing outside in my yard, I observed a light in the northern sky which at first appeared to be a distant airplane. As it came closer, I observed that it was moving quite rapidly, and did not have the characteristics of an aircraft. The light was a steady, brilliant white, and appeared to be in the shape of a disk or oval. There were no wings, tail, or other appendages visible. The light did not blink or flash, and appeared to be self-luminous. It moved in a horizontal direction at a high rate of speed, and then made an abrupt change in direction, moving upward at a steep angle and disappearing from sight within a few seconds. I have never before observed anything like this, and was quite startled by the strange behavior and appearance of the object.
