Children Observe UAO
David and Michael Saunders of 17 Twin Pines Drive, looked up from their play around 8:00 one afternoon, and saw a moving object which they first thought was a helicopter. However, the object was peculiar and remained in sight over a period of 45 minutes, located in St. John Valley, and the account of the sighting was published in Madawaska, Maine.
The youngsters called their grandmother from the house, and by the time the women arrived, the object had disappeared. The children are David, age 11, and Michael, age 9. The investigator was a Sergeant from the Canadian Border Patrol, P.R. Kent.
At 3:30 P.M. on August 31, David and Michael observed a bright, metallic, round disc-shaped object moving slowly toward the north-west. It was estimated to be about 40 miles north of Cyr Mountain on the road from Alright Point to Soldier Pond, St. David. David watched the object move for about 15 minutes, during which time it moved from the vicinity of the Constellation Orion. This latter sighting could not have been viewed through binoculars nor did the boys have such equipment. After the boys saw the disc-shaped object leave, they observed it again for a few minutes until it disappeared.
