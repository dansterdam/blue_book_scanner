Dim Those Lights, 
You Look Like UFO

TACOMA, Wash., Sept. 3â€”Reports 
of people in the Tacoma area mistaking
bright exterior lights for UFO's have prompted 
the Tacoma Manufadturing Co. of Tacoma, Wash. to suggest:

"Dim Those Lights, You Look Like UFO".

The company said its anti-ceilition lights, meant to warn air traffic, are being mistaken for UFO's. A company spokesman said the lights, 
which are being installed on a 200-foot chimney
will be dimmed if the mistake continues.
The spokesman said he didn't want to add to the UFO mystery.
