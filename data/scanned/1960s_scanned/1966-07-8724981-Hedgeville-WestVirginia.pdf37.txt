No case info only

July 30 1966
Hedgeville, West Virginia

This case warrants in my opinion who reported what happened. As indicated, the report indicates a humanoid appeared, about 3 1/2 feet tall. The witness claims to have seen this entity with his own eyes at close range. He was about 30-40 years old, with wavy hair and a reddish face. The entity made a humming noise and the witness became afraid, so he lowered his head. When he looked up again, the entity was gone. The witness claims he has never seen anything like this before. He is not an astronomer, nor an expert on unusual or UFO phenomena. However, he is very impressed by what he witnessed and wanted it reported. I suggest we assign this case a thorough investigation, as there seems to be no indication of hoax or misidentification. The witness appears to be sincere in his report. A more detailed interview may provide additional information. No photographs were taken.
