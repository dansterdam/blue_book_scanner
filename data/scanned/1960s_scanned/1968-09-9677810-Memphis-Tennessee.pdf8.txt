The image contains a meteorological chart or map, which appears to be from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The map shows weather patterns and frontal systems across a region, likely the United States, on Tuesday, September 10, 1968. There is no photograph visible in this image.
