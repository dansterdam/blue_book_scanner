The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document with a form and handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

34. Have you completed this questionnaire?
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or narrative explanation of your sighting.

I sensed now at distance only a light from a house and I thought at first I looked at light from a house what I saw was a round object with long and pale light which I soon recognized was not a light from a house it was longer and wider and much brighter than a light from a house it moved very slowly without any noise of motor and disappeared behind a hill I was sure I was not dreaming and it was not imagination every detail is clear and true. I am convinced that I saw a something which is not from this world possibly some kind of flying object from another planet.
