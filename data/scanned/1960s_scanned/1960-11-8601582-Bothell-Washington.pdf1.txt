There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record card that contains text describing an observation. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

PROJECT 10,073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE      30 May 55
2. DATE-TIME GROUP    2020
3. CITY
   LOCATION     Bothell, Washington
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION    a. Ground-Visual
   b. Aerial-Visual
5. DURATION OF OBSERVATION    Approx. 1 Min.
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS    1
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION    1 Min.
8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING    Very large, round, glowing object, descended to about 1500 feet, then darted up and seemed to explode, casting off fragments of sparks. No sound. Altitude-Velocity very rapid. No trail.
9. CONCLUSIONS    As the object was sighted only by one individual, who is not deemed a completely reliable observer, the sighting could not be very definitely evaluated. It appears to have been some type of natural phenomenon, possibly a meteor or bolide. There is no evidence that it was an aircraft or unidentified flying object.
