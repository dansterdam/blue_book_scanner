SUBJECT: LIF Report - 4 March 1965
DATE: 9 March 1965
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler
CHAIRMAN: NICAP Massachusetts Investigating Subcommittee
TO: NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Attention: Richard Hall
C.C.: USAF (AFX-2T)
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

Gentlemen:
I enclose a LIF report which has been tentatively identified as a "huge fireball." It is sent to you "for information purposes" in the event that other data might be submitted relating it to a genuine UFO.

I am in contact with the "Moonwatch" program at Smithsonian Observatory and have received additional information from them pending their possible receipt of other reports regarding this sighting. The observer feels certain that the object was not a reflection on his automobile windshield. Although he has seen large meteors before, he never has witnessed anything as large as the object he observed last night.

Please forward a copy of this report from NICAP to Dr. Charles Clivfer, NICAP Board member.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler
NICAP Investigator
