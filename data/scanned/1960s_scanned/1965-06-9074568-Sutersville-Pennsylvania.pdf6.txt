Sighted a satellite in the north-west at approximately 8:50 PM on June 5, 1965. The object was observed traveling in a northeasterly direction at an estimated speed of 15-20 minutes per degree. It appeared to be brightly lit and after several minutes it disappeared into the haze. I have no explanation for what this object may have been.
