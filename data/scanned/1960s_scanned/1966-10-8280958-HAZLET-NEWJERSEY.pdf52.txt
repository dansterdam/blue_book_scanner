During the duration of the light, several people in the town felt definitely that we observed a small craft or object come toward out of the sky and hover near the area at an altitude of about 60 to 75 feet, and then ascend straight up at a very rapid rate of speed. When we observed this object it appeared to be a bright light at the intensity of the city lights and seemed to be a metallic color with a kind of glow around its edges. When we started to approach the object, it began to move rapidly upward out of sight. We felt definitely that we had observed and experienced a real phenomenon that could not be explained by any natural causes.
