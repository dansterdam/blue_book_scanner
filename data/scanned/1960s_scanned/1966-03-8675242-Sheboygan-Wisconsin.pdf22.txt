The flight this witness observed was a strange and unusual phenomenon. When we got down to the sight we could see it apparently hovering just off the ground and then executing a radical change in course and speed, it all the lights as depicted in drawing on page were not flashing but were steadily. The witness stated that the shaleness of the sight would lead one to believe that all the people on the street at their homes gaping at it, or not apparen[tly] aware were not nearly so excited about the peculiar nature of this sight as we were. This was really the only people we saw on the street at their homes gaping at the strange and startling nature of this phenomenon, which not only have [not] been completely explained but was not fully realized by the people observing the affair to the extent that we were. This time the sights were flashing in a irregular fashion.
