Morristown, N.J.

Dear sir,

I'm the officer in charge of the "Dallas, Texas" sighting on March 16, 1964. Some of the details of this sighting indicate an anomalous situation of more than passing interest. This case has received careful study and has been placed in category "A" as a situation worthy of further investigation. However, I'm hesitant to go into the details of this case in this initial letter without first learning more about your specific interest and purpose. If you would care to outline your interest and purpose, I'll be happy to provide you with the details of the "Dallas, Texas" sighting and the conclusions reached by Project Blue Book. I'll be looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
