The image appears to contain three sketches or drawings. The first sketch shows a curved horizon line with an object above it, and instructions to place an "A" on the curve to indicate where the object was first seen and a "B" on the same curve to indicate where the object was last seen. The second sketch appears to show a wider landscape view with a figure in the center and some geometric shapes. The third sketch shows a narrow, cone-shaped object.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this larger sketch.
