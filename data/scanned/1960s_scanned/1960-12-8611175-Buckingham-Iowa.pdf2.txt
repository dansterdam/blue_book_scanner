The image does not contain a photograph, but rather two sketches. The first sketch shows an object high above the horizon, and the second sketch shows a larger sketch of the object's position when it was first seen.

The text in the document is as follows:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the sky where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the sky to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this.
