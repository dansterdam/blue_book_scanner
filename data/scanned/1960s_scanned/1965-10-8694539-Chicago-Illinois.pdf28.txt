MORE CLOSE SIGHTINGS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE: On October 22nd, at least two very good sightings were made in New Hampshire. The first by a man named Oscar - "Tall man, in his forties, with gray hair..."He wrote to the newspapers to call the second an "enormous flying object over the farmstead" Shovted - "When he saw it, the bright flying object was over the farmstead. Shaped like a football, it gave off a greenish glow through its transparent sides and seemed to be about 50 feet long. He said it was disc-shaped, and glowed red, while the rounded sides were a bright glow." 
Five minutes later, the object left, travelling at a terrific rate of speed. The other man, "a little olderman", was driving on Rockrimack St., when he saw a similar bright light moving very rapidly through the sky. He almost had a collision with his car when the mysterious object finally stopped almost directly over him. Suddenly it took off at an unbelievable rate of speed and vanished. The object is said to have three bright green lights set in a triangular pattern about 20 to 30 feet across. It also had a red light. All the lights could be clearly seen against the dark sky. From time to time the object would suddenly move away rapidly, in a southerly direction. There was no sound except a "hissing" noise like that of a steam coming out of a radiator valve.
