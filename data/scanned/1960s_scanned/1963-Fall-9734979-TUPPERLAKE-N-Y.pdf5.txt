Dear

Enclosed is the photograph with negative which you furnished to the Air Force for analysis.

A laboratory analysis indicates a positive explanation for this light phenomenon. The light appears to be caused by the reflection of the moon on the surface of the lake, which would in all probability result in the formation caused.

We are returning your photograph and negative as you requested.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
