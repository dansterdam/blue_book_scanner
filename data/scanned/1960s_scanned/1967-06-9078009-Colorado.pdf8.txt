UFO Observation, June 18, 1967

1. Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs of June 15, 1967. The results of photo analysis of your negative are as follows:

a. Examination of the photography reveals that the three images in question are apparently photographic phenomena. Noting that the nature of the phenomena is such that it is decreasing in size, distance and reflection, the images appear to the rear of the photographer, being reflected on the window. Since the photographic phenomena produces no discernible detail, objects from outside may be the actual targets rather than the unidentified flying objects moved slowly, as it is not reasonable to assume that the character of the image were due to the actual objects. The photographic image seems rather to be merely reflections or distortions of objects off-axis to the camera range. The image forming light is then equated to an object distance of less than 6 inches' camera focal length. This then equates to an object distance of approximately 6 feet from the camera (when photographing through a window). This indicates the real objects (or reflections) are off-axis to the camera, and the near theory which locates the actual objects outside the train, appears to be confirmed.
