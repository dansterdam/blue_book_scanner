WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, MISSOURI 
AUGUST 6, 1965 
STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN WINSTON M. ANDERSON, RADAR OPERATOR, AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SECTION, 550TH TACTICAL CONTROL SQUADRON, WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, MISSOURI.

ON 6 AUGUST 1965, AT APPROXIMATELY 2200 HOURS, I WAS ON DUTY IN THE RADAR ROOM OF THE AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SECTION, 550TH TACTICAL CONTROL SQUADRON, WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, MISSOURI. WHILE PERFORMING ROUTINE RADAR OPERATIONS, I OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED TARGET ON THE RADAR SCREEN. THE TARGET APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, WITH A DIAMETER OF APPROXIMATELY ONE HALF MILE. THE TARGET MOVED ERRATICALLY AT A SPEED ESTIMATED TO BE IN EXCESS OF 1000 KNOTS.

I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE OFFICER IN CHARGE, CAPTAIN STEPHEN C. GARDNER, WHO ALSO OBSERVED THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGET ON THE RADAR SCREEN. CAPTAIN GARDNER CONCURRED WITH MY OBSERVATIONS AND ORDERED ME TO TRACK THE TARGET AND NOTIFY THE COMMAND POST.

THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGET WAS TRACKED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME IT MADE SEVERAL ABRUPT CHANGES IN DIRECTION AND ALTITUDE. THE TARGET THEN DISAPPEARED FROM THE RADAR SCREEN, APPARENTLY DUE TO A COMPLETE LOSS OF SIGNAL.

I HAVE READ THE ABOVE STATEMENT AND IT IS TRUE AND CORRECT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF.

CAPTAIN WINSTON M. ANDERSON
