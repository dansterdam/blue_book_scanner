The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. As instructed, I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document.

The text visible in the image is:

"EXHIBIT "A"

AT HIGH       G-SHROUDED "D"
