SIGHTING : MAN BURNED BY FLYING SAUCER IN GEORGIA: A thoroughly frightening occurrence was reported by Galene Nash in her article of June 29th. 1964, in a North Carolina magazine. A young man who was parked along a highway had a flying saucer descend upon his car, and a beam of light struck him, severely burning him.

According to the report, the young man's automobile stalled, and he saw a brilliantly lighted object hovering about 70 feet above him. The object descended rapidly, and a beam of light was directed at him, burning him severely. He was able to restart his car and drive off, but the UFO followed him for a considerable distance, and gave off terrific heat.

Parhaps said that he could remember nothing more about the incident than that it was terrifying and that he felt intense heat. There were ground markings found on the spot where the incident occurred, and tire marks were found as well. The heat from the UFO was so intense that it scorched the ground in one direction only.
