There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing text only.

that a very sizable temperature inversion was present, and this was a simple to magnify some of the radar and optical effects. The radar, moving as it is, might have been some secondary reflection from the ground and the shine might have been some additional reflection from the stars, and deciding that it moved with reference to those stars? Sounds that might have been indications unless this motion was really very sizable.

One further question that we have. A study of the Whitted case indicates that the UFO was merely a mirage. Apparently this was a considered conclusion in the early days. We wonder why it is that the presence of the real object was not considered, and why the image alone was considered to be the UFO.

Thank you for the additional sightings, all of which are useful and lend frankness to the book. Also, I think you were going to send us one from the south, where a missile operation reported not only sighting, but photography, according to your observation, was due to forest fire or oil well fire, or something of the sort.

Again, with our many thanks and best wishes, I am

Cordially yours,

P.S. I'm scheduled to be in Washington on July 26. If time permits, I may run over to the Pentagon and talk with you some at that time.
