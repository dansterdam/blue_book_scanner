BACKGROUND:
I received a telephone call from a Mr. X of Leominster, Mass. The caller reported that on the night of March 8, 1967, he had observed a semi-circular object over the Leominster region on the local sighting which was overlooked by our newsclip service. The object in question had reported the incident to NICAP's regional director in the area, and phoned to inform me about the sighting.

ACCOUNT: 
The witness, a Mr. and Mrs. X, were returning to their home after a dinner party. The weather was crystal clear, except for a localized pocket of what appeared to be ground fog or mist in the Leominster region. As they approached the cemetery, they observed a large light to their left over the cemetery (approx. 1/4 mile). The object was hovering and gave off a pulsating light. The said that she had not seen anything so turned around and drove down and drove off the road towards the cemetery and the light. As they drove closer the object rose higher and went down the road broadside to the cemetery and the light.

1) The automobile lights, radio and engine ceased functioning.
2) He felt an electrical shock and his body became numb and immobilized.
