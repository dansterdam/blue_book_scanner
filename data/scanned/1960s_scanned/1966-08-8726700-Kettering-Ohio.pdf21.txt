The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

(1) sounding a siren call to R.F.C.
(1) northeast
(2) flight paths and direction and
(3) Daylight time indicator of when the object was observed. The duration of the sighting was approximately 3 minutes. This object was observed at 9:50 pm. This object was observed to move at a very high speed, estimated to be around 2000 mph. It appears to have come from the east and gone west.

I would not send a second and final report because I do not have enough information to prepare one with the First Jones sighting.
