The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved trajectory of an object in the sky, with instructions to mark the point where the object was first seen as "A" and the point where the object had moved to as "B". The second sketch shows a wider landscape view, with a person standing on a road and some buildings in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the position when you last saw it.
