Produced text from the document:

Wording was similar to this as the observer said he was "watching something in the sky which was moving in a zig-zag pattern" and that "it was traveling at a great speed and zig-zagging as it went along." The observer said that he watched this object for several minutes and that it seemed to be at about 1,000 feet altitude. He said that it made no sound that he could hear and that it appeared to be oblong in shape. The observer also said that as the object moved, it seemed to flash or blink at intervals. He said that later the object seemed to go into the distance and disappear from view. The observer reported this incident to the proper authorities and a thorough investigation was made. It was concluded that the observer had in fact seen an unidentified flying object and that his report was believed to be authentic.
