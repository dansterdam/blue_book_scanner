Transcription of the text in the image:

Immediately after reporting the sighting, this witness again became aware of the presence of the object, this time somewhat closer and more distinct. Its general outline appeared to be elongated, but no details were discernible. The object remained stationary for a few minutes, then began a gradual climb and acceleration. The acceleration was rapid and the object disappeared from view in the direction of the northeast. The witness stated that he was familiar with various types of aircraft and this object was unlike anything he had ever seen. It seemed to be traveling at a very high rate of speed when it disappeared from view. The witness was certain that the object was not any known type of aircraft or celestial body. He felt that the object was under intelligent control, due to its rapid acceleration and disappearance. He reported his sighting to the proper authorities and was interviewed by representatives of Project Blue Book.
