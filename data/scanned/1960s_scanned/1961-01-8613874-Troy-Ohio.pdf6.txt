Finally, it is conceivable that the being and the craft were deliberately trying to conceal themselves from observation. The craft seemed to vanish into a zone of foliage and darkness. Because of the time of night and the remote location, there were no others who could confirm the sighting. The matter could not be investigated further. This is unfortunately the nature of many UFO incidents, where evidence is fleeting and eyewitness accounts are the only record of the event. Reliable data is difficult to obtain. And so the occurrence stands as another unexplained phenomenon, leaving more questions than answers.
