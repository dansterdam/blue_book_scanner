35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific point
questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

This sighting appears to be related to a UFO incident. The witness describes seeing an object that was white and luminous, with no wings or visible lights. The object was seen moving erratically and descending with a "darting" motion. The witness also mentions that the object made no sound. This information does not appear to be fully covered by the standard questionnaire form, so the witness has provided a narrative explanation. No photographs or other visual evidence seem to be included in this particular report.
