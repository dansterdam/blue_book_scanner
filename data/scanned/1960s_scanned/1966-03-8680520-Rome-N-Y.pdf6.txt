The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, specifically the case file for a report made on March 8, 1966 in Rome, New York.

The text in the document is as follows:

7- Identifying information on observer:
a. Civilian: 
Name -------
AGE
Mailing Address G. Webster
Occupation Fire, Chief, Signal Corp

b. Military:
Name

Duty
Estimate of Reliability

8. Comments of reporting officer: 
a. Action taken (agencies called, etc.) 
b. Final evaluation (accuracy, reliability, timeliness, etc.)
The content suggests this is an incident report form with sections for identifying the civilian observer and any military personnel involved, as well as comments from the reporting officer on the actions taken and the final evaluation of the report.
