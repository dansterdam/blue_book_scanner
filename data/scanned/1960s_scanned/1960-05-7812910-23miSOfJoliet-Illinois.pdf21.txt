FEB - 6 1967

Dear Sir:

Reference your letter of January 6, 1967 reporting a 1960 unidentified flying object (UFO) observation.

At such late date, a comprehensive study would be extremely difficult, since records of air activity have normally deteriorated to a point where it would be impossible to determine the actual stimuli. The information will be filed and added to the present data base.

Your interest in our program is appreciated.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.
