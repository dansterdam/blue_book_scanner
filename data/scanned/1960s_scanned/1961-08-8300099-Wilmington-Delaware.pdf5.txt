At a little after 9:00 P.M. on August 4, 1961, the witness saw the most startling phenomenon he had ever witnessed. The witness was out in his back yard when he noticed a flash of light in the eastern sky. He watched as the light moved in a horizontal direction, then started to move up and down rapidly. The light seemed to increase and decrease in size as it moved up and down. It then seemed to stop momentarily, and then started to zig-zag back and forth. The witness said the zig-zag motion was very fast, and the light seemed to change colors, going from white to red to blue. After a few minutes, the light seemed to start fading, and then suddenly disappeared. The witness said he was greatly puzzled by what he had seen, and had no explanation for the strange light in the sky. He said he had never seen anything like it before, and that it was a most unusual and startling experience.
