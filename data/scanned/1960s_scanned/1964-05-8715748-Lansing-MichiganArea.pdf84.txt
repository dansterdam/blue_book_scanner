reported during the personal interview. The similarity in brightness and color had misled them.

P-1 watch at the crater point had been on a line of flight passing through both craters, then no horizontal triangulation is possible. Elevation angles estimates are too uncertain to permit estimates.

This is a probability, the object may have been a fact, bright, meteor, a fireball, far to the south and may miles high. If so, it could have been seen in northern central Indiana, and would have been brightest advisors over the Indiana-Michigan border.

The object seen could not have been the same as the one reported by the anonymous caller to have been "over her house," because the day's haze was somewhere between a thin and thick veil, no definite identification is possible on this latter object.

7. _____________, 205 Broadway, Bay City, Michigan, called this investigator to report that he had seen a light at 0030 moving almost directly overhead, from west to east, taking approximately five minutes to cross the sky from horizon to horizon. The object, which made no noise, was half the brightness of Jupiter, and every now and then wavered in direction. This, he said, is the wavering being a practically universal optical illusion, people often imagine an object has a small oscillating motion on questioning, it turned out that he did not actually try to see the object through the telescope.

Witness, for a student at n.i.u. par city in about 300 miles northeast of Lansing: At 2300, 25 May 1964, ______________ Fire Chief of the Delta county Fire Department (located in Escanada, Michigan) was awakened by a loud rumbling noise, which sounded very close. He turned on the house lights and went outside to investigate. He saw a bright round object, larger than the full moon, hovering silently at about 250 feet altitude above his house. It was described as being surrounded by a bluish-white glow, with a distinct line of demarcation between the glow and the object itself. The object remained stationary for about a minute, then accelerated rapidly in a northerly direction and disappeared from sight in 5-10 seconds.
