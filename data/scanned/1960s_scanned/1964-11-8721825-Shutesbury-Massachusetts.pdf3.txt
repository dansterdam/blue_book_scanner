Orange Disc in Massachusetts
Mrs. Harriet E. Smith of Shutesbury, Mass., reported seeing an orange disc-shaped object which she observed for about 10 minutes as it traveled from the southwest to the northeast at 5:55 p.m. on November 13, 1964. The object appeared to be about 60 feet in diameter.

A spokesman at Westover AFB said he received an inquiry about a UFO sighting on the morning of November 13. He called Flight Operations but that section reported no information on the sighting. The FAA for further investigation said the sighting was detailed in the Westover AFB files but they had no additional information.

The object was also seen by Reverend Hess, a resident of West Suffield, Conn., reported his sighting which took place at the same time.

Reverend Hess was looking west from his home when he saw a brightly lighted object. He said he could not get a full view because he had to observe it through trees branches. He observed it for about 3 or 4 minutes and said it moved.

On Friday, November 13, Mrs. Smith said the object and one of the residents of West Suffield, Conn., in addition to herself, observed the object at about 5:55 p.m. at a point about 40 miles south by southwest of Shutesbury. It is possible that the object seen by Reverend Hess and Mrs. Smith was the same object, but their accounts contained minor differences in describing what they observed during its flight.
