DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
CHANGE AS IT DISAPPEARED?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
HAVE A SMOOTH MOTION (TROUBLE-FREE)?
WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
I don't know much about the incident.
HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
I don't know the answer, but it  simply disappeared.
DID IT SEEM TO MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
It seemed to move behind the horizon, but came right back on view as new.
