OFFICE - SECRETARY,
MATS DIV,
WASH. D.C. 20330
19 APR 1967
Dear I -
Further reference is made to your letter of 21 Mar 67 concerning the UFO sighting report submitted by Captain Clarence M. Chiles and Lt. John B. Whitted, for the 24 Jul 1948 incident in the vicinity of Montgomery, Alabama.
The information contained in your letter has been carefully reviewed, and after consideration of all the facts, it has been determined that the incident does not warrant reopening of the case. The conclusion reached at the time was that the object sighted was most likely a meteor or other natural phenomenon. This opinion, based on the facts available, remains unchanged.
I trust this additional information is helpful. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact this office.
Sincerely,
Project Blue Book Officer"
