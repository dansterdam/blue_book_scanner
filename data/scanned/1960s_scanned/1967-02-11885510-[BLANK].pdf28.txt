There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image shows text that appears to be a technical discussion about the challenges in detecting and receiving signals from extraterrestrial hydrogen wavelengths using radio astronomy techniques.

universal meaning and actually used in the Ozma project is 
objected to by many scientists both East and West.  The reason 
for this is the abundance of interstellar hydrogen which places 
the high threshold of radio noise exactly in this line.
The choice of the wavelength for communication is, of course, 
badly restricted by the known properties of the earth's atmosphere. 
Moreover, it is equally restricted by the unknown properties of 
other bodies' atmospheres.  It is easy to imagine a planetary 
atmosphere suitable for life having argon instead of nitrogen 
which would radically change its transmission properties.
Perhaps the most thorough discussion of this problem was 
given by Kotel'nikov in the Byurakan Symposium (pp 113-120).  The 
hydrogen wavelength 21 cm is assumed to be impractical for the 
above-mentioned reasons.  He proposes a multi-channel receiver 
containing a large number of narrow-band filters.  If a mono- 
chromatic signal of a certain frequency reaches the antenna it 
will be automatically recorded and an appropriate channel tuned 
to that frequency.
Even with this device the coverage of the whole sky is not 
an easy undertaking.  Assuming a limiting distance of 1,000 light 
years, the number of stars in this space will be of the order of 
10 million.  To cover the whole sky including all these stars 
will take exactly one year utilizing antennas and recorders 
recommended by Kotel'nikov.  Further, what guarantee is there
