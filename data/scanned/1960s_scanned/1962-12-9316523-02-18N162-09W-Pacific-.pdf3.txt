Saucer lands in Italy
In the early hours of the 18th of December 1962, a fisherman on duty in the province of a suburban sector in Milan, Italy, reported to police that he had observed a strange, bright light land in a nearby field. The light, which resembled a large saucer-shaped object, had a center cone structure and emitted a bluish glow around the rim. According to the fisherman, a small man emerged from the craft and walked around the perimeter of the object for a few minutes. The man then re-entered the craft which then rapidly took off and disappeared over the horizon. An official investigation will be initiated on this incident when more details are received.
