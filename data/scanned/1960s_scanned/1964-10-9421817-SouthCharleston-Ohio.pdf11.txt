"FREE LANCE PHOTOGRAPHER
South Charleston, Ohio
Dec. 22, 1964

Dear Sir:

Wednesday afternoon I called your office to check with you concerning a negative containing U.F.O.s which I sent to you a few weeks ago.
A Sergeant took the call. The conversation with him gave me the opinion that it was some kind of 'trick photography'. Major, I wish this was true, there is actual reality in this incident. The Sergeant knows very little about photography. I am too busy with my work to play around with a negative just to 'trick' someone. Seriously I don't believe any photographer could do that. It would be impossible to do. 

I thought, maybe it could have been done in England where the film was made, but after checking the print again I noticed the one object going through the air seemed to vanished off on both sides allowing it to slide through. This, to me cleared the company.

Another factor that I was concerned about was at the bottom part of the negative, which has a margin. Exposure may be caused if the object recorded this the object had to penetrate the wood part of the film holder which made the margin.

You keep the negative until your investigation is completed. But keep one thing in mind that this is not 'trick photography' on my part. All I wish is you will be able to clear this thing up. If it cannot be explained please tell me so. I will then release it to news agencies.

Sincerely,"
