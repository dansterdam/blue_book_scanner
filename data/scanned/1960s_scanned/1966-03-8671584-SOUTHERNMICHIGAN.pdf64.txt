proceeded towards the glowing along a path marked by a dotted line (a path which I almost exactly repeated on Wednesday, 23 March in the company of Deputy Fitzpatrick and Airman Kelley, to point D).

From point D, Deputy Fitzpatrick observed a glow emitting from point marked G. Point G is also indicated on a map of the region. 

Points A, B G & M are also indicated on figure 2. Deputy Fitzpatrick reported that the glow reported at G brightened and dimmed slowly. "It was thought stage lights were being brightened and dimmed." Deputy Fitzpatrick never observed anything other than a glow. He did not even observe the glow to rise to the tree top level as Manor and his son indicated it had.

While Deputy McFadden busied himself in another direction in the swamp. Deputy Fitzpatrick proceeded towards the glow. The deputies were informed that the flashlights were visible to Mr Manor and his son who said had now returned to the farm and were observing the deputies search from afar. Deputy Fitzpatrick stated to me that as he and his flashlight approached the glow, the source was apparently hidden by a slight rise in the terrain, the glow disappeared. 

Deputy Fitzpatrick did not see it again. He reported that the glow disappeared rather than faded, so he was convinced that the glow had not been an ordinary source of light.
