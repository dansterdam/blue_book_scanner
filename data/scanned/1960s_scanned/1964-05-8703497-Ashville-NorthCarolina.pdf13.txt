The text emphasizes that the reports are made in confidence and the author does not wish to disclose any names unless absolutely necessary.

Text from the document:

All these students are very honest. This was not made up for PUBLICITY because we have no intention of having this published. Before you is a true report of the happenings. If you wish I will send to you any other reports if there any more. I am inclined to think that there will be, due to these constant sightings. Many reports have been given to me in confidence and I do not wish to disclose any names unless you feel, for some reason,that it is necessary. Please do not say anything to any of the students here at school except those involved. We feel that this would not accomplish anything but might produce unnecessary feeling among the student body and those involved. Just for the record, one matter knows about it but will keep it in confidence. Please reply to me if you have some explanation or something else to offer. We will remain to keep this quiet for several obvious reasons.

Yours truly,
