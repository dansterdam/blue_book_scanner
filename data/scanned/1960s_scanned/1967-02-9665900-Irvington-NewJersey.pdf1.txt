PROJECT 10279 RECORD
2. LOCATION Irvington, New Jersey
10. CONCLUSION: Probable "HOT AIR BALLOON"
Description is consistent with those of a hot air carriot balloon.
11. CHIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers witnessed a bright light which was found to be a hot air balloon that had an electronic device attached and was some distance from which the observers were located. This was a similar object from which the observers thought they had seen earlier, but upon closer examination was found to be a hot air balloon and not an unidentified flying object.
