On 3 Feb. 1965, at about 1800 hours, the witness, a resident of Brooksville, Florida, reported sighting an unidentified flying object NW of his home. The object was first seen hovering about 2000 feet up and moving slowly in a northerly direction. It then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight.

The witness described the object as cigar-shaped, about 30 feet long, and colored white. No sound was heard. The sky was clear at the time.

The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes. The witness, who has had previous experience observing aircraft, could not identify the object as any known type of aircraft.
