The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather a hand-drawn sketch or diagram. The sketch appears to depict some kind of object or unidentified flying object (UFO) with the text "110 second lights" written above it. There are also some handwritten notes below the sketch, but the text is partially obscured and difficult to make out in detail.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

110 second lights
Dayt it was in view long enough to get
a distinct outline
Seen at 2:50 a.m. Short
duration of 90 seconds duration 0110
rising into visibility and descending 
into obscurity
