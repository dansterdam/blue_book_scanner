"attacks of newspaper clippings, which he had purchased at his own expense, and his maps, and I, at least, am convinced that the reports are real; that is, that the reports do exist as much in various french newspapers on these dates.  I firmly believe that hoax and a deliberate attempt to concoct a cock and bull story must be ruled out.  It would save us much bother and worry if we could take this way out, namely to say that Michel manufactured the reports out of thin air and wrote the book just to make money.  From the returns he has had, I might say in passing that his latest must have been done, as public wages.  

In any event I feel reasonably certain that some stimulus existed in France--whether political, scientific, extra-terrestrial, meteorological, or psychological--that in the space of two months generated several hundreds of reports, reports which show a definite thread of pattern.  So, with this preamble, let us travel to France, in the late summer, 1954.  The curtain apparently went up on this fantastic show on August 23, at 1:00 a.m., 40 miles northwest of Paris.  A businessman had just put his car away, and as he came out of the garage he was surprised to see a pale light illuminating the town which had been in complete darkness a little while before.  The night was completely clear and the moon was at last quarter, and hence very faint."
