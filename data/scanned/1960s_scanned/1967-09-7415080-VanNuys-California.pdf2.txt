TEST/UFO (Mj) Quintanilla/70916/mhs/29 Sep 67)
UFO Observation, September 21, 1957

Van Nuys, California 91406

1. Reference your letter of September 22, 1967 regarding your observation of September 21. Your sighting was probably caused by missile which was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base at approximate time of your observation. Missile contrails can sometimes be seen for extremely long distances. These unusual formations produced by light passing through the vapor trail of the missile are not by a missile blowing up.

2. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
