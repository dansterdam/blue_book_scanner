Dear Sirs:
The enclosed sets of pictures were snapped by me as I sat in my station wagon at Weehawken Park, N.J. These sets were made while parked at "Wreck Pond" in Spring Lake, N.J. on Feb. 20th, 1965. One set of photos was snapped at Moonmouth Airport, as the object appeared over the airfield. Although I passed the photos to you, I hope you are going to turn your investigations to the sightings themselves.
The photos and let me know just what they may reveal to you - as I passed by. and were also visible to the naked eye.(At least to my unaided eye.!)
Hoping the enclosed is of interest and envelopers do as you can return the pictures to as after examining same - if you care to make your findings available. please do so.
Sincerely,
[Blackened out name]
