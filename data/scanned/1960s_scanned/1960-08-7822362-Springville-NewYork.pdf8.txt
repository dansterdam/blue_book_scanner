CASE FILE NO. 7822362
LOCATION: SPRINGVILLE, NEW YORK
DATE: AUGUST 7, 1960

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
At approximately 10:35 PM on August 7, 1960, several observers reported sighting a bright, oval-shaped object in the sky over Springville, New York. The object was described as hovering and performing sudden, erratic maneuvers before accelerating and rapidly disappearing from view.

WITNESS ACCOUNTS:
According to the witness statements, the object appeared to be metallic in nature and emitted a bright, pulsating light. It was estimated to be approximately 50-75 feet in diameter and hovered silently at an altitude of around 2,000 feet. The object then suddenly accelerated and climbed rapidly, disappearing from sight within seconds.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
No physical evidence or photographic documentation was obtained during this incident. However, the attached diagram appears to be a radar plot or other technical data related to the reported sighting. The diagram shows an unidentified target exhibiting unusual flight characteristics, including rapid acceleration and abrupt changes in direction.

CONCLUSION:
This case remains unresolved. The witness accounts and technical data suggest the presence of an unidentified aerial phenomenon, but without additional physical evidence, the exact nature and origin of the object cannot be conclusively determined. The case has been classified as an "unidentified" in the Project Blue Book archives.
