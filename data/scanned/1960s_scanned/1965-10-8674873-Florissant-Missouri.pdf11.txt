The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch that appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The sketch shows a diagram with angular measurements and instructions for the observer, but no human faces are visible.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Please a "C" on the object to show where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. (may you could a perfect right angle turn.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 2. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
