Dear Major Friend:

Under separate cover I am sending you the film and find that I took this past
of file interview mentioning minutes into which I previously thought I had taken.

On Friday March 6, 1960 at approximately 8:55 P.M. my wife and I at our home
were watching a few aircraft fly overhead when suddenly I noticed what appeared
to be three bright objects maneuvering, and as they disappeared, we started to
be excited very slightly.

The objects were about the size of a quarter's approximately 2.0 miles distant
and moving at a considerably high rate of speed, approximately 2.5 or 3 miles
an minute. We were about five miles from the objects so I estimate they were
about 25 degrees above the horizon.

The objects did not give off smoke or any vapor trail, they appeared solid,
bright and did not appear to be aircraft, birds or anything else we are familiar
with. The objects were sharply defined and were three of them.

Below is a diagram of the objects that we saw.

Sincerely,
