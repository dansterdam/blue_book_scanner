Dear Mrs. 

Your letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been referred to the United States Air Force for reply. We are deeply sorry for the delay in answering your letter.

The time-all series you refer to are what. I propose from the available evidence they were probably experiments conducted by the Government and again they would not permit the aircraft to pass undetected. These radar returns which indicated a small object resembling an aircraft. These radar returns indicate that an unnatural phenomena took place in your vicinity. The radar returns were valid enough to mandate tracing the aircraft's flight and photograph, if possible, but we could not permit the aircraft to pass undetected.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM A. LOCKRIDGE
