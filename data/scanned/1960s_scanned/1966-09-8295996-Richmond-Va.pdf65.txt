CLOUDS TAKE ON COLORS

WALIOPS ISLAND, V». Sept. S.— A rigid inspection, scientific instrumen's appar from the sky and were subjected to. It was the Navy's opinion that the clouds look strangs and varied colors as they developed during the firing of an experimental rocket.
The National Aeronautics and Space AdminiSL/ation at Wallops Island conducted a thorough study of the unusual cloud formations and the strange colors which appeared to result from the experimental firing. A scientific report was prepared at the conclusion of the study, which was made at the request of the Navy's Office of Naval Research.
The report indicates that the sky took on strange and varied colors, with unusual cloud formations, as a result of the experimental firing. It appears that the exhaust of the rocket produced chemical reactions in the cloud formations, resulting in the varied colors. The full scientific report has not been made public at this time.
