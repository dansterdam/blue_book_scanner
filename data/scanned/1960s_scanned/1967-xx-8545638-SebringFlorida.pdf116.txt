Also: Triangle-shaped object moved with its blunt end or base toward and its pointed end or apex trailing. Area was open countryside; Meat, vegetables and milk had frozen solid.(This was attributed to the UFO as an 'extreme change in temperature or energy was released in the day the refrigerators were thawing. Investigators concluded it could have been a coincidence).

Investigators were impressed with sincerity and seeming validity of witnesses and the sighting. Also, no follow-up of other alleged witnesses was attempted. Mr. Rogelund of the Sprinfield Mass. Planetarium had obtained the investigators and provided to send NICAP any results of this value of photographic cooperation. All-in-all, probably a good sighting. The Air Force was pleased with details provided in NICAP-CONN report and no further follow-up could be made. If negative are significant, follow-up by NICAP-CONN would be desirable.
