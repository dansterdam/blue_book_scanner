REARDON, WASHINGTON UFO SIGHTING OF 13 & 14 JAN. 1961

Several people were observing strange lights in the sky. The lights were described as being similar to those observed during the previous flight of a helicopter. One witness stated that the lights were similar to flares. However, an investigation was made by the reporting agency, and it was determined that the lights were not from a helicopter, and it was determined that the lights were not flares. The lights were moving and it was determined that the lights were not standard aircraft lights or flares.

It is therefore concluded that the lights observed by the witnesses were not those of a helicopter or flares, and as a result this is considered an unidentified flying object sighting.
