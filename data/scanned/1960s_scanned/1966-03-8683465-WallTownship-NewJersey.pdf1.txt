2. LOCATION: Wall Township, New Jersey
3. SOURCE: (1 Witness)
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: Southerly
8. PHOTOS: None

10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer noticed an object that came out of the clouds and leveled off and stopped in mid-air. It sounded like an air-pressure or hissing sound. The object came from the south and after pausing for a while, made a "Z" turn and sped off again in a southerly direction. Without essential data such as camera data and focal length, further analysis is not warranted.
