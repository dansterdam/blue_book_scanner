Light had to be stopped to take a look at the two "lights", could not ascertain from same any size or kind, distant, how long they appeared or disappeared were not known. When they disappeared, same as when they appeared, no unusual loot, just gone after 5 minutes-fair and clear vision. Sounds were all above sounds or objects.

This refers to an observation of two unidentified lights in the sky that appeared and disappeared suddenly, with no unusual sounds or sightings other than the lights themselves. The observer could not determine their size, distance, or duration. The sighting lasted for around 5 minutes under clear conditions.
