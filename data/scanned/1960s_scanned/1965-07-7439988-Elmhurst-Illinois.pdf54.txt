BACKGROUND: The sighting of this particular sighting appeared in the 31 July issue of the Elmhurst PRESS & REVIEW. This object was sighted by the witness and a friend while they were driving along Route 83 in Elmhurst, Illinois. The object appeared as a brilliant light in the sky, at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet, moving at a rapid rate of speed. The witness estimated the size of the object to be about 50 feet in diameter. It was observed for a period of approximately 10-15 seconds.

DESCRIPTION: A brilliant light object was observed, about 50 feet in diameter, moving at a rapid rate of speed at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet.
