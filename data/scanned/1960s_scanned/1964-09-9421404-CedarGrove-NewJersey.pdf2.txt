Dear Dr. Hynek,

We have completed the evaluations of the September 1964 cases. The sightings submitted for investigation and re-evaluation have been carefully studied. The reports indicate that no further definitive conclusions can be drawn in these two cases.

We are now working with the July and August sightings and will forward the evaluations as soon as possible.

Hoping to hear from you on the January to June 1964 cases.

Sincerely,

DAVID WEBB
