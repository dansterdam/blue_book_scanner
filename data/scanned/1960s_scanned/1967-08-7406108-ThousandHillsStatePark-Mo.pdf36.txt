STARLING, FOR THE 729TH RADAR SQUADRON LOCATED AT KIRKSVILLE AFS,
MO. SAYS AIRCRAFT 421-491L COMPUTED IS DUE TO THE DELAY IN REPORTING
NO CHECK WAS MADE TO TRY TO SIGHT THE OBJECTS. THE REPORT COMES
FROM A PERMANENT FAMILY AND BOTH WOMEN WERE POSITIVE ON WHAT THEY
SAW. AND THAT IS ALMOST EVERY POINT. THERE WAS A SMALL AIRCRAFT
IN THE AREA WHICH THEY TRIED TO COMPARE WITH UFO. BUT NOSE
FROM THE AIRCRAFT AND MOTOR BOATS PREVENTED THEM FROM HEARING ANY
SOUND.
