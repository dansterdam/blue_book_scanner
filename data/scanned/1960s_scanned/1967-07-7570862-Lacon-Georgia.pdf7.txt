5. Evaluation:
(1) This case appears to meet the criteria and procedures for official recording of a UFO sighting.
(2) While the observer was confident that he could see no material substance or other identifying characteristics of the object, he could not explain satisfactorily what he saw. The observer reported that the object appeared to accelerate rapidly from his field of view, and that this speed and maneuver ruled out any conventional aircraft or astronomical phenomenon. As the information provided is incomplete, other explanations may not be available.
