The image contains two sketches/illustrations. The first sketch is a compass rose with instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction of a UFO sighting. The second sketch depicts two landscape scenes, one showing a person standing in a valley between two hills, and the other showing a person standing on a hilltop overlooking a valley.

As an OCR system, I will now output all the text found in the document:
