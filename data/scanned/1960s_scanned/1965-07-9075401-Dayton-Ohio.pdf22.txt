EASLA NG BUT (4506)
FLYING SAUCERS
BY JERRY DUKE, WRITER
ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER
ACCORDING TO CAP - SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAY THEY ARE 
SEEING MORE IN SUMMER SKIES THAN BUZZING INSECTS AND BIRDS ON
THE GROUND.
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ENGLAND CAFE REPORTS OF FLYING OBJECTS
OBJECTS FLASHING THROUGH SPACE AND SPACE AND INTERFERING
WITH ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT, AND TWO ALIENS REMAINING OUTSIDE
THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST
TWO WEEKS REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED IN WHAT CAUSED A COWITOTION FROM OHIO TO
MARYLAND TURNED OUT TO BE A RUNAWAY NAVY BALLOON LAUNCHED IN CANADA.
WHAT DO THESE OBJECTS HAVE IN COMMON? NOTHING, SAY SKEPTICS.
ONE MAN IN ENGLAND SAID HIS DAUGHTER'S PLAYING CARDS WERE REPORTED SIGHTINGS
TO DATE SINCE 1947, HE SAYS THEY'RE USUALLY BALLOONS, BIRDS SEARCHLIGHTS,
CHATTERING BATS AND ONCE IN A BLUE MOON, SOME REALLY-LIT OBJECTS BY YOUR NEIGHBORS!
TO DATE  THE AIR FORCE SAID ONLY 667 REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED AND
MOST OF THESE APPARENTLY HAVE LOGICAL EXPLANATIONS.A FEW MORE INFORMATION
WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO INVESTIGATORS LATER
BILLIARD'S SAID HEYSEN HOWEVER HAS ENCOUNTERED CASES WHICH HE SAYS REMAINS
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE INDICATE THE OBJECTS CAME FROM OUTER SPACE.
THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND
SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS IS THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE FROM SOME
ADVANCED CIVILIZATION A SAFE DISTANCE AWAY. THE SAME CONCLUSION YEARS
AGO, BUT ON THIS LEVEL POLICY OF EXPLAINING THE SIGHTINGS AWAY
WE HAVE ANOTHER SET OF THINGS THEY'RE THAT FAR BEHIND IN EUROPE JULY 7.
IT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING," SAID MRS. DORA HORLOCK, WHO, WITH
HER HUSBAND, SPOTTED ONE OF THESE OBJECTS IN THE SOUTHERN SKY NEAR
WAR ROCHESTER, ENGLAND.
THAT SAME NIGHT IN VALENSOLE, FRANCE, MAURICE MASSE SAID HE SAW
THAT LANDED CLOSE BY. HE DESCRIBED IT AS RESEMBLING A LARGE FOOTBALL. 
WITH FOUR METAL LESS AND A DOME. "I DON'T THINK WHAT I SAW WAS EARTHLY,"
HE SAID.
THE OBJECTS THAT WERE SIGHTED, OUR CONSULTANTS SAY, CHANGING TO GREEN AND
YELLOW, CHAPEAU OBJECT-YELLOWISH RED, CHANGING TO GREEN AND YELLOW. AND
ANOTHER FOOTBALL-SHAPED OBJECT RISING EXTREMELY HIGH AND DISAPPEARING "IN
SECONDS." THE VILLA DO PORTO WEATHER STATION IN THE AZORES SAID A GLOWING
OBJECT DISAPPEARED OVER THE ISLANDS AND THAT ITS ELECTROMEGNETIC
EFFECTS WERE SUCH THAT IT KNOCKED OUT THEIR RADIO TRANSMITTER.
AROUND THE GLOBE ON JULY 15, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS AND
OTHER EXPERTS AT OTTAWA AIRPORT OBSERVERS SAID THEY SPOTTED A FLYING OBJECT
GLINTING IN THE SUN NEAR THE AIRPORT AT CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA. IT
WAS ORIGINALLY SO MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED WHEN AM AR FORCE PLANE
WAS SCRAMBLED TO INVESTIGATE. 
ANOTHER SIGHTING WAS REPORTED LAST NIGHT AT EEYOUTH, MASS. A
RESIDENT SAID HER CHIMNEY CRASHER SAID HER SON, 20, SAID HE
SOUNDED LIKE A FLYING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE."
