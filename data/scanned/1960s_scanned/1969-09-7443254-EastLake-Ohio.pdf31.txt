DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES: SEPTEMBER 15-21, 1969

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the series of daily weather maps published during the period indicated. Surface Weather Map the 500 Millibar Chart, and the 700 and 850 Millibar Charts are included. The surface frontal positions and other surface weather details are shown on the surface weather map. The 500 Millibar Chart shows the contours of the 500-millibar surface. The 700 and 850 Millibar Charts show the contours of the 700 and 850-millibar surfaces.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis based on this data. The analyses show as a mass of arrows where the wind directions and speeds are indicated. The pressure systems are shown as closed lines, and are labeled with the pressure in millibars. The temperature field is shown by lines of constant temperature (isotherms), and the arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 850-millibar level. The stations are identified by their indices, and the temperature, dewpoint, pressure, etc. for each station are given.

The 500 Millibar Chart presents the 500-millibar contour field. The contour lines are labeled in decameters (dam) above sea level. The isotherm field is shown by lines of constant temperature, and the winds are indicated by flags, barbs and pennants on the chart. The 700 and 850 Millibar Charts show similar contour fields for the 700 and 850-millibar surfaces.

The notes on the map tell how to obtain these charts and related weather products. Copies may be obtained through the Environmental Data Service, C3, NOAA, Asheville, N.C. 28801. Only a limited number of copies are available.
