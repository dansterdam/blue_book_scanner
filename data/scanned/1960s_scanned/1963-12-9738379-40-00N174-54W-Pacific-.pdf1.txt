11. COMMENTS: Under observation from rapidly transit across sky. "Objects" appeared to be luminous with blue-green flashes. Reports of this nature indicate the unknown, are interpreted as similar to the "Unidentified Lights" being frequently reported above certain areas. Such visual incidents are interpreted as intensity and frequency indicators of the phenomenon, which are clearly detected on ground radar at the same time, but which are considered to be beyond the capability of any known equipment to identify and track in a definitive manner. Things of this nature occur frequently and do not fall into any known category, despite efforts to associate them with some terrestrial or extra-terrestrial devices whose existence may yet be unverified. It is assumed that they do not represent any known device, aerial or otherwise, and constitute a classification problem of a higher order.
