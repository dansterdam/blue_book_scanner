STATEMENT

On the night of 24 February 1965, Captain Brown and myself took off on a night transition mission from Webb AFB, Big Spring, Texas in a T-33 basic trainer, at 1900 hours. We climbed to 22,500 feet and proceeded to San Angelo, Texas, then turned north to Colorado City, Texas. Our position relative to Webb AFB was approximately 42 NM southeast. At approximately 1920 hours at an altitude of 22,500 feet, traveling at approximately .8 Mach, I sighted a round, white light at the 11 O'clock position at an angle of approximately 10 degrees elevation. The object radiated a white light of high intensity and appeared to be about the size of a dime. It was traveling on an east-to-west course and appeared north of Webb AFB. I called the light to Captain Brown's attention and as we watched it, it blinked on and off approximately 3 times. Each time it blinked off, the light was out for approximately 4 or 5 seconds and at that time no object could be seen in that position. We turned our aircraft and headed toward it accelerating to approximately .95 Mach. The position of the object in relation to us remained constant for 1 or 2 seconds. Then the object accelerated off at a very high rate of speed on a north-westerly direction. It gradually diminished in intensity and was completely out of sight in approximately 3 or 4 seconds. No discernible features could be observed of objects other than the intense white light. Total time of observation from first sighting until it disappeared was approximately 3 minutes.
