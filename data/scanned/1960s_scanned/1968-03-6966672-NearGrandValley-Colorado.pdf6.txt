Transcription of the text in the document:

"Thorne, Rober W. Clarkston, Mich. 
9 Wingate - Patterson, Ct. Forn (Budd?), Colo.
Dear Sir:
I am tremendously excited by your alget-one
observed the night of Aug-16 51-no doubt you 
recall the RFM. near Grand Valley, Colo.
The alget appeared at about 10-30 pm, moving
northeast, seeming to pick up speed, in the direction ship- 
the object went out of sight. Could not confirm
a few seconds cover as the alget began behaving
in a most unusual manner, then disappeared.
There are no lights on this traveling form, but 
the single beam of light from its nose or for part
is enough to do the job. It seems to take on an
eerie, ghostly form under the influence of this
single, solitary beam. This sound could not be
heard and this traveling form moves with
ease and rapidity - the like of which I have
never before witnessed. The sighting is, I 
am sure, of great importance and I would
recommend the subject for further study by
competent scientists."
