There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a document containing a typed transcript of a conversation or interview about a reported UFO sighting.

The text found in the document is as follows:

does it, well, I didn't ask you also, just really how frightened you were. What were you thinking about at the time as it happened? Well, at the time happened, I'll have to say that I was more frightened than I've ever been before in my life. The very strong impression prevailed that I was being observed, if you no what I mean?

That's what I also wanted to ask, as to whether you felt that the thing, so to speak, knew you were there. 

You're dealing here I think, with maybe ESP or spiritualism, but I felt that this was some type of craft, some type of aircraft, that was controlled by some intelligent being. Now, I have no idea whether this was possibly some aircraft that our government was testing or whether it was some foreign government--Russian, Chinese or what not--of whether it was Martian. I have no idea. 

But still you speak in terms of a craft, but the fact remains that all that was visible to you was a light.

Right.

So that this happened many times before. The people say, well, no, all I saw was a light, but I think the light was attachedd to something.

Well, it seemed to be a self-illuminating object, if that makes any sense. It didn't seem to be reflective, and yet it didn't seem to be a light that was coming from way off somewhere else. It seemed to be a very close self-illuminating object. I mean, this was the source of light itself.

Well, now one thing I should ask was the light intensity uniform over the whole thing or did it dim out toward the edges.

It seemed to be# dimmer toward the edges. The edges were, like I said, kind of fuzzy; they were not clearly defined.
