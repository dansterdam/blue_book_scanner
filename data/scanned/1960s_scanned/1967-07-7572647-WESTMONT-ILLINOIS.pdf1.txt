The image does not contain any photograph or visual information. It is a text document that appears to be a Project Blue Book report form. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

1. DATE / TIME GROUP: 25 JULY 1967 / 22604
2. WITNESS: CIVILIAN
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: ONE
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2-3 SECONDS
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: SIGHTING
7. COURSE: NO COURSE
8. PHOTOS: NONE
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NO
10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
COMMENTS: Because of a filling error, investigation of the object photographed was not made until 19-21 July 1967 at which time negatives of the object were submitted and found to be indistinguishable as to its nature. Also, the case will be listed as insufficient data because of lack of physical evidence.
