14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It suddenly disappeared.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud? No. Don't know.

16. Did the object move in front of something or any time, particularly a cloud? No. Don't know.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Completely silent.
b. Color Light green, dull to bright.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or man's length in line with a known object and note how much of the match stick or man is covered by the object. If you had nothing with which to measure this, estimate as closely as possible. About 10 degrees.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and specifically indicate trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
