The image does not contain any photographs. The text appears to be a report from Project Blue Book describing a UFO sighting.

After a while I ran into the house and picked up about a 25 to 30 X power hand telescope and we viewed the object through this.
If the object were to be compared with another object towards the east, the sighting of the object would most likely be compared with a weather balloon under no wind currents and slowly losing height. This could have been a weather balloon because 1 was on a television watching a possible balloon.
When we first saw the object it was at about 15 or 17 degrees in a general northwest direction.
The path of the object seemed strange to me because it would disappear completely for a while as it went behind some power wires and buildings and then we would see it again in a slightly different position. But there was one strange thing. The white light kept getting brighter and dimmer as if some mechanism was controlling it.
There was only one object I could see during the entire sighting.
At the time of the sighting, two other people were with me. They both saw the object and we all agree that what we saw was extraordinary. I have read dozens of LIFO sightings. I have talked to people that have seen UFUs but the conclusion was that this was fairly strange. If anyone would care to study this, mentally, on aerial phenomena, I still don't know what it was. Whatever it was, it puzzled me as a man. One was my brother and the other I don't know. My impression is that they think that others might be interested in this report. I might add that this report is made from notes I took at the time of the sighting. I have something describing this and it is as follows:
