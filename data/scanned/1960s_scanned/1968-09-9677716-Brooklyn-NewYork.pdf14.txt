The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass rose with directional labels. The second sketch depicts a person standing in a landscape, with two circular inset images showing different perspectives of the landscape.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A RING FROM THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO REPRESENT THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON WAS ERRATIC, CURVILINEAR, OR RECTILINEAR. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS SECTION.
