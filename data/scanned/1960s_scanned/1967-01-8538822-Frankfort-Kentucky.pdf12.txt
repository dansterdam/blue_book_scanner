Gentlemen:

On the evening of January 13, 1967, I telephoned your office regarding several strange-looking objects on three occasions viewed from my home (January 13, 14, and 15), near the Kentucky Utilities Power Plant, located between Lawrenceburg and Frankfort.

Because of my curiosity about the objects' proximity to the power plant, I have since tried to determine more of their characteristics, and discovered that the object I saw hovering was located exactly one-tenth of a mile from the power plant, as calculated from the distance I was located at that point.

You will notice in the closing I am enclosing (from the January 26, 1967, letter) that objects similar to the ones I witnessed were reported on the same evening in the same general area.

Several other reports, similar to the one I am enclosing, have come to my attention, and some of those reports indicate the same type of object I watched near the power plant.

The similarity of all of these accounts is striking. I think, and I felt that your strange report is worthy of additional investigation. Perhaps it will be of some help in the study being made concerning UFOs.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
