UFO Mystery
Under Study
By Major Hector Quintanilla of the United States Air Force
The last few months have brought to light several sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which the Air Force expects to know shortly. Major Hector Quintanilla of the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base said the Air Force is investigating several sightings.
The major said one of the two major documents (which he is studying) is a case where the report states that the pilot (space craft's occupant) has been sent to the Psych Evaluation Division. This is the first time such a thing has happened, according to any known written language. 
The Air Force scientist said during January and February of 1965, several sightings were reported in the state of Florida and some were investigated by the Air Force. He said many of the sightings, however, appear to have not been caused by any known objects in the earth's atmosphere. Other times they may have been atmospheric disturbances. 
Such was the case in 1952 when sightings in western Ohio were sighted for several weeks and soon identified as a "decaying satellite." The Florida sightings enter a different category. The Florida unit, a Wellman Air Force Base, was investigating a sighting on March 1, 1965, near Brooksville, Florida. (Continued on Page Six)
