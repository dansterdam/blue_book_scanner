1. forwarded a film strip to the U.S. Air Force which showed a UFO on several frames.

2. The film is showing a routine silhouette of a statue in the city side park in Champaign, Illinois. The filming took place at 20552 on 7 June 1960.

3. The film was analyzed by ATIC and the following concluded:
a. The object on the film is a genuine photographic image.
b. The object was a light source of considerable intensity, due to its being entirely visible within sight degrees of the sun.
c. The object was traveling at a very high velocity as evidenced by the fact that it moved through the camera's field of view in 1/4 second.
d. Image motion during exposure precludes any analysis of object configuration; however, its extremely high velocity and brilliance indicates that the object was probably a meteor or the "fireball" class.

4. No request has not given any publicity to this sighting, but it did request notification of the result of the Air Force analysis.
