The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report describing an observation of some sort of unidentified flying object.

AND OBJECT CARE OF THE SORT OF CHASE. I THEN TOLD MY SISTER TO GO IN AND GET HER CAMERA WHICH IS A HAWKEYE BY KODAK.

WE HAD A STAR LIGHT SET UP AND MY BROTHER TURNED IT ON AND I TOOK THREE PICTURES. THE PICTURES FAILED TO COME OUT BECAUSE OF POOR LIGHTING. BY THIS TIME THE KIDS FROM ACROSS THE STREET CAME OVER AND SAW THE OBJECT. I WON'T MENTION ANY NAMES THOUGH. MY FATHER WAS OUT SHOPPING AND MY MOTHER WAS IN A WHEEL CHAIR WITH MS. SO THEY COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING. THE OBJECT MOST HAVE BEEN GOING VERY VERY SLOW, NEVER VERY VERY FAST, WHICH IS SLOW FOR AN AIRPLANE, AND IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A HELICOPTER BECAUSE OF NO SOUND. THE THING WAS AT ABOUT 7:20 PM. I AM ENCLOSING 2 NEGATIVES FROM THE I TOOK. THE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPED THEM ONLY COULD GET NEGATIVES BUT NOT PICTURES. IF YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH THE AREA NEGATIVES PLEASE LET ME KNOW ON THE NEXT PAGE I WILL REVIEW EVENTS.
