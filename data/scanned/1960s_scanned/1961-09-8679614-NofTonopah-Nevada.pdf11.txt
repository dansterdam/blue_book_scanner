September 20, 1963

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your letter of August 12, 1963, to the Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has been forwarded to this Headquarters for reply.

Your report of September 29, 1961, was evaluated and placed on file. The initial object, sighted north of Tonopah, Nevada, was evaluated as the planet Venus in this position. The initial report indicated the object's hovering and maneuverability, however, the final conclusion considered the duration and maneuverability as normal for the planet Venus. Consequently, the second object is carried as unidentified.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
