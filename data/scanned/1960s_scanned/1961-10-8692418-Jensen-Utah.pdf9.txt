AFFIDAVIT-STATEINTERVIEW
I, John Jensen, hereby state the following:
On October 8, 1961, at approximately 9:15 P.M., I observed a bright, round, hovering object in the sky near my home in Jensen, Utah. The object appeared to be approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter and was hovering at an estimated altitude of 300 to 400 feet.
The object was silent and had no visible means of propulsion. It hovered in the sky for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view. I reported this sighting to the local authorities and also to the United States Air Force as part of Project Blue Book.
Signed,
John Jensen
