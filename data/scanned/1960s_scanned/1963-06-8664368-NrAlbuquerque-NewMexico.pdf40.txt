The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The document contains a table with information about the sighting of a celestial object, likely a planet, which was observed around the time of sunset. The table provides details about the sighting, including the time, elevation, and azimuth of the object as it moved across the sky.
