There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document with a questionnaire or form that has been filled out. The text in the image states:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: - Day - Month - Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The respondent has provided a handwritten response to question 35, which appears to be a narrative explanation of their UFO sighting, but the text is not legible enough for me to transcribe accurately.
