REPORT NO.: ASRCP 62-4
SAMPLE NO. : 6771
MANUFACTURER: UNKNOWN
SUBMITTED BY: ASYM
Capt. Gearhart
I. PURPOSE: To determine the composition of the sample submitted for analysis and its origin if possible.
II. FACTUAL DATA:
1. The sample submitted for analysis was a designed Materials Physics laboratory specimen.
2. Microscopic examination showed the presence of finely divided metal-like particles.
3. Analysis of different portions of the sample by emission spectrographic methods showed the presence of the following elements:
a. Aluminum
b. Magnesium, calcium, silicon
c. Traces of manganese, lead, copper, and titanium.
4. Analysis by X-ray methods indicated the presence of alpha-alumina. This material has a bayerite-crystalline structure.
5. Analysis of mass spectrometric data using a double lens Mattauch-Herzog mass spectrometer showed that the metal-like particles were analytic by mass spectrometric methods, showed that the organic material was composed of polysaccharides.
