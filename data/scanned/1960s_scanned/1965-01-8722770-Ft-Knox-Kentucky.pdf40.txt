"Mystery Light
Seen After TV
Stops Working

At approximately 7:30 PM on the evening of January 7, 1965, the undersigned was watching TV in his home in Manchester, NH. The TV suddenly went off, and remained off for approximately 10-15 minutes.

Shortly after the TV went off, a bright light appeared in the room, about 4-5 feet from the TV set. The light was approximately 4 inches in diameter, and appeared to be spherical in shape. It hovered about 3 feet off the floor, and remained stationary for about 2 minutes.

The light then began to move slowly toward the wall, and as it approached the wall, it gradually dimmed, finally disappearing completely. The light seemed to have some depth to it, and gave off a faint glow, but did not illuminate the room.

The witness was alone in the room at the time, and was the only one to observe the light. He is certain that the light was not caused by any known source, and was not a reflection or an hallucination. He also noted that the light had no visible means of support, and seemed to float in mid-air.

This incident, which lasted a total of about 5 minutes, is considered to be of great interest, and may be related to similar reports of "mystery lights" observed in connection with electrical disturbances."
