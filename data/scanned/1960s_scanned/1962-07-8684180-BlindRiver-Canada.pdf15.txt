The image does not contain any photographs. Instead, it contains two sketches.

The first sketch shows a curved line with an "X" on it, and instructions to imagine that an object was sighted above the horizon (skyline) and to indicate how high the object was above the horizon.

The second sketch shows a larger view with two additional drawings. One drawing depicts a person standing on a road with buildings in the background. The other drawing shows a silhouette of a person standing on a road with a mountainous landscape in the background.

Transcribing the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
