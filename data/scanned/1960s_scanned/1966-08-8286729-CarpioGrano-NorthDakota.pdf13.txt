A29 Holiday, the strike team leader, was also interviewed by the undersigned at M-4 during hours of darkness. He provided the following information:

A few days after the incident, A29 Turner approached the wife they had with them (hereafter referred to as the "object") and said the object had been tracked at various times up to 100 degrees on the compass. Upon arrival at the site, A29 Turner pointed out an unusually bright object on the ground to approximately 70 degrees which was very high. After examining the object for some time, they turned back to the "white light". He observed that the "white light" was approximately 100 degrees which was very close to the first object he had pointed out. The object he had pointed out to them could not be found again.

During the interview, the striking force leader (A29 Holiday) was also interviewed at M-4. He kept his attention on a white object at approximately 100 degrees which was very close to the first object A29 Turner had pointed out. The object also disappeared at various times for approximately 30 seconds at a time.

A29 Holiday had been on leave since 12 December 1966 and was not available for questioning.

A Attachment #2 is a transcript of the sequence of events recorded in the log book at south base (radar base). Attachment #3 represents a radar track obtained at Minot AFB. As a result of the further stated that the "object" was on his radar scope continuously from the time he picked it up until it was lost by intermittent BUIC I Central Control approximately 1800 hours, approximately 15 mins after the visual sighting on the ground. Sgt Semcho stated that the object disappeared, or was lost by radar, but they could not regain contact. The object did not alter its course except during the period when the fighter was in the area. The object did not alter its course when the interceptor plus fighter was in the area. The object did not alter its course when a second F-4 Phantom II fighter from the 5th Tactical Fighter Squadron, who piloted the intercept plane, was advised that he flew intermittently out of sight for a blood 30,000 ft, 30,000 ft, and back again. His plane's radar equipment and infrared detection equipment recorded no contact. It was not necessary for you to write Col Duncan C. Myers, Director of Operations, Grand Forks Air Defense Sector, detailing the information. The undersigned was unable to secure this particular sequence of events.

If you asked several questions about the credibility of radar to detect an object at 95 miles. It will be necessary to limit the information provided on this area because the exact capabilities of the Air
