The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typewritten text describing a series of UFO sightings in the Fort Pierce, Florida area.

The text is as follows:

The following is an example of UFO sightings involving multiple witnesses that was received from the Command at the Air Force Base at Fort Pierce, Florida. In the many observers, including airline and military personnel, observed an object of unusual size, shape, and color during the period the Air Force UFO investigators were on the scene. The object, which was initially a round, brilliant-white light, slowly changed colors and size during the sighting, sometimes changing colors rapidly. When the object went into clear air turbulence, it was observed to shed a small, brilliant-white light. At one point, the object was observed to split into four parts, continuing in the same general direction, before reuniting again. The object was observed for a possible explanation, it noticed that large and small fires occurred in the immediate area at about the same time, which suggest the possibility of some unusual atmospheric disturbance. It was noted, however, that this was the only indication that the object may have been related to the fires and that there was no absolute proof to tie the two together. In the opinion of the Air Force investigators, the object sightings were of sufficient significance to warrant continued investigation, and the case was coded by the Air Force as an "Unresolved" incident.
