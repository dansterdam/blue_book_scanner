There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing text.

Text from the document:

He said that he grabbed up the pictures and ran up there like a - I was so scared that I was yelling like something was after me. He said that though these white lights to come out of something, I grabbed the pictures and when we got back down here, it was gone. It started dropping down, he said, and when it got to about 20 feet from the ground, it started calling - it started rising in the air. It started picking up.

Had it moved quite a distance between the two pictures you took? 
No, sir. It looked to be further away.

A little further away. Did you want to take more pictures or were you afraid to get any closer picture all of a sudden?
I was so scared that I guess two pictures was all I could take. I was so scared and dressed up it as I could describe how scared I was.

Why, were you scared?
Well, there it was hovering out there. I read Science fiction, and all stories of these weird actions, you know. There it is, out there in the field. - And I am all alone, and I was so scared, you know.

You are a member of a little club of your friends, a flying saucer club.
And how many people are there in your club? 
Four.

Four members. And you discuss this sort of thing quite a bit, I see.
Yes, sir.

Was this boy that came down with you a member of this flying saucer club?
No, I had never seen anything like that before, no flying saucer, I had up and watched the members. But he hasn't seen a flying saucer, either.
