IT WAS ABOUT 9:45 PM ON A CLEAR NIGHT. I WAS SITTING OUTSIDE LOOKING UP AT THE CLEAR NIGHT SKY WHEN I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT, MUCH BRIGHTER THAN A STAR, MOVING SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY FROM WEST TO EAST. IT WAS TRAVELING AT A STEADY RATE AND MADE NO SOUND. IT DID NOT BLINK OR CHANGE INTENSITY. I WATCHED IT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHAT IT WAS, BUT IT DID NOT SEEM LIKE ANY AIRCRAFT I'VE EVER SEEN.
