First Night Color Shot 
Of Flying Saucer Bared

On August 3, 1945, Alan Smith, 19, of Edgewood a suburb of
San Antonio, Texas, claims he saw a mysterious light in the
darkened sky and clicked the shutter of his camera.
The negative he recovered show, in color, what he claims to be
the first night color shot of a flying saucer.
Smith was one of a group of unidentified persons who reportedly
saw the object on that date. The Air Force has not commented on
this case.
The Air Force on August 1 and this flight were pressed, did not
believe it to be the first night color photograph of flying
saucers previously recorded, since it has been determined from
the one-in-a-million possibility of the incident being real.
The negative shows a yellowish, blue, and white disk-shaped
object with a dark area in the middle, believed to be the
turbine engine. From the object are three tiny lights in a
triangular formation, which are believed to be the multi-
colored running lights system. They could have been lighting
system for landing or takeoff purposes, it is believed.
The same type of phenomenon was reported to have been
sighted in Tulsa, Oklahoma, December and other places in the
southwest, and similar craft were explained away by the Air
Force as being aircraft or weather balloons.
