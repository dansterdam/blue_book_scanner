Dear Mrs Hunt,

This is in response to your letter of 17 May 1965 concerning the reported observation of a serial object. The information with certain details concerning the time, location, and appearance of the object, as contained in your letter, has been recorded in our files.

It is a policy of this office to advise the public that we do not identify or confirm the existence of any particular aerial object. This is due to the limited data available on any single case, and the inability to determine conclusively the nature of the object observed.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

JOHN H. SPAULDING 
Chief, Community Relations Division
