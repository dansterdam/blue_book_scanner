Dear Sir:

I am writing this letter regarding our earlier letter of December 16 concerning the sighting of a circular unidentified flying object which is entering the earth's atmosphere at a high rate of speed, and which is considered to be a closer distance for this time of the year.

Although we do not presently endorse books pertaining to the subject of unidentified flying objects, you may wish to read two books on this subject which are generally considered a reliable source of information. These books are "Flying Saucers and the Straight-Line Mystery" by Coral E. Lorenzen, and "Anatomy of a Phenomenon" by Jacques Vallee.

Thank you for your letter.

Sincerely,

D. T. NELSON, JR.
