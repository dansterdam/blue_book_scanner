The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions for a person to sketch the motion of an object or objects. The diagram includes a compass rose and instructions to indicate the height of the object above the horizon, the direction it was moving, and how it changed direction over time.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place on "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were strung, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
