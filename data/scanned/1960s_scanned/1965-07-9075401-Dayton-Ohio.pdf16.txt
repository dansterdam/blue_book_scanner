The Portuguese UAOs

Shortly after 4:30 a.m. on the 19th of July, 1963, Mr. and Mrs. Manuel Fernandez of Moita, near Lisbon, Portugal, were awakened by a loud noise outside. They went outdoors well with buckets to get water. She took a quick look at the sky and saw an object coming out of the northwest, which she described as strange-looking. According to the interviews, Mrs. F. admitted she was startled at first, thinking it was a strange airplane, with which she was familiar.

The object, which looked like a "cardinal's hat", had a round "brim" and a rounded top. It stopped over the woods near their home and Mrs. Fernandez dropped her buckets and ran to get her husband. During a later interview, Mr. F. said his wife was so excited she had difficulty understanding what he told him, and at first thought she had seen a cardinal's hat in the courtyard. When he looked, he saw the thing about a quarter of a mile away from the house. He said the object had a dark, round brim and a brilliant, orange-colored round top, which looked as if the light was coming from the inside. "At one point on the brim, exactly on the side closer to the airport, there was a strong white light", Mr. Fernandez reported. Although it stayed just above the trees, the object leaned.
