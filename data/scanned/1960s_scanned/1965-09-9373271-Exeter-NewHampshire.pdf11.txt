CLOSE SIGHTING BY POLICE AND OTHERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE: Among the inexplicable sightings is this one in New Hampshire. It reportedly occurred on the 3rd of September 1965. The incident is described by a man named Norman Muscarello. He stated that he had hitchhiked home from his job and while walking along a busy highway, he said the desk officer told him that a huge, glowing object with flashing lights was hovering over a field. He immediately went to the spot and saw the object, which he described as oval-shaped and quite different from any aircraft he had ever seen. The object was about 40-50 feet in diameter and about 40 feet off the ground. It was hovering and flashing intermittently. Two other policemen and several civilians also observed the object. The object suddenly vanished as quickly as it had appeared. The tremendous commotion and kicking at the police station were unprecedented.
