Transcription of the text in the document:

UNTYPED

As per phone conversation with Mr. Hynek, the enclosed report is forwarded for your information and handling. Apparently, it describes an unusual aerial object observed near Gainsville, Florida, during the period November 7, 1969.

The report appears to be complete and, except for the apparently handwritten notation "UNTYPED" at the top of the page, contains no other handwritten material. The description of the observed object indicates that it was of an unusual nature and apparently gave the observers some concern. However, no conclusions are drawn or recommendations made.
