The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads:

"THE REPORTED TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS OBSERVED FAST OF KALAMAZOO AT 12:40 HO FURTHER DATA WERE REPORTED. SIGHTING WEST VICINITY OF BATTLE CREEK BETWEEN 13:37 AND 12:42. MOST REPORTS DESCRIBED A BRILLIANT, SHINY OBJECT, FLOATING TOWARD THE EAST-NORTHEAST OF BATTLE CREEK. SEVERAL REPORTS ALSO DESCRIBED A FAN-SHAPE "TRAIL" APPARENTLY TRAILING FROM THE OBJECT. "TRAIL" APPEARED TO OSCILLATE IN FLIGHT. NO FURTHER DATA. LAST REPORTED SIGHTINGS MANY IN NUMBER OCCURRED VICINITY OF DETROIT AND SELFRIDGE AFB APPROXIMATELY 15:02 TO 15:22. OBJECT APPEARED TO RESEMBLE BALLOON OR SOMETHING FOLLOWING COURSE NOT FURTHER DESCRIBED. NO UFO HAS BEEN TRACKED BY DETROIT AIR DEFENSE SECTOR FACILITIES DURING STATED TIME PERIODS. A GENERAL TEMPERATURE INVERSION CONDITION COVERED THE SECTOR AREA DURING THE MORNINGS. KIND PATTERNS WERE SUCH THAT A BALLOON LAUNCHED IN AREA TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST OF DETROIT SECTOR WOULD TRANSIT THE SECTOR."
