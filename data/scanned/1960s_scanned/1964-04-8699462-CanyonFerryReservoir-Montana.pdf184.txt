More marks on the ground

The following account is taken from the Helena Gazette for May 1, 1964. The sheriff's office said today it is investigating marks left on the ground by what was described as an unidentified flying object. Reports indicate the area east of Canyon Ferry Lake near Montana river was sighted - the spot on the night of April 29, along the shoreline of Canyon Ferry Lake. They found four holes about 13 feet apart, six to eight inches deep and eight to 10 inches across. The holes were small, like direct fuel according to one reporter. A circular spot was entered into the top of the undisturbed grass, the spot appearing to be about six feet in diameter from the sheriff's report.
"I was looking at the glow in my bedroom window," she said. She said she and her brother, home alone, sighted it about 10:30 p.m.
The holes were discovered about 125 feet from the rear of the Davis home and about the same distance from the lake shore.
The reports of the scorched area indicate a saucer-shaped object with marks in the ground, according to local police. A Socorro incident is reported fully elsewhere in this issue. (Credit to Mr. Ronald W.J. Anslee)
