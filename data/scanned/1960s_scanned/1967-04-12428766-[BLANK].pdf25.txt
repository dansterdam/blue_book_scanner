I AM SURE THAT MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE AIR FORCE CONTRACT SIGNED LAST YEAR WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO. THIS CONTRACT, VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $300,000, IS BETWEEN THE AIR FORCE OFFICE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND THE UNIVERSITY. 

IT CALLS FOR AN 18-MONTH STUDY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF DR. EDWARD U. CONDON, FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS AND NOW A PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO.

I WANT TO MAKE ONE POINT VERY CLEAR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT. THE ONLY INVOLVEMENT OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK WITH THE COLORADO CONTRACT IS TO PROVIDE THEM DUPLICATES OF ALL CURRENT UFO REPORTS AND SUCH MATERIAL FROM OUR FILES AS THEY MAY ASK FOR. AS A MATTER OF INTEREST, TO DATE I HAVE SUPPLIED THEM WITH AT LEAST 400 CASE HISTORIES.

DR. CONDON IS CONDUCTING A TOTALLY INDEPENDENT STUDY.

IN CONCLUSION I WANT TO READ TWO PARAGRAPHS FROM THE CURRENT PROJECT BLUE BOOK REPORT:

"TO DATE, THE FIRM CONCLUSIONS OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK ARE: (1) NO UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTED, INVESTIGATED, AND EVALUATED BY THE AIR FORCE HAS EVER GIVEN ANY INDICATION OF THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY;"
