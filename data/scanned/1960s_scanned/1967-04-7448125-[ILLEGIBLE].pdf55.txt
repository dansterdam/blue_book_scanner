35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

All I can say is that the object I seen was moving with out making any sound, moving at a very high rate of speed. It seemed to me to be very close and about the size of a basket ball. I'm quite sure that I saw an unidentified flying object and this was not the first time I had seen them but this is the closest and clearest view I have ever had. I don't know whether it was an experimental type of aircraft or what it was but I do know that it was not an ordinary aircraft that I am used to seeing.
