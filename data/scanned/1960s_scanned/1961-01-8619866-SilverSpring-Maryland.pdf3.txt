Complaint received at approx 9:45 PM on 25 February 1961. Witness - Raeburn Winfield Schmidt, 1313 Barrington Drive, Silver Spring, Maryland. 
The light was stationary at first - about 10 seconds - then it moved slightly for a few seconds - then it went up very rapidly to a great height and disappeared.
It was a very brilliant white light, approximately 4 inches in diameter and 8-9 feet above the ground. The light appeared to be round and slightly larger than a baseball. There was no sound associated with the light.
After moving up rapidly, the light simply disappeared and was not seen again.
The duration of the sighting was approximately 30-40 seconds.

1. The object was a reddish-orange light - a vehicle with a headlight.
2. The object was a high-flying jet or aircraft - not unusual.
3. The object was an unidentified aerial phenomenon - not explained.
4. The object was a reflected light - not explained.
