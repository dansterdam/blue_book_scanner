"To the above report, Director, C.I.A.

1. Regarding the home construction work mentioned in paragraph 1; this matter was brought to my attention by an official of your office during a conversation with me in 1956. The individual expressed an interest in the matter.

2. Do the photos mentioned indicate any evidence of construction for a possible underground installation or any indication of underground construction?

3. I do not have any kind of evidence to indicate that there has been any extensive underground construction in the area mentioned.

11. Brig. Gen. Douglas mentioned this case to me and classified it C.I.A.

12. As the former major who made the report, I am requesting information on any progress or conclusions on the evaluation of this case.

13. I do want to make only this point: I felt the matter was worth reporting because of the observations made. These do not appear to be the normal run of case in my experience.

15. May I ask if there has been any further interest and follow up on this case by your office, or was it dropped?

16. The matter came to my attention in an unusual way, and I felt it deserved an official report and evaluation from your office."
