As the reporting agent, I received a call at about 8:50 p.m. telling me to look outside because there was some type of unidentified flying object in the sky. I went outside with the caller and observed the object. It was well defined and appeared to be about 25 degrees above the horizon to the southwest.
The object was observed for about 15 minutes. It was hovering and maintaining a constant heading. There were six similar lights about 11 degrees above the area. The main object appeared to be about 40 feet in diameter and was emitting a steady blue-white light. It seemed to have a bright corona around it. The object was observed to suddenly start moving to the southwest and continued out of sight. As the object moved, it gave the appearance as the first two. At about 20 degrees above the horizon, it stopped and hovered for about two minutes, then started moving again, this time to the northwest and was observed for about four minutes, then disappeared into the night sky.
