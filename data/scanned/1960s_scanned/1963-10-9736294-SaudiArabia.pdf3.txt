he was a little startled when at first saw the
object, but soon settled
down and watched it closely. The object
seemed to be a very bright light, almost white in color, and was
rocking or oscillating from side to side as it moved. It was
traveling at a high rate of speed, and was estimated to be
traveling at an altitude of about 15,000 to 20,000 feet. During the
time the object was in sight, it did not change its course or speed.
After about 12 minutes, the object faded from sight, seemingly
going out of sight in the distance. There was no sound associated
with the object. The witness stated that the object was definitely
not an aircraft, and that he is familiar with all types of aircraft
in this area.
