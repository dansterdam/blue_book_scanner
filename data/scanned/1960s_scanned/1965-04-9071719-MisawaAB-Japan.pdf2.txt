6. Misawa RAPCON officers could discern no special pattern in the unidentified targets. They were not always on the Misawa runway (or possibly toward the NW as indicated in the details). The targets did not converge in any identifiable manner.
From the general description, the tracks are what might be expected from normal aircraft operations (i.e. approaching, landing, etc.) No positive identification was made of the type of equipment at Misawa. However, investigation to date has not disclosed any information which might clearly indicate the identity or nature of the targets.
6. (C) In addition to the incidents on 10, 11, and 12 April described above, the same type of targets were observed on 14 April. The targets were seen on eight occasions on that date; they were erratic and irregular rather than in any consistent pattern, and in one instance, two were present.
7. (U) Any additional data which might clearly indicate the identity or nature of the targets will be forwarded if it becomes available.
