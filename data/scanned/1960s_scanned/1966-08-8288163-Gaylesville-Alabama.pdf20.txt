The image contains a detailed diagram illustrating a three-dimensional figure and its movement. The diagram appears to be part of a document related to a UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) report from Project Blue Book.

Text extracted from the document:

If one now considers the view with respect to their position on the three dimensional figure, the three dimensional figure could possibly look as shown below.

Center 1/2 hr: Moving up and down normal to plane formed by these lights.

This is what I believe we saw, on a three-dimensional basis. Now, what was it?
