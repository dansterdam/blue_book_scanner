TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Det Daley reported the UFO by telephone to the Hollywood Air Route Traffic Control Center of the Federal Aviation Agency. Sighted on 1/12/62 at 1945 hours near Altadena, California, at approximately 15 hours after initial notification to FAA.

Deputy John R. Hogan explained that the Sheriff's Building in Altadena had a search light on the roof constantly turned toward the north, which rises abruptly to about 2,000 feet.

Los Angeles International and Santa Monica Airports were contacted for any information regarding weather balloons released between 1930 and 1945 hours, but none were reported.

The weather office at Santa Monica Airport released a weather balloon at 0945 hours, while a San Diego Airport weather balloon was released at 0945 hours.

From all the information gathered, it would be most likely to assume that the UFO was very possibly a weather balloon. The fact that the object was white, bright in appearance, and the slim shape of it would indicate that it could have been a weather balloon released from Santa Monica Airport. In addition, the weather balloon released from Santa Monica Airport was reported as being visible for at least 15 minutes.

Santa Monica Airport is located 5 miles in a direct line SW of the Altadena location from the alleged sighting. The object sighted was very slight and variable, it is entirely possible that the object sighted was this weather balloon, which was blown inland by the prevailing westerly winds. The fact that the balloon required 45 minutes to reach Altadena makes this entirely possible.

The observers stated that at first the object seemed to move rather slowly. Then as it came overhead, its speed increased very rapidly.
