Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output of the text in the document:

25 minute conference called with them, IFOUSO (no) and NICAP headquarters, Washignton, D.C. They had some radio and telephone communication in and and took a 25 minute interview for some newspaper. I was up at 2:00 and received a call indicating that they were reporters and interviewing me. At 7:30 in the evening Radio and TV station KYI had a senior officer. NICAPLS wanted a complete rundown by telephone. We sighted many airplanes but no UFOs. Many of the calls we received reported captures of UFOs. Some we could definitely identify as airplanes. Over 2,000 persons were there. That was the largest group we have had this year, it was over 5,000 persons. The 6:30 home by 11:15 we did have two four inch telescopes. The reports we received are not complete. The recovered fragments were received Sunday night from a boy who had received some toy from Texas. A 1970 red and white Ford rammed a 1970 car, The boy who was driving the other car, we could not determine what he found. We have been unable to locate the boy. There is nothing in the story but that I am sending them. We have a lab in Oklahoma City working on it now. The results of the documents are radioactive and highly reactive. (As you can tell) They are only evidence that they are there, send you what the lab hear says. Working on two good leads. If they are there, these may prove your interest.
