Text from the document:

THE OBJECT WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE, SILVER IN COLOR AND REFLECTED THE SUNLIGHT. IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER THE GROUND. AT INTERVALS IT WOULD DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR, INDICATING EITHER A PULSING OR BLINKING EFFECT.
WHEN IT FIRST CAME INTO VIEW IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 1 1/2 MILES AWAY AND SEEMED TO BE HOVERING ABOUT 150-200 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT MOVED IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS.
AFTER ABOUT A MINUTE IT REAPPEARED FURTHER EAST AND AGAIN DISAPPEARED. THIS CYCLE OF APPEARING, DISAPPEARING AND REAPPEARING WAS OBSERVED FOR ABOUT 2-3 MINUTES.
THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY THREE PERSONS, ONE OF WHOM WAS A POLICE OFFICER. WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE CLEAR AND VISIBILITY WAS EXCELLENT. NO SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE OBJECT.
