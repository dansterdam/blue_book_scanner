SUBJECT:   UFO Report (Major Colman)
CH 65 01

1. Forwarding the attached copy of a letter from Lt Col __________ regarding the first object viewed by the witness was probably due to an abnormal refraction phenomena.
2. The second object viewed by the same witness on the same night is considered physically real and unexplained. This object produced an unusual light beam and was the brighter of the two.
3. The final experience has been reported to FTD on a previous occasion. To date no firm conclusion as to the nature of this phenomenon is warranted. It is suggested to be further investigated.
