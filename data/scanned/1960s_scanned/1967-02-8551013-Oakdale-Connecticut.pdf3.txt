Dear Sir:

I have been aware for a period of three months or more of what I believe to be an unusual light in the sky at 6300 o'clock. I saw it again last night.

It's usual pattern was as it became first it went up, then it seemed to blend with the sky, and it was as far up as it seemed to be blending with the sky.

One night I wanted to see where and what direction it took, if I could see where and what direction it took, and I watched every night but could not see where and what direction it took.

Thursday at February 22nd at 5:00 p.m. I looked out the window and I went into the same place I had been before. I went back to the window, I left it on and went on the other side looking, and I could see it. It started moving, and it seemed to move slowly at first and then it went faster, and then it went slower, and then it would go faster again. It frightened me. I watched it every night after this and it seemed to do the same thing.

On the 12th of February at 5:00 a.m. I again saw this same light, and this time it seemed to go up a tiny bit and straight even with the blending of the sky.

Thursday evening February 16th at 6:45 Little I was sitting glued to the window and watched it again. It seemed to move a little faster than the other times I had watched it, and then it would seem to move a little slower.
