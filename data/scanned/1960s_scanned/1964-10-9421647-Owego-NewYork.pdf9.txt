The image provided does not contain any photographs, only a sketch with a compass rose and instructions for the viewer. The text output from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object appeared to be above the horizon (daytime) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction from which the object first appeared. Place a "B" on the compass to show the direction in which the object was last seen.
90°
75°
60°
45°
30°
15°

28. Draw a picture of the path that will show the motion of the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
B------to----East--------running North
29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
