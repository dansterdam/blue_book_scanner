"Montevideo, Minnesota
November 23, 1962

Director of Intelligence
Headquarters, U.S.A.F. 
Washington 25, D.C.

Gentlemen:

On November 20, at 12:50 A.M., 2 semi-circular objects were passing over my building at a very high rate of speed and so low they seemed to graze the tops of the trees. The light was very bright and so thought it would crash into the house. It was no sound of any kind. 
It gave off a white light and it was brighter than a full moon on a clear night.

I have seen weather balloons, satellites and other objects, but this object was traveling in a westerly direction.
