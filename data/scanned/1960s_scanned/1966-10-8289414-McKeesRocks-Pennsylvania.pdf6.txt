There is no photograph present in this image. The document appears to be handwritten text that reads as follows:

When the object appeared it maneuvered very fast, it left contrails. Some hazy about 6 to 2 miles in diameter. There seemed to be about 6 to 10 lights on the craft and they were too bright to be visible with the naked eye, they seemed to be flashing in a counterclockwise manner. The formation can best be described as a spinning top or similar to the motion of a French top.
