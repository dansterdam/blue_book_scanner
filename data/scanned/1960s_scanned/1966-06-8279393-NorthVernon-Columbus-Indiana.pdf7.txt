The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document containing a detailed description of a UFO sighting. 

We drove on, and suddenly, coming towards us at tremendous speed, was one more combat-type object, the lights of which was being observed. It was a very low altitude, and it stayed there, while we drove by, and looked up at it. It was indeed like this: white-bright lights, and stayed there for what seemed to us like about a couple of minutes.

Completely around it, it just stayed there - "parked", or "maneuvered". For the object, as we could look back, and see it. All these craft moved effortlessly, and there was no sound. At first, it was silent. And I've never seen a "jet stop on a dime", so to speak, as these craft were so quick, and so close to us, and so brilliantly lighted.

I don't know why, but instinctively, I felt slightly afraid, if these were the most beautiful things I've ever seen. As soon as we arrived home, I made notes of everything I could think of. I told all my friends, and the doctor, who would listen. Nobody would believe me. They said I should never talk about it, or no one would believe me.

If I am no better than they are - but following are some bits and pieces that may be put together. Anytime they come, and at least have a landing, please contact me and let me know, as I would love to talk to, possibly these same people. I don't know, but I am very curious to learn more about them.

Very truly yours,
