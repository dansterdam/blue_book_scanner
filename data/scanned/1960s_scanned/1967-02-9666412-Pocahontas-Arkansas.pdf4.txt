PG 3 OF 3
R 38-8168, CALL SIGN GAUZY 25, PILOTED BY CAPT DONALD K. NIMS,
FR58138, 387TH BOMB SQUADRON, WAS OVER THE WALNUT RIDGE VOR AT
26562Z FEB 67, ARRIVING FROM THE SOUTHWEST. THE WALNUT RIDGE
PAGE 3 REPT8P2009. UNCLASS
VOR IS APPROXIMATELY 15 NM SOUTH OF POCAHONTAS, ARKANSAS. PARA 14K
(KILO) CHIEF, INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, 97TH BOMBARDMENT WING, BLYTHEVILLE, ARKANSAS. ALTHOUGH A SATELLITE SCHEDULE IS NOT AVAILABLE,
THE MOST LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR THIS SIGHTING IS THAT THE OBSERVER
SAW A SATELLITE. OBSERVER IMPLACATED A FAMILIARITY WITH JET AIRCRAFT
TRAFFIC IN THE AREA AND GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN AIRCRAFT AND OTHER OBJECTS. OBSERVER ACKNOWLEDGED
INABILITY TO ESTIMATE ALTITUDES OF JET AIRCRAFT BUT DESCRIBED THE
OBJECT AS BEING "UP WHEN THE JETS FLY," PERHAPS 20,000 FEET.** THIS
SIGHTING IS SIMILAR TO OTHERS OCCURRING IN THIS AREA ON "CLEAR AND
COLD" NIGHTS WHEREIN THE OBJECT WAS BELIEVED TO BE A SATELLITE. THE
FACT THAT THE OBJECT WAS IN VIEW FOR ONLY ONE MINUTE TENDS TO
PRECLUDE IT AS BEING THE CAUSE OF THE SIGHTING. PARA TWL
(LUNA) NONE.
