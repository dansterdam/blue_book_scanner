New Comet Promises Big Show

Astronomers are predicting that the new comet which has been discovered will put on a spectacular show after it passes closest to the sun later this month. 

Designated comet Ikeya-Seki, it will reach its perihelion, or closest point to the sun, on October 21. The comet's tail, which is already visible in the western sky after sunset, is expected to become brilliant and very long.

Dr. Fred L. Whipple, director of the Harvard College Observatory, says the new comet may well become the brightest seen in this century. It will be so bright that it may even be visible in the day for several days around the time it passes closest to the sun.

The comet was discovered independently by two Japanese amateur astronomers, Kaoru Ikeya and Tsutomu Seki, last month. It is racing toward the sun at a speed of about 375,000 miles per hour and will swing around the sun at a distance of only about 300,000 miles from the sun's surface.

Most comets weaken or break up when they get that close to the sun because of the intense heat. This one, however, astronomers believe, will survive the encounter and emerge even more brilliant as it swings back out into space.

There is some speculation that this comet may be related to the great comet of 1882, which was also a very brilliant object.
