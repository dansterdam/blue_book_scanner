SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO
SIGHTING OF OBJECT
AND LANDING MARKS

On the evening of April 24, 1964, Police Officer Lonnie Zamora was patrolling south of Socorro, New Mexico, when he heard a roar and saw an object descend rapidly, apparently landing in a remote area about a mile and a half south of the city. Zamora investigated and found a small shiny object resting on the ground, approximately 15 feet long and about 7 feet wide, oval in shape. As he approached, two small figures, apparently clad in white coveralls, emerged from the object and quickly reentered it. Flames were then observed coming from the underside of the object, after which it took off rapidly and disappeared from sight. Zamora also noticed impressions in the soil where the object had been resting.
