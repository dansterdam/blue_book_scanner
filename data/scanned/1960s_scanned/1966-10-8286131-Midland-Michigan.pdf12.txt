Here is the text from the document:

Upon its arrival, the object appeared suddenly and silently a a considerable distance away, according to the witness, and it was a large, luminous, round object. As it came closer, it appeared to be the size of a large aircraft, with a dome or saucer-shaped upper portion and a flatter, circular lower portion. The object was brilliant white in color and seemed to emit its own light, rather than reflecting light from the moon, which was visible at the time.

The object maneuvered and hovered, at times appearing to wobble or oscillate, and it moved at a rapid rate of speed, estimated at over 1,000 mph. It moved in an erratic, zig-zag fashion, making sharp turns and abrupt changes in direction and altitude. At times, it appeared to accelerate away at extreme speeds, only to slow down and hover again.

The witness estimated the object was 1,000 to 2,000 feet in altitude and was observed for a total of about 15 minutes. No noise was heard from the object, and it gave off no exhaust or trail. After its final rapid departure, the witness reported that the sky appeared to be distorted or "wavy" in the area where the object had been.
