Children Frightened 
By "Sky Ghost"
LUTHER, ALBERTA, CANADA - Two children at the Fleetwood Elementary School at Lithbridge, Alberta, Canada, have reported seeing a strange, lentil-shaped object in the sky December 1. The children, J.R. Bos and W.J. Allan of Calgary, were interviewed by Mike Williams and Miles White of Lethbridge and forwarded the information to headquarters.
The object, about 70 feet in diameter, first appeared in 1959 and was sighted again on November 23, 1962. At 10:50 p.m. on November 23, 1962, the object was seen by the children and at least one adult.
It was seen again on November 24, 1962 at 6:10 p.m. by a mother and her son, and the Williams boy went to the school on Friday, November 25, 1962. The object was seen a second time on that day. 
On Saturday, December 1, the boy said he saw it hovering over the school yard about 50 feet off the ground. It appeared to be of fantastic shape. The object then shot off in the distance. This was the only sighting that day.
While the object was hovering, children were said to have run into the school's bell tower.
On October 31, the object returned at 8 p.m. and stayed until 9 p.m. and was seen by the children and at least one adult.

Miles White and Mike Williams went to a school, during which Miles warned he would be detained. He blurred, didn't make sense and he fell asleep. He complained first of a "stinging in the head."
A story was published in the papers, but the children and the adults involved were reluctant to talk of their experiences, fearing ridicule.
