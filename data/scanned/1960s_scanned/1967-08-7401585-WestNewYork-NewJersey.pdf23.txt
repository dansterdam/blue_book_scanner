The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. I will proceed to perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document.

Considering: commanding
it had mentioned was object was prom in the eer night,
so strange that in this
found that quite difficult to identify.
Form was fairly large, perhaps 50 to 60 fe et in width and perhaps 15 to 20 feet in height.
colord varied and it appeare
black or dark grey in color. naa
There was a little activity below the object, perhaps a heating or some sort of disturbance,
but it was very faint and difficult to identify clearly.
The object seemed to remain stationary for a short period of time, perhaps 5 to 10 minutes.
It then moved off to the north at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.
I hope this description is helpful.
Sincerely,
