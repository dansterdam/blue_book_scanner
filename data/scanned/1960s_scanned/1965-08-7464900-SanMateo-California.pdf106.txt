35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire as a narrative explanation of your sighting:

My sighting was on May 22, 1965 at approximately 9:30 pm. I was driving alone on Skyline Blvd (a mountain road in central San Mateo County, California) from Pacifica to Woodside. It was a clear, dark night. As I was driving, I noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of me, to the southwest. At first I thought it was an airplane, but it was stationary and much brighter than any airplane lights I had ever seen. As I got closer, the object became clearly visible - it appeared to be a large, circular, metallic object, glowing brightly. It was hovering silently, about 500 feet above the road. As I drove nearer, the object began to move slowly to the northeast, maintaining its altitude. I watched it for about 2-3 minutes as it moved across the sky, then it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. The entire sighting lasted about 5 minutes. After the object disappeared, I continued driving but did not see it again. I was very shaken by the experience, as I had never seen anything like this before. I am a professional person and consider myself to be a rational, level-headed individual. I have no explanation for what I saw that night, other than that it was some kind of unidentified flying object. I reported the sighting to the Air Force, as requested in the questionnaire.
