The text visible in the document is as follows:

Dear Miss [redacted],

This letter your unidentified operation of 12 September 1965 refers to the investigation of an unusual aerial phenomenon observed by you. We have examined the information you provided and conclude that it is the same type provided in many other similar reports received by this office.

We appreciate your interest and desire to share this observation with us. However, since the object you observed appears to be a common aerial phenomenon, we do not believe that further investigation by this office would serve a useful purpose. Your observation has been made a matter of record.

Thank you for your report. We value your contribution to our continuing study of unidentified aerial phenomena.

Sincerely,
MAJOR RAYMOND S. ISKERCEL, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
United States Air Force
