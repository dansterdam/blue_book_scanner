Observed: 
(6) No thunderstorms.
(7) Sharp inversion at 22,100'; temp @ 39,000° -48°C, @ 32,100° -55°C, @ 39,400° -56°C.
h. No unusual activity or condition.
i. No interception or identification action.
j. No other known traffic or balloons.
k. Comments of preparing officer: 1142nd Air Defense Wing Flying Safety Officer. The following comments were obtained from an official of the US Weather Bureau, Spokane International Airport, qualifications unknown. "The length of time the object was observed (10 sec), the fact that the pilot observed pieces break-away from the object and the direction of flight (SW to NE) indicate the possibility the object was a man-made object (satellite)." Reports generally burn out within 2 seconds and generally do not exhibit any visible break-up while they are burning out. However, the pilot could very easily have been mistaken as to the time the object was visible.
l. No photographs or physical evidence available.
