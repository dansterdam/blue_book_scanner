It is felt that the evaluation of balloon (Hot Air) is consistent with the description and flight characteristics of the object.

UFO Description and Flight Characteristics Comments
Wobble in flight (slight roll and pitch combined) Characteristic of balloon flight.
Wispy lines of vapor Probably smoke from burning heat source for balloon. 
Bright red-orange lights Heat sources.
Reflective surface Reflections from plastic bag.
50 ft in diameter Impossible to estimate unless diameter is known.
Explosion and debris 1. Possibly caused by a small directional charge attached to the balloon.
2. Possible misinterpretation of natural deterioration of balloon.
Lack of debris on the ground There would be little left of the balloon. It would not be as far away as observer estimated. Would tend to go unnoticed after descent due to the metallic debris.
Duration of about 5 minutes Surface wind southerly at about 5 knots.
Traveled due south Balloon would be an extremely poor indicator for radar.
No radar contact

5. On the basis of the above similarities, this sighting is to be carried under the balloon category in Project Blue Book files.
