8A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION
FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "!" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED.
[Compass rose sketch with "X" at NW and "!" at NE]
7 . IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE
APPARENT COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. BE SURE TO LABEL THE SKETCH TO INDICATE THE APPROXIMATE
ALTITUDE, SIZE, AND COLOR OF THE PHENOMENON, WHERE KNOWN. FOR EXAMPLE OF SIZE COMPARISON, USE
THE LARGER SKETCH.
[Landscape sketch with "A" and "B" marks and text "Went "west" like a large light, then turned on 2:35 am, irregular."]
