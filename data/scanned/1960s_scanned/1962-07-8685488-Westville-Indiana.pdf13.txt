There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a series of questions and text responses, but no visual image.

Transcription of the text in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" on the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

A seemed to be a rapid movement straight across my sight, no changes in direction.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this test, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

About 1/3 the length of the match stick compared to the object

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

Seemed to just disappear suddenly without a trace.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance.

Because of its rapidity it seemed to be a missile or similar fast moving device. It was hard to tell for sure that color or size just that it came across the sight in a very rapid motion.
