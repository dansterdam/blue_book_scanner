The image contains two illustrations. The first illustration is a compass-like diagram showing the different directions an observed UFO may have moved in relation to the observer's position, indicated by the "X" symbol. The second illustration appears to be a sketch or drawing depicting a person standing and observing an unidentified object or phenomenon in the sky.
