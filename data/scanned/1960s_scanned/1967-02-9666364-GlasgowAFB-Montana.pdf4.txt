SUBJECT: UFO Report, Glasgow AFB, Montana

TO: TDPS/UFO(Major Quintanilla)

1. Reference is made to the subject UFO report(attached).
2. Although the sighting was reported to have been observed on radar, the references to red, white, and blue light beams are not consistent with the radar sighting. Obviously, the references to red, white, and blue light beams and an oscillation of the object with which the radar sighting is associated indicates that the visual sighting is inconsistent with the radar sighting.
