Believes Intelligent Beings on UFOs Sighted in State

"These unidentified flying objects, which were described as 'looking like a mountain lion's head' and colored a reddish or pink glow, have been sighted in this area since Friday when Socorro Police Department's Sgt. Lonnie Zamora said he saw one come down near a dirt road and then take off at great speed.

Mrs. Coral Lorenzen, director of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, turned from investigating the sighting of Zamora which was reported Friday.

She said she was convinced the Socorro sighting, plus other similar ones in the state, were part of an "authentic" series of UFO sightings.

The photos mailed to the director by an unnamed "intelligent" source of Unidentified Flying Objects sighted in 1963 by a shipyard worker were also considered by Mrs. Lorenzen. 

These photos were taken by the worker and show what appear to be "somewhat hazy, but clearly visible" objects, having the color and a glow in the dark, she said.

Mrs. Lorenzen said the incidents which she has investigated in New Mexico since 1952 now point to the possibility that beings from another planet have visited the state.

She claims there are six to eight landings in New Mexico each year and she believes they are made by beings from another planet.

The Aerial Phenomena Research Organization formed by Mrs. Lorenzen in 1952 said the sightings now number into the hundreds in its files, with no reports of injuries or deaths attributed to the "creatures" described as seen during the incidents.
