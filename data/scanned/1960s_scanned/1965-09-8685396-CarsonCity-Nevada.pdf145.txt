Early in 1965, I had a visit from a man who had said that he had seen a UFO. Also, I saw a very clear picture of a man who said he was in contact with beings from another planet. I have more personal experience to indicate that we are being visited by beings from other planets, but the facts I would cite might sound too unbelievable to be taken seriously.
WHAT AND WHERE DID YOU SEE: Aug. 26, 1965 near CARSON CITY, NEVADA. At about 6:30 PM, I was driving approximately 4 miles from Carson City, Nevada, when I saw a large, silvery, circular craft hovering silently above the desert floor, about 400 yards away. It appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter. The craft was motionless for about 2 minutes, then it suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. The whole incident lasted only about 3 minutes.
