The image appears to contain a handwritten document, but there is no photograph present. As an OCR system, I will proceed to extract the text from the document:

THE OBJECT WAS FIRST NOTICED AT 11:35 A.M. EST ON SUNDAY MORNING 25, 1965.
ITS APPEARANCE WAS WHITE AND OVAL IN SHAPE, OUR LOCATION WAS NEAR CAROL CITY, FLORIDA. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 4 MILES AWAY.
IT CAME TO A STAND STILL AND DISAPPEARED AFTER A DISTANCE - STANDING STILL AND GOING OUTWARD AND GRADUALLY BECAME SMALLER AS IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT.
THE SIGHTING LASTED ABOUT 5 MINUTES.
