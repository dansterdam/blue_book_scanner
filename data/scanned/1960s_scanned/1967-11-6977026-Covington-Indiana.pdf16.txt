The image shows a page from an old Project Blue Book report. There is no photograph present in this image. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and extract all the text from the document:

a. A thin black "shell" encompasses the object on three or four points and this shell is probably a halo which is a normal effect when photographing a point source of light. On the fourth point [print (?) ] the object appears to be blurred which may have resulted from camera vibration.

2. The size of the objects could not be determined because distance to the objects is unknown.

3. There is no indication that the images represent anything of extraterrestrial origin.
