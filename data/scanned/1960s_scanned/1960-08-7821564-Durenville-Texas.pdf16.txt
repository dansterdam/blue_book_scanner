Dear Mr.:

Thank you for your letter of September 23, regarding my letter of September 24.

This may be of interest to you. Last night, September 24, at between 7:15 and 7:30, I saw an object in the sky near my home in Durenville, Texas. It was of a dark color, shaped like a half-disk with a dark area in the center. It moved across the sky at a fairly high rate of speed, from left to right, and then seemed to stop and hover for a few seconds. It would then move again, back and forth, in a somewhat erratic manner. At one point it seemed to go behind a small cloud, and then reappear. It would be a rocket on the way to the Moon, I am quite sure. This is an all-too-familiar sighting that I have had on several occasions, but this time I was able to observe it more closely than before. I watched it for about an hour but not able to say it came any closer or went away. I hope this will be of interest to you as much as it was to me.

Thank you; I am deeply interested in the hobby and the research of this matter.

Sincerely,
