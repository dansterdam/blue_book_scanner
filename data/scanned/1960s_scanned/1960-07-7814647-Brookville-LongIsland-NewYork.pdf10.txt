July 5, 1960
Great Neck, L. I.

Dear Sir:

Last evening, July 4th at 8:15 P.M. my wife and I were visiting at Brookville, Nassau County, Long Island N. Y. We observed three distinct circular objects passing rapidly across the clear sky. It was in the view of 3 of us (1 neighbor) for approximately 1 1/2 minutes. They kept a constant formation and about 2/3 the way across the sky one of the three objects changed course, but the other two remained on their same course.

There was no wind on the ground, and they were going in a S.W. direction.

One said it was the color of the moon. I said it had a pearly, glistening reflection. It seemed bigger than the headlight of a car, but I would say they were very easily seen, but must have been far up. One said the edges were fuzzy; my wife, who has very sharp vision, said she got the impression of whirling rings around the object. I was told to write to you by the news editor of the N. Y. Times. I am 35, and was a disabled serviceman. My wife has a Masters in Education from Columbia. We would appreciate that we find out what's happening.
