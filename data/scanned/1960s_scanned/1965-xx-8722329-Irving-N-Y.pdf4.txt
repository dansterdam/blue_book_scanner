near 11 miles and 1/2 from where I am now Siting the object move inclose to the ground about 300 to 400 feet and then move up again to about 1200 to 1500 feet in the air it moved around in diffrent directions and stay up there for about 10 to 15 minets and then just took off out of sight at a very high rate of speed I have seen lots of different objects in the sky but never one like this before it look like some kind of craft or something I dont know what it was but it sure wasent any plane or helicopter or anything like that I wach it close and I dont think it was any kind of mirage or anything like that it was real and what I saw I saw with my own eyes if you want me to go into more details let me know and I will try to describe it the best I can as I saw it.
