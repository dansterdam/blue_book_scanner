SUBJECT: Letter of Appreciation
Upon our request, the Ohio River Division Laboratories provided pertinent information relating to a UFO incident during August 1967. It was necessary to obtain this information in order to prepare the draft report for a UFO investigator of the University of Arizona who also investigated the report and to track up our belief that the sighting was a hoax. The report is one of the most comprehensive scientific reports that has been presented to the Aerial Phenomena Office on a UFO sighting. For this reason, I feel that a letter of Appreciation should be sent to Mr. James McDonald, Chief of the Army Engineers Division, to express our thanks for a job well done.
