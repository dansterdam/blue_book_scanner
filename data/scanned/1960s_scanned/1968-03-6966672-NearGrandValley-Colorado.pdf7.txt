There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows handwritten text on what appears to be a page from a document or report.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

The object was a saucer type object and was within the sky for approximately 3-4 minutes. It was around 10:30 p.m. The other officer that was with me also observed the object. The object hovered in one spot for a few seconds, then moved rapidly away at an extremely high rate of speed. There was no sound heard from the object. The size was approximately the size of a quarter when held at arm's length. The object gave off a glow similar to a neon light. I am an ex-navy pilot and this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this. I am very familiar with aircraft, both civilian and military, and this was definitely not any known type of aircraft. It was definitely not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or any other known type of flying vehicle. The object was completely silent and moved at an incredible rate of speed. I would estimate its speed to be over 1000 mph. I have no explanation for this sighting and I am completely baffled by what I saw that night. I have never before reported a UFO sighting, but I felt obligated to report this incident as I know it was a genuine UFO. I would be willing to take a polygraph test to confirm the accuracy of my report.
