Re USAF RADTCC (Rla Hunt)
Reference is attached letter requesting information on the unidentified observations. The following is a discussed reply:

Dear ras:
We have checked the satellite schedule on the Zcho and those satellites for the night of 4 October 1965 and find that there were a number of satellites in the sky at that time but none of these satellites could have accounted for the observations you described relating to thirty satellites or third magnitude or brighter orbiting the satellite. Thus, whatever you observed, it could not have been any of those other satellites.

As to the sightings of September 14 or 16, it is probable that the observing astronomer was observing a satellite. However, this did not appear moving to the Northwest cannot be associated with that satellite, which would then indicate that a high-flying plane traversing across the sky at dusk could have been the objects you observed.

All known satellites have orbital flights with an easterly component whether Northwest or Southeast and have visual characteristics distinct from what you have described. This Air Force project on unidentified flying objects.
