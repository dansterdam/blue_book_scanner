The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch appears to be a compass rose, with the cardinal directions and intermediate directions labeled. The smaller sketches depict scenes of a person or silhouette in a landscape. Based on the instructions provided, I will not identify or name any individuals, but I can describe the content of the images.

The text found in the document is as follows:

"APR 80-17(C-1)

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENA WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENA WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENA WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN, CONNECT THE "X" AND "Y" WITH A LINE. CURVE OR STRAIGHT, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
