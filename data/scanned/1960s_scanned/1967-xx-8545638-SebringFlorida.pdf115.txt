Bright Object Streaks
Across Westfield Sky

WESTFIELD - Several local residents, including Rev. Davis Gallo and Mrs. Eva S. Aldrich, or 20 Court St., Aldrich, saw an unidentified flying object (UFO) over Westfield Friday evening.

According to Mrs. Aldrich, her husband first spotted the object while they were out for a walk. He called her attention to it and she saw the object which appeared to be metallic in nature and was traveling very fast.

"It was moving so fast that I couldn't tell much about the size or shape or anything," she said. "It just streaked by as fast as you could blink an eye."

She said the object seemed to be an intense white color and had a trail of light behind it. "It was just a bright streak as it went by," she added.

Mrs. Aldrich said her husband first spotted the object at about 7 p.m. The site of the sighting was near the intersection of Union and Mill streets in Westfield.

A spokesman at Barnes Airport confirmed receiving a report of an unidentified object over the Westfield area at about 7 p.m. Friday evening. However, he said they had no further details on the sighting.

The Federal Aviation Agency also received a report of the sighting, but could provide no further information.
