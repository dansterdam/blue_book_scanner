This object seemed to be flying, moving in an eastward direction. Its size was approximately 6 to 8 feet in diameter. Its color appeared to be silver or white, and it had an aluminum-like appearance. At one point it came out of a cloud bank, and as it emerged it seemed to change its direction slightly to the northeast. It was observed for approximately 4 to 5 minutes before going back into the cloud bank and disappearing from sight.
