18. WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE SPEED OF THE OBJECT?
19. WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT FROM YOU?
20. DID THE OBJECT MAKE ANY NOISE? IF SO, DESCRIBE IT. 
21. DESCRIBE THE OBJECT OR PHENOMENON, INCLUDING INFORMATION ON SIZE, SHAPE, COLOR, BRIGHTNESS, AND NUMBER OF COMPONENT PARTS.
THE OBJECT OF SIGHTING THAT IMPRESSED ITSELF ON MY MIND WAS THE FACT THAT IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OR FLOATING IN THE SKY AND IT SEEMED TO BE METALLIC IN NATURE. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TELL THE EXACT SHAPE AS IT MOVED ERRATICALLY AND IT WAS NOT CLEAR IF IT HAD A DEFINITE OUTLINE OR IF IT APPEARED TO CHANGE SHAPES. IT WAS CERTAINLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY AIRCRAFT THAT I HAVE SEEN BEFORE.
22. IF YOU WITNESSED ANY UNUSUAL EFFECT ON YOURSELF OR OTHERS, OR ON ANY ANIMALS, PLANTS, OR OBJECTS IN THE VICINITY, PLEASE DESCRIBE.
23. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY EFFECT ON LANDSCAPE, STRUCTURES, OR EQUIPMENT IN THE AREA?
24. HAVE YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS THAT MAY BE USEFUL IN INTERPRETING THIS REPORT?
I'm afraid that I can't identify the details of the object, but I can say that it was not a conventional aircraft and seemed to be hovering or floating in the sky. It appeared to be metallic in nature, but the exact shape was difficult to discern as it moved erratically. It was certainly not like any aircraft I had seen before.
25. HAVE YOU WITNESSED ANY SIMILAR PHENOMENA BEFORE OR SINCE? IF SO, PLEASE GIVE DETAILS.
26. DO YOU HAVE ANY THEORIES ABOUT THE NATURE OF WHAT YOU OBSERVED? IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL IN INTERPRETING THIS REPORT?
