May 9, 1967

Dear Sir:

I am sending you a sample of a substance I found in our low land in back of our home. I found this while mushrooming. It was concerned on 3 June 1967  and I was wondering if this could have any bearing on this. I find not say anything about this as people think you out of your mind, if you see this sort of thing. I feel however that I should report this now. I left some of this where I found it in case someone would want to see the way it was found. It sound just a little on May 4th.

I would very much like to know what this is if you know. It may be something you can explain right away. If so, please let me know.

Thank You
Williamston, Mich. 48895
