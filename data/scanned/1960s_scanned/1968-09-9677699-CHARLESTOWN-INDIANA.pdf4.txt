27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTION: 
We looked up and saw an object following the train, which was going very fast. It appeared to be silver and circular in shape. As the train moved, the object kept pace with it, then suddenly shot forward and disappeared out of sight. We watched it for approximately 4-5 minutes. It was a bright, clear night. (September 6th)
