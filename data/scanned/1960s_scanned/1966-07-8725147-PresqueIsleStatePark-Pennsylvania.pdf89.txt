ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

Both investigators (Major Hall - Captain Meier) reported discrepancies in the information available to them. The following is a listing of such factors:

1. Who actually saw "black shape"?
2. Description of object quite varied.
3. Who actually walked down beach?
4. The sounds heard varied.
5. Vibrations of car as alleged UFO settled to ground.
6. How did object disappear.
7. Why were persons getting ready to go swimming?
Miss _____ reports they were ready to leave for home at about 8:30.

8. Why were persons parking on that part of beach at this time?

Observers were watching the sky-from inside the parked automobiles - when noticed a bright star. Arcturus was on an azimuth of 275° at a 30° elevation at 1030 EDT, possibly accounting for this observation. Looking back there appears to be a "falling" of a object to the ground.

The girls say nothing but a light in the sky and a glow of light in the vegetation prior to observing the "black shape". One observer, however, provides a description of the alleged UFO. Only male observer allegedly saw object and described as oblong coming from the scenic table which leads to the belief that some animal was responsible for the "black shape" portion of the total picture.

There are numerous bears and raccoons in the area.
