CUYAHOGA FALLS, OHIO: Jan. 9, 1963 - 7:10 PM - Two men and a woman on Portage Trail and Spicer streets, Miss Bowman and Miss Maxwell, both eyewitnesses, when high in the sky, they saw a bright source of white light. The light appeared to be rotating or turning as it was seen towards the general area of Jupiter and the moon. The object maneuvered around Jupiter and hovered for about 5 minutes. Then a second white object which disappeared after a short distance, the first object appeared again but seemed larger. This object was moving from the general area of Jupiter and the moon. After moving erratically and at times stopping, the first object appeared to descend, drop a third white object which also disappeared after a while. The first (larger) object then went out of sight. A man, who was the principal witness, corroborated the sighting. He saw the same objects as described above, and to his estimate, the main object was luminous for about 2 minutes of the 5 minute sighting. He stated that the moon and stars were still visible. No sound was heard by the witnesses. The sighting occurred at an elevation of about 45 degrees in the east.
