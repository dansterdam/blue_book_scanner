Dear Sir:

Enclosed are the clippings that have appeared in The Times Herald in recent issues. These sightings have occurred periodically since Nov. 12.

To date there has been no explainable reason given for these mysterious occurrences.

Our interest is just as great as yours, and if possible I would like to have any information that you have accumulated concerning this matter.

The climes Herald will be glad to assist you whenever possible and for further help or assistance do not hesitate to call upon me.

Sincerely,
John P. Heron
