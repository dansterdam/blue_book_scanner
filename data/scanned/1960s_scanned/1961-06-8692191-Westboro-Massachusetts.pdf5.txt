Dear * * * * *

Your letter of August 22 and addressed to the NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA has been referred to this office for attention. The information you Furnished, while of interest, does not contain sufficient details to warrant further investigation at this time.

In order to attempt an objective evaluation of your sighting, I would need additional information. For example, description of the object or objects observed, time, date, and location of the sighting, weather conditions, number of witnesses, and any other pertinent details. You may return this information to me if you so desire. 

Your interest in this subject is appreciated.

Sincerely,
