I. The foreign telescope sights ex amined were torn from the broken scope of a foreign anti-tank AT rifle about T.B.W. as TE EB by AT force that caused the sights to be torn off or broken away from the scope as against the normal process of dis assembly,

2. The marks on the telescope parts are such that they appear to have been subjected at some time to hydrauliclike force or pressure applied to them. This could result from the force exerted by an explosive charge or the impact of the scope with some hard object.
