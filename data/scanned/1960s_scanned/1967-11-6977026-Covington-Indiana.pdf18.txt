The image contains a photo analysis report document from Project Blue Book, dated November 18, 1967. The subject of the report is an "Unidentified Flying Object" observed in Covington, Indiana. 

The document states that six Polaroid "Swinger" prints were provided for the analysis. The initial review of the photographs revealed that an "unidentified object" was imaged as a "spot of light" in each of the four prints. The photographs were described as being of "poor" quality.

The report discusses attempts to duplicate the star and moon photography with the object, but concludes that the full moon could not have been clearly imaged as it appears in the photographs. It is suggested that the color of the object must be different from the moon, and that the image could possibly be that of the moon.

Finally, the report mentions that on one of the four prints (print #2), the object appears to be blurred, which could indicate a normal effect when photographing a distant object.
