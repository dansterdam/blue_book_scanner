Gentlemen:
My name is [REDACTED] and I would like to submit the following.
On August 22, 1966, at approximately 7:30 p.m., my friend, [REDACTED], and I were observing the moon with my 6" Newtonian telescope (we are both amateur astronomers). Taking a brief rest, we decided to take a look around the sky. We noticed what appeared to be a weird flying object. At the time the sun was setting so features on the object were difficult to distinguish. My friend noticed the object had two green lights. The green light was slightly larger than the white light. When the object was near zenith, the two lights disappeared and only a uniform, yellow, blink-like light was visible. The object was motionless for a time, then exhibited a drifting motion to the northeast. The object had appeared in the west. Period of visibility was about one minute and fifteen seconds.
Very recently I reported this sighting to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and this committee was very enthusiastic about it.
In order that the object might become more clear, I have drawn a diagram of the object below. I assure you this sighting is not a hoax. Would you please give me your personal opinion of the sighting?
Yours truly,
[REDACTED]
