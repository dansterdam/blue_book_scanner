ANALYSIS TEST REPORT
Analytical Branch (MAYA)

SUBJECT: Analysis of Samples From Paved Road
TEST NO: 7-887/888
REQUEST BY: William F. Harley, Jr. - UFOTIDET
PURPOSE: To determine the presence of a flammable material in a sample removed from a paved road surface.

FACTUAL DATA: Samples removed from a road surface were submitted for a chemical analysis. The initiator requested the analysis to determine if a flammable liquid could have been applied to the road surface and the liquid ignited. Sample 7-887 was taken from the burnt area, and sample 7-888 was submitted as a reference sample.

Both samples were extracted with carbon tetrachloride and an infrared spectrum of the extract was identified as a spectrum of the extract from the burnt area, which was identical to the spectrum of the reference sample.

CONCLUSIONS: The extract from the burnt area was identified as asphalt, and no flammable liquid could be detected. It should be noted that a very flammable liquid will burn rapidly and leave no detectable residue.
