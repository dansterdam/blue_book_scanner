On 19 Apr 64, INTELL OFFICER, OLCC, received call about 1400 hrs advising that two people were sighted near Edgewood, New Mexico flying objects in the sky. Told to go to site & investigate. Went to Edgewood & made following findings:
A Sgt, AAFB POLICE, stated he received calls that two civilian workers had seen four objects in the sky near Edgewood. Called local NM Police to investigate. When Sgt arrived at site, the objects were no longer visible.
Two civilians, JOHN SMITH & BILL JONES, reported seeing four round, white objects in the sky over Edgewood, NM about 1300 hrs. They said the objects appeared to be about 20 feet in diameter and were flying at an estimated altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. The objects were observed for about 15 minutes, during which time they maneuvered sharply to the left and right and changed altitude rapidly. The objects then accelerated and disappeared from sight to the south.
