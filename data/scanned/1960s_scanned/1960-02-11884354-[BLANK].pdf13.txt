I recently sat beside Dr. Robert Calkins, president of Brookings, at dinner. Among the items we discussed was the UFO business. He feels that the Air Force should get somebody to take an independent look at this thing, probably some kind of a citizen committee which could review the matter and issue a report in such a way as to get the Air Force off the spot it seems to think we are on. 

I have agreed to sit down with him some time and discuss the possibilities. He says Brookings would be willing to help in whatever way it can. In the meantime, I would like to have your views on what might be done constructively in this connection.
