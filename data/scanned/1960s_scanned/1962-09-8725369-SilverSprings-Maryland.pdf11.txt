The image appears to contain two separate sections - the upper section contains a sketch with instructions and various markings, while the lower section appears to be blank.

The OCR output for the text in the upper section is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion of the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
