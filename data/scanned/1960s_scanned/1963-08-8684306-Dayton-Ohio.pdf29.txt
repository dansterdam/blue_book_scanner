Triangle In The Sky

On the night of 17 August 1963 at 7:30 p.m. (EDT) Mrs. Bradbery, a resident of Dayton, Ohio, reported seeing an unusual UFO in the sky overhead.

Viewed through binoculars from her home, the object appeared to be in the shape of a triangle with a red light emanating from each of the three corners. The object was still in approximately the same position of a few minutes when it began to move. At 7:45 p.m. the triangle was visible again but it had dimmed. The position had changed somewhat in regards to a reference point. The case is similar to a reference point in Baltimore, failed to turn up an explanation.

Unidentified Object Over Beltio

On the same night as the Bradbery sighting Mrs. George Spee of Baltimore observed an unidentified object high in the northeast portion of the city. She reported the object to WBAL investigators and viewed the object from Cheek window for three days. The object appeared to be triangular in shape and pointed earthward and the whole object was red in color. No similar balloons over Baltimore for three days.
