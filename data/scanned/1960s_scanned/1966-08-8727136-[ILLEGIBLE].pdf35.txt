The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page appears to be a questionnaire or report form with questions and space for handwritten responses.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? No, It seemed to just got dimmer and dimmer until we couldn't see it anymore. This happened all of a sudden. 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Absolutely silent
b. Color: White, bluish-white

18. We wish to know the angular size of a match stick held at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment, we would know the size of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing such things as wings, tail, windows, etc., and especially indicate the direction the object was moving. Place an arrow inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
