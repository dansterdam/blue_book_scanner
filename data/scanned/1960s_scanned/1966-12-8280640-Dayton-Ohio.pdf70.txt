My college roomate and myself were returning from the practice of our school choirs. We were outside, it was dark, around 11:30 pm, we observed the object (as to moved very fast above us) for about 10 or 15 minutes. It was a plane, white or silver, kinda oval shaped and climbing and descending at very fast speed, zigzagging a bit. We estimate it was 1500 yards for the city of our home.

Thank you for your time.
