The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document describing an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on September 7, 1968.

I was listening to my radio when I was told there was a U. F. O. When I saw it it was an orange ball. In a couple of seconds it broke up. I thought it was a rocket but it fell apart a lot slower, like it was on fire.
