The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document or bulletin from the A.F.S.O. (Air Force Special Operations) regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting in Antarctica. The document describes the observation of two "hazy" or "fuzzy" objects in the sky that were seen by observers. It mentions that no sound was heard, and discusses the characteristics of the objects as observed through a special photographic instrument called an "all-sky camera." The document also mentions that the observation was confirmed by the New Zealand Scientific and Industrial Research Department.

them much more brilliant that the two others. A kind of "hazy shape" could be seen around the three bright objects. The observers interested in
this possible connection with UFO's. A visual object was observed north of the base, hovering and rotating. It finally disappeared from sight. No sound was heard. The report also states that the observations were made by several persons and certainly belong to the level of reliable observers. It is an important fact of the Hallett Base case that a special photographic instrument called "an all-sky camera" was operated at the time of the observation. This instrument has a spherical mirror that reflects the whole sky at first with an image of a circle which shows a portion of the celestial hemisphere. According to the information received by the New Zealand Scientific and Industrial Research Department, the observer confirmed the visual observation of the UAO. One of the photos of this all-sky camera, showing the unusual objects, was obtained and studied. From the analysis of this picture, it appears that the nature of the object would not correspond to a normal astronomical phenomenon, and there was no information on the fall of a satellite in that region on that occasion.
