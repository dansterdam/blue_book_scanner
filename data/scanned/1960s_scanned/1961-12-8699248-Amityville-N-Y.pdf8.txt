Warrant some more work to be devoted to carefully checking the terrain feature, (certain name?) which at first glance appears to have been drawn in very approximately, and without any attempt at accurate delineation. As drawn, it seems to suggest hills or mountains, but on closer examination it may prove to be something quite different, e.g. a piece of woodland or other natural formation. To determine the nature of this feature would be an important supplementary task in connection with the overall evaluation of this report. Additional corroborative information on this point would be very desirable.
