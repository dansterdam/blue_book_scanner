Fuzzell puzzled: 
Appeared in the "Wheaton Daily Times" on May 19, 1964. He was an official of the telephone company and a resident of this north-central Washington community when a strange object was seen in the sky.

"Sheriff James Fuzzell said an unknown, shining object was reported flying over this area last night by other people, and its origin is unexplained," the news report said. It moved swiftly and silently, he reported.

"It looked like a street light but a little bigger," Fuzzell said, describing the object. "It wasn't any aircraft I'm familiar with." The object was seen for about 10 minutes shortly before midnight, he said.

"Fuzzell said he watched the object through binoculars. He described it as round and bright, adding it appeared to be observing the area from its position hovering in the air on the level," the news story continued.

"Col. Leon E. Emery, station commander at Andrews Air Force Base, said he knew nothing about any strange objects in the area. 'Whether it was a some kind of aircraft or not, I don't know,' he commented. 'I have nothing on that. If we had information, I would certainly pass it along to you.'"
