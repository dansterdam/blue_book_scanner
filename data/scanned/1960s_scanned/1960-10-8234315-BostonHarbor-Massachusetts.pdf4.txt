The object appeared to be from about five to six miles away. It was stationary and hovered for approximately 5-10 minutes. It appeared to be about 20-25 feet in diameter. It gave off a brilliant white light, pulsing, and flashing. It suddenly started moving at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight within 3-5 seconds. The observer described the object as round, glowing and with no wings, tail, or other appendages visible. It appeared to be metallic in nature.
