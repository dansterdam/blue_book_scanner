Text from the document:

Dear Sir,

We had a UFO sighting on the evening of 6 April 1967 in the area of our front lawn. My wife and I were watching TV at the time - only a few seconds because the object attracted our attention. We rushed to the window and saw this brightly lighted object hovering just above the trees. It was perfectly round and gave off a bright light. We watched it for less than a minute and it slowly moved off to the east. At first we thought it might be a helicopter, but it was too big and moved too slowly. It seemed to be in complete control at all times and when it finally disappeared, it did so silently and without any noise. 

Flames were shooting all over the field of fire as soon as we looked out the window. The object was first seen at about 8:35 pm and was in sight for approximately 40 seconds. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me. I would be more than happy to discuss this incident in more detail.

Yours truly,
[NAME REDACTED]
