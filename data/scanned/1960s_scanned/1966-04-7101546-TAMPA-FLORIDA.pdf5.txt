Text output from the document:

3. Mrs. appeared rational at the time of the interview. She is far sighted and has difficulty seeing. It is believed she could have imagined some objects or possibly saw something she thought appeared as she describes. It seems unusual that no other person from the same area (which is populated) observed the same objects. Also, all 11 sightings occurred in the past 3 months.

(The observer's backyard but were different objects with different numbers.)

4. Mrs. has made other UFO sightings while living in Michigan during 1957 - 1959. During this period she sighted 3 UFO's.

It is believed that due to Mrs. poor eyesight and living alone, she probably imagined or thought she saw UFO's or something of logical explanation that her poor eyesight misinterpreted.
