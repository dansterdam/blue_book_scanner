The image appears to be a handwritten document, but it does not contain any photographs. As an OCR system, I will now proceed to transcribe the text found in the document:

Sight and identification were made very clearly and distinctly while observing object. Object was moving at a very fast rate of speed, estimated to be well over 1000 mph. Object appeared to be cigar-shaped, blue-green in color, and was emitting a bright, continuous glow. When the object was directly overhead, it appeared to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in length. The object was only observed for a very brief period of time, approximately 10 to 15 seconds, before it suddenly disappeared from sight, appearing to fade away rather than accelerate out of sight. No sound was heard at any time during the observation. The weather was clear, with no cloud cover, and visibility was excellent. There was no moon, and the object was observed against a background of stars. The observer was an experienced private pilot, and he stated that this was the most unusual and unexplainable object he had ever observed. The observer's name and address have been withheld at his request.
