There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten document or report.

THE SKETCH SHOWS APPAREMT SIZE THRU 16X50 BINOCULARS. THIS SEEMS TO BE THE SAME OBJECT AS DESCRIBED IN REPORT, NO 4.

WINGS WERE APPARENTLY VISIBLE ABOUT 2/3 THE DIAMETER OF THE BODY. THERE WAS NO APPARENT MOTION OR CHANGE OF POSITION ALTHO MAN WHO OBSERVED IT WATCHED IT FOR SEVERAL MINS.

FROM WHAT COULD BE GLEANED, THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT COULD BE LIKENED TO A THIN UNEVEN PLANE SEEN EDGE-ON, WITH A THICK WHITE VAPOR STREAM TRAILING BEHIND THE CRAFT.

NOTE THAT THE NIGHT BACKGROUND AT TIMES MADE IT DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH THE TRUE NATURE OF THE CRAFT AS ITS LIGHTING WAS NOT BRILLIANT, AND CONTRARY TO MANY REGULATIONS.
