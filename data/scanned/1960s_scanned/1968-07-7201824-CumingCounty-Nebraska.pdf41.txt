IOWANS SIGHT 
METEOR IN DAY

An extremely rare sighting
of a meteor was observed over Iowa 
late Sunday afternoon by at least two
witnesses, the Des Moines Register 
reported.

K. R. Newcomer, 2515 Thirty-
eighth St., reported he was driving
on Highway 92 near Martenshale in 
Warren County when he saw a bright
object in the western sky which was fol-
lowed by a yellow center. He 
said the flash was high in the 
west and a little to the north.

What apparently was the
same flash was seen by the
son of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Eder-
son of Randolph, while his 
parents were driving south of 
Fremont on Highway 92. 

The flash lasted only about 
2 or 3 seconds, Newcomer 
said. It seemed to be north-
east of west.

Officials at the Smithsonian 
Astrophysical Observatory at
Cambridge, Mass., the home of
Project Bluebook, said they
were unable to identify the sight-
ing from the information avail-
able to them.

Neither a meteor nor a sat-
ellite had been reported from
another source which would facil-
itate their identification of the phe-
nomenon, the Observatory said.
