There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Recognized text from the document:

"deemed white. I couldn't tell whether or the light was low or bright. It seemed to disappear and then reappear very slowly, but not glow enough to be a satellite. It went from south to north and then reversed direction when it first came into view. When it first came into view, it was not very big, although larger than a satellite, and was out of focus as if the sky was clear. I believe the object was clear.
I didn't make these sightings with the air Force here and I have been a member of the air Force myself for many years. My sightings were similar ones to some of the ones I have seen, but not a perfectly saw these things. This year I graduated from the eighth grade and am 15 years old. My grades are low and I neither smoke nor drink. I have two hobbies: one is reading science fiction and the other is studying the stars and flying saucers. The objects I have seen I believe land and take off again. A few years ago I turned over to the air Force some newspaper clippings I had about UFO's, if you like, I can write to these people and ask them to write to you."
