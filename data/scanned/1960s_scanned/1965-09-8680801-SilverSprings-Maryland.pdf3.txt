The image contains a diagram and sketches, but no photograph. The diagram appears to be related to determining the elevation angle of an object above the horizon. The sketches show a series of objects and an arrow indicating the direction of travel.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the curved line to show the highest point the object reached.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
