Cause Of Power Failure? 
Strange Object In The Sky 
Frightens Youngsters
Woonsocket, Mass. Nov. 10 - Two young boys got a big scare when they saw a strange object in the sky here during a power failure Tuesday night. The incident took place in the Blackstone River area west of here.
The boys, Robert Mason, 8, and Richard J. Paine, 11, told police the strange object hovered, blinding them with light and causing a loud explosion-like noise. During the incident, power was out in the northern section of the city.
The power failure was not unusual, however, and was caused by trees touching power lines, a spokesman for the Blackstone Valley Electric Co. said.
As to the strange object, police said they could offer no explanation. The boys were frightened but unable to give a detailed description.
