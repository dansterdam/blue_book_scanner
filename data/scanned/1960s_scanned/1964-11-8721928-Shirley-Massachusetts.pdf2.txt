DEAR SIR:

I AM WRITING TO YOU ON A SUBJECT TO WHICH I KNOW YOU ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION CONCERNING THIS SUBJECT. LAST WEEK I VIEWED AN OBJECT WHICH SEEMED TO BE HOVERING IN WHAT WESTERN PART OF THE SKY. AT THE TIME I SAW THIS OBJECT THE VISIBILITY WAS PERFECT. ON WHAT EVER IT WAS IT SEEMED TO BE JUST ABOUT 50 OR 60 FEET COME OUT OF THE VASTNESS OF ABOUT 3 MILES OR SPORE. IT REMINDED ME VERY MUCH OF A ROMAN CANDLE. IT WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND RED AND BLUE COLORED SPARKS COMING FROM IT. SPEED THROUGH THE AIR APPEARED TO BE BEHIND IT THEN LEFT A TRAIL OR SMOKE BEHIND IT.
