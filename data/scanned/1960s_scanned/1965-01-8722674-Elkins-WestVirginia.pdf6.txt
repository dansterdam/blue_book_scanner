Dear Dr Menzel,

We received a report from a passenger on an airline flight that an observation was made of two UFO sightings in the Elkins, West Virginia area. This information is sent to you because of your particular interest in this phenomena. Should you feel that this observation is not a Sun Dog observation we would appreciate your professional opinion.
