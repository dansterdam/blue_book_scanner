1. If we accept the report of the photographer that observed this phenomenon then the trails and double image will require detailed analysis. However, the regard his observing an object there are several which may warrant further investigation. It would appear looking through the window the many light reflections could be on the window glass and mirroring into the camera.

2. It is suggested that future UFO photographs be taken before any additional information is requested from the source. This will enable us to obtain some of the conditions under which the photo (taken through window) were made.
