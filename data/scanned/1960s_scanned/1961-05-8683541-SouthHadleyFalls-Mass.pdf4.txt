May 19, CAPT. R.S.V. Alsworth, COM-4
Weather and a fast African airelne

The incident occurred as the plane was flying across the Sudan on a routine flight. The weather was extremely poor, with heavy rain and thunderstorms. At one point, the pilot reported that the plane was struck by lightning. Shortly after, the co-pilot noticed a very large green fireball in the sky, which was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter. The pilot and co-pilot both observed the object and described it as being luminous and surrounded by a corona of ionized air. The object passed the plane on its left side at an estimated distance of about 1000 feet and at an altitude slightly below the plane. The pilot and co-pilot, as well as the flight engineer and a passenger, all witnessed the object. After the object passed the plane, the pilot noted that his directional gyro had tumbled and was not functioning properly. The report states that the object was under intelligent control and was described as being a very large green fireball.
