They say that now and again at times I see thingg that to them are quite queer. I just can't understand (some words blacked out) my mind sometimes wanders and goes on an imaginary journey. One night I looked up into the sky and I saw this round thing come gliding gently and silently. I was really frightened and I ran into the house. I keep watching to see if I can see it again. I am so curious to know what it was. Do you think I was imagining things or could it have been a real flying saucer? I know that people think I am kind of crazy when I talk about these things, but I just can't help it. I saw it as plain as day and I will never forget it as long as I live. Now, I don't want you to think I am some kind of a nut, but I would like to know if you have ever heard of any of these things. Can you give me any information on flying saucers or whatever they are called. I would surely appreciate it. My husband thinks I am foolish, but I know what I saw. Please let me know what you think. Thank you.
