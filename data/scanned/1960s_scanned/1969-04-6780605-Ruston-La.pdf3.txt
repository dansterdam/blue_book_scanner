Dear Sir:
I wish to report an object I sighted in the evening of April 22, but can not identify (a UFO). I would very much appreciate an investigation or identification is possible.
I sited the object on the evening of April 22, about 7:15 pm, coming from the southwest and going to the northeast, after sunset. I was armed with 7-power binoculars from my automobile. I could not discern any details as the object seemed to be covered by some sort of casing or covering which did not allow me to see any structural details. It was bright to the extent that it reflected or seemed to light up the countryside. I am employed at the Air Force Missile Site 585-2-5, and I observed the object from the southwest on the range road as I was returning to the base after completing my tour of duty about 7:15 pm (5:15 pm CST). It was bright to the extent that it seemed brighter than a bright star or planet and was much closer together! Using my telescope I saw this very well. Four darker areas and three triangulars.
Note:
When viewing an object through a telescope, it is quite difficult to discern fine details. This helps explain why I could not see any distinct details on the object.
