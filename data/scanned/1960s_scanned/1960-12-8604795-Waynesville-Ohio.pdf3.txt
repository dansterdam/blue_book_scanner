MEMORANDUM FOR AGENT - IBTH
SUBJECT: UFOB

On 8 Dec 60, Mrs. A. W. Hogan, a resident of Waynesville, Ohio, 13 miles SE of Dayton, Ohio, reported to the Waynesville Police Department that she and her husband witnessed a bright light in the sky on the evening of 7 Dec 60. According to her statement, the light was hovering in the sky and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. Mrs. Hogan stated that the light was much brighter than stars or planets and that it was accompanied by a rumbling sound. She and her husband both witnessed this occurrence.

We enough I ventured no opinion. The witness is an apparently reliable housewife who has no reason to falsify her story. Any additional information that might be obtained concerning this incident would be appreciated.
