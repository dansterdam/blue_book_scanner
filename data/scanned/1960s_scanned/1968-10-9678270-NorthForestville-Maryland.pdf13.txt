DOBO/3415

SUBJECT: UFO Report, 13 October 1968 (your ltr, 22 Nov 68)

TO: TDPT (UFO)
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB
OHIO 45433

1. Through an oversight, the inclosed photographs of the UFO were not forwarded with the AF Form 112. The photos were made with a Polaroid camera and the inclosed copies were made here since the sighter could not loan the originals.

2. The sighting was investigated by the Base Operations Duty Officer thoroughly. There were no radar pickups nor were there any other witnesses. Although the possibility of the sighter is limited as a trained observer, the details in the background as the initial report was given over the telephone. The design of the "saucer" in the photo is familiar to records the Base Operations Officer has seen constructed by local High School students.
