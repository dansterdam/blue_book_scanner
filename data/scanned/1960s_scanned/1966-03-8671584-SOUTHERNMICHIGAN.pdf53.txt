Arrived at the Sheriff's office where Sgt Moody called into the office to find out if Sgt Bryk had called. He said and was informed that he would meet us at the Lamp Post Motel in Ann Arbor at 1:00 p.m. Also, we got a copy of a cartoon that someone mentioned that I had never heard of. The director said they did not have any copies of the newspaper clippings in this district. 

We spoke briefly with Deputy Sheriff McMadden who had witnessed the sighting from about 8:30 to 12:05 pm Sunday night, 20 March 1966. He was the first saw the object due north at Point A on the county map. He thought it was a radio tower light over Oregon which was north of Point B the light was observed in the south. He said the light was about 3/4 mile away. Compared it to size of back end of a truck and about as bright as a radio tower light. We didn't probe too deeply into his sighting.

He said there may have been somebody up at night from there but no records were kept. Sgt Moody asked him if he should pour a note asking if any pilots had observed anything unusual from the air and if they had, to forward the information to U-P ARD and he said he would.
