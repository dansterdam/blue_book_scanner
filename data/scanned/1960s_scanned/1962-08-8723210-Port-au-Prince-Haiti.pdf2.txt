The object was sighted slightly northwest of the town at an estimated altitude of 1,500 to 2,000 feet. It was oval in shape, about 50 feet in diameter, and had a bright, metallic appearance. The object was observed for about 3 minutes and then disappeared to the northeast at a high rate of speed.

The color of the object was shiny, silver-gray. It could be observed against a clear sky and produced no sound. The object appeared to be hovering and made no maneuvers during the observation.

The witness stated the object gathered speed with such acceleration that it vanished from sight within a second or two. The observer was unable to estimate its speed, but stated it was extremely fast. No trails or exhaust were observed. The object seemed to just disappear.
