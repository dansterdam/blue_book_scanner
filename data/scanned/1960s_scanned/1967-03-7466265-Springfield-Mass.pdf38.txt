Dear Sgt. Jones.
My name is ******* I am 13 years old. I am a student at George Dewey Junior High School, Bremerton, Washington. I have quite an interest in UFOs. I would like to make sort of a study on UFOs. I am writing because I would like you to send me some pictures or information of some kind on UFOs. You probably are busy but if you could find time to do this I would appreciate it very much.
I will tell about my experience with a UFO. One night about 9:45 about March 20, 1967 my friend and I were looking at a star in the West. I was about to go in and get a higher powered lens than I looked to the East and saw some kind of object. I called my friends attention to the object. Both of us were scared. It made no noise that we could hear but my dog stared in the area of the object and started to whimper and bark. The object was illuminated but we could still see the outline of the object. It zig-zagged and seemed to take sharp turns. It traveled at about 5 or 600 miles per hour. It hovered over a tree for about 15 seconds then shot up and disappeared. I wanted to call the police or the nearest A.F.B. but my mother wouldn't let me. Thats the story. 
Yours truly,
