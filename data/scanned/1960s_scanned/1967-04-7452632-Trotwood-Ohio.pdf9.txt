The UFO went very slow, wasn't a satellite or anything a man-made. It had lights that changed colors and at times would nearly disappear and then reappear again. It seemed more like a natural phenomenon than man-made. This is real information, not speculation or guesses on my part. I could have seen more details if it had stayed around longer, but it went out very fast, so I couldn't observe it as long as I would have liked. That's it.
