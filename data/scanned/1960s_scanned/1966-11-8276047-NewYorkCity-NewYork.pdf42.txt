The image contains a diagram with instructions and compass directions, but no visible photograph. The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following diagram, place an "A" on the position high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the position show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they moved.

Without a visible photograph, I cannot describe any images. However, I have extracted all the relevant textual information from the document.
