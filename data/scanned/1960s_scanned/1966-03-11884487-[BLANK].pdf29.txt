We've Had No Other Space Guests
AF Secretary Tells Congressmen  
WASHINGTON (AP)--The Air Force secretary said Tuesday that the service has received no scientitie evidence of visits from outer
space and that "we have found nothing."
The secretary, Harold Brown, told a House Appropriations subcommittee the Air Force will continue to investigate all reports.
of unidentified flying objects, but adds:  
"We've had no other space guests that we can find." 
Brown stated publicly there Is no scientific evidence to support the theory that the earth has been visited by intelligent beings from outer space. 
Those reports of unidentified objects, he said, are the result of "sometimes a simple explanation" such as meteor sightings or weather balloons, or else are caused by people's imagination.
Brown steadily declared that the Air Force has not found a single case that would indicate visitors from outer space. He said the controversy over UFOs "hasn't revealed anything new."
The secretary said the Air Force has not turned up any authentic photos of UFOs, and that those alleged photos which have been examined were found to be fakes or hoaxes. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, scientific consultant to the Air Force on UFOs, told the subcommittee he has examined hundreds of alleged UFO photos and has found most to be either fakes, hoaxes or natural phenomena.
Brown stated that even though the Air Force continues to investigate all reports, "we've had no other space guests that we can find."
