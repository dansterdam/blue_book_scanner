15 November 1949
Altus, Oklahoma

The AF-48 report was worried over the sighting. The sighting took place at approximately 8:30 PM on November 12, 1949. The witness, a flight officer stationed at Altus Air Force Base, was proceeding on a routine flight check in a B-25 aircraft when he observed a bright light in the sky near the airfield. The light appeared to be in a stationary position and was observed for approximately five minutes. It was described as a bright, glowing object, somewhat oval in shape. The witness stated that at one point the object appeared to split into two parts, but quickly rejoined again. The object then accelerated at a rapid rate and disappeared from sight. The pilot reported the sighting to the base operations office immediately upon landing.
