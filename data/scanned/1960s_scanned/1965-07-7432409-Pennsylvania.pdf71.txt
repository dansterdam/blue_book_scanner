Young Astronomers Think UFO Is Type Of Satellite
What is the round, glittering object that has been reported over Springfield? Members of "The Spotters," a ground astronomy group, feel it is probably a satellite and not a weather balloon.

The sighting is described in the article. The object was seen at 7:30 p.m. or so. It appeared to be in the sky for 20 to 30 minutes, sometimes stationary and sometimes moving. The astronomers and their scientific friends agree it is not an aircraft, satellite or balloon.

The article also mentions a "big balloon, air force says" incident in Dayton, Ohio, where a sighting was reported and confirmed by the Air Force. However, the Air Force is said to be puzzled by this incident for several days, until it was determined to be a weather balloon.
