The image appears to contain a hand-drawn illustration or diagram related to a UFO report. The diagram shows the silhouette of an object or objects against the sky, with angles and directions indicated. There is also a compass-like symbol in the lower right corner.

The text in the document reads as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the polar shown. Place an "A" on the course that the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the course where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "C" on the course where you think the object disappeared.

28. Draw a picture that will show the position that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the point a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Form a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
