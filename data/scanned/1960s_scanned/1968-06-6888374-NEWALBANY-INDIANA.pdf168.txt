The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document. The text in the document has been redacted, with several portions blacked out.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document, excluding the redacted portions:

Complainant advises that it is observed that this is a definite closed circuit flying object round and gray in color
shape, was observed by a number of witnesses, that it was described as approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter and was hovering and maneuvering above the area at approximately 3000 to 4000 feet altitude.
The complainant describes the object as round in shape, silver gray in color, giving off a slight glow, that it made no sound and that it hovered and maneuvered over the area for some 10 to 15 minutes.
This was confirmed at that time by other witnesses in the area.
After a period of time, the object climbed vertically at a high rate of speed and disappeared.
The witnesses were certain that this was not any known type of aircraft. The Project Officer here has had a considerable experience in aviation and from his observation of the object, he stated that this was where the object vanished and the witnesses observed the ground.
