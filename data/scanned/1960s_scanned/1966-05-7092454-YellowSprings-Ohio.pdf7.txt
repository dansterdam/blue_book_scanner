34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 5 July 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Of the static wave sighted, the area was uniformed almost solely of bright green lights, and sizable mass objects of no reasonable description or identifiable characteristics. I may have seen in grossly inadequate but quite probable actual material craft, but I saw no more than what lights would do in this sort of manifestation. I may not relate or even guess at their purpose, but to do so would be more in keeping with my own imaginative processes than the actual observations. I hope this gives you a clear picture, and please don't hesitate to ask any more questions if you require further elaboration.

I have yours,
