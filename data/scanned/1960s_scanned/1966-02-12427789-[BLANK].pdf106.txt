Reference the balloon which was recovered at Vero Beach, Florida. It can be identified that this balloon was manufactured by the G T Schjeldahl Company, Northfield, Minnesota. This particular balloon was previously launched from Cape Kennedy, not prior to the Gemini G mission. The Schjeldahl Company has supplied approximately 1,500 of these balloons for use in the Marshall Space Center for atmospheric sounding. More detailed information on temperature, pressure, and density of the atmosphere prior to a launch. At times, some of these balloons are launched as frequently as every five minutes during the last hour of the countdown in order to obtain data on wind direction and velocity. Most of these balloons would probably end up over the water due to the prevailing winds.

FOR THE COMMANDER
