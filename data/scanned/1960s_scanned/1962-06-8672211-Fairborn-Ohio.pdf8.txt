The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with a burst of light or energy emerging from behind it. The second sketch depicts a landscape scene with a person standing in the foreground. The third sketch shows a smaller curved shape, possibly representing a similar burst of light or energy.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object appeared later on. 

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its later position to illustrate how it appeared to move.
