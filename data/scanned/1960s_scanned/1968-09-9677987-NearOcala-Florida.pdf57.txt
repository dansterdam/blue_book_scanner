The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

On their approach to Palm Beach they were heading essentially south. As they continued southward, they were still seeing something in front of them apparently.

On their approach to Palm Beach they didn't see it for--I don't know how long a period--apparently they weren't bothered by it after they went over to approach control there at Palm Beach.

So then the second phase of this occurred after Control at Palm Beach notified them that something was following them. And then they made this 360 degree--yes, it says here, "On approach to Palm Beach, the pilot was required to make a 360 degree turn to see if the UFO was still with him." Then pilot saw object at approximately 1000 feet.

Yes sir, the best that we could ever determine it was.

And there was only one object at this time?

Right. Now, one other point, after he left Jacksonville Center Control and went to Miami Center Control, we requested Miami Center to give him position report and everything of his aircraft; and there were aircraft within two to five or two to ten.
