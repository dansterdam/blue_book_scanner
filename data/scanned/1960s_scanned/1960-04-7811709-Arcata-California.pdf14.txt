The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, likely from the 1960s, discussing a UFO sighting. 

The text in the document states:

1. Reference copy of attached letter to Director of Operations, 33rd Air Division, regarding sighting date 21 April 1960.

2. With reference to two photographs with his correspondence, the writer states that these photographs are the results of his sighting on 21 April 1960. Analysis of the photograph by the photographic branch of ATIC led to the conclusion that the sighting did not produce any substantial evidence of anything unusual in the photograph. 

3. Analysis of the photograph by the photographic branch of ATIC led to the conclusion that the sighting did not produce any substantial evidence of anything unusual in the photograph.

4. It is estimated that if the ATIC conclusion differed from his own, he would be contacted in person by a representative from them to discuss the matter further. 

5. It is requested that the configuration and focus of his equipment be unchan ged for future photographs, as the photographs of the same are out of focus by a factor of approximately 5:1 as a result of his equipment.

6. From the information provided by the writer, it appears that the sighting has not been supported by any substantial photographic evidence. However, most sightings which are described as unusual observations do not have such evidence, so this should not be taken to detract from the writer's observations.
