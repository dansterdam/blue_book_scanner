Report of the investigation of the sighting at Eagle River, Wisconsin, purported to have been made on April 18, 1961, by Mr. [redacted] (investigated by Dr. J. A. Hynek, Mr. [redacted] supervised by J. A. Hynek).

Chronological Event:
Higher-powered called me at approximately 10:48 a.m., April 26, to say that he had just been in touch with Judge [redacted] at Eagle River, and that the Judge stated that he had sent some material to Donald Keyhoe and NICAP. Judge Malone said it would be advisable to learn more about the sighting. In view of the fact that we had been strongly urging immediate case liability on the part of the Air Force to investigate when witnesses were ready, it was decided to try to get in touch with the witness immediately. He soon made contact with him, and an investigation was conducted in Astronomy at Northwestern University. A Bonanza single engine plane was hired from Waukegan Airport. However, at approximately 3:40 p.m., arrival was made at the airport, ground transport was used into town to make phone calls. Contacted Mr. [redacted], brother of the editor of the News Review of the Vilas County. Mr. [redacted] attempted to call the principal witness, but no contact was made. Church to ascend would take us out to his farm (cultivated run), about 4 miles out of town. However, [redacted] was not present on our arrival, so we took the opportunity of taking pictures, while Saturn hovered in the sky. Pictures were taken by 35mm Leica and black and white 23 Millimeter by [redacted]. No further sightings materialized and we departed about 6:30 pm and there was sufficient light to take pictures. Pictures enclosed.
