The image shows a grainy, black and white photograph of what appears to be an unidentified flying object (UFO) or some kind of aerial phenomenon. The object in the image is difficult to make out clearly, but it has an elongated, irregular shape with some smaller, diffuse elements surrounding it. The background appears to be a night sky with scattered stars or atmospheric disturbances. The image is marked as "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" and appears to be part of a Project Blue Book document.
