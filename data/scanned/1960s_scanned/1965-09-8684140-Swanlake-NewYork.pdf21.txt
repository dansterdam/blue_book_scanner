Reference the attached UFO report on a sighting made by
prints it to be Copmr. The following is a suggested reply: 

1. Dear Mr. Blunt
A film analysis cannot be computed without the actual negat
length and range (camera to object). Assuming the camera to have
taken the pictures, the distances across the object would be 3.7 inches

It is believed that you observed and photographed a Balloon.
close distances giving the impression of larger size.
balloon are launched from New York City - Albany and Buffalo, New York
reports.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the ai
additional set of prints.
