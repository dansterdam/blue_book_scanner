There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS OR OCCUPATION? Retired.
WHAT KIND OF VEHICLE WERE YOU IN? At Home.
DO YOU ORDINARILY WEAR GLASSES? NO
AT WHAT DISTANCE FROM THE OBJECT WOULD YOU ESTIMATE IT WAS WHEN IT WAS CLOSEST TO YOU? About 1/2 mile.
IN ADDITION TO YOURSELF, HOW MANY OTHER PERSONS OBSERVED THE OBJECT? None.
WHAT WAS THE DURATION OF YOUR OBSERVATION OF THE OBJECT? 1 1/2 hours.
DESCRIBE WHAT THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE. I would compare it to a comet. It had a star like appearance but was much brighter and larger. There were no wings or protrusions.
PLEASE GIVE ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT MAY BE HELPFUL IN EVALUATING YOUR REPORT. I was impressed by the steady luminous quality of the object and the fact that it maintained the same position in the sky for the entire observation period.
