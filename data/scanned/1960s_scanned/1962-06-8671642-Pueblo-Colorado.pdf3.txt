The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document, possibly an old report or document from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

File saw the objects. Was watched by 3 observers in Pueblo, Colorado. Objects were saucer-shaped, silver in color, and moved at a high rate of speed. Observers estimated the objects to be about 100 feet in diameter and 30 to 40 feet thick. The objects were described as moving in a northeasterly direction and making a swishing sound. The observers were able to observe the objects for about 2-3 minutes before they disappeared from sight. The observers felt the objects were under intelligent control and not some type of natural phenomenon.
Sgt was not with observers but later interviewed them and felt they were credible. Sgt recommended that this report be forwarded to ATIC at Wright-Patterson AFB for further investigation.
