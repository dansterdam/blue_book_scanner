Text from the document:

First officer: first saw satellite 
and in a voice of excitement said, 
"Look, look!" Later he said he 
thought it was an aircraft disintegration
as the pieces fell off the main
body they glowed white then 
disappeared. The main body continued
to glow as it descended but with
a glow somewhat less intense the
the pieces that had previously fallen
off. It disappeared completely when about 
45 to left and 30 high.
