2. Associated Programs, Facilities and Personalities
The only solid basis for the estimate of the Soviet effort in establishing interstellar communications is the book "Extraterrestrial Civilizations" published by the Armenian Academy of Sciences in 1965. It consists of 13 papers delivered on this problem at a conference on May 20-23, 1964, at the Byurakan Observatory. The titles of these papers, in many cases self-explanatory, are given in Appendix IV. There are other indications of the Soviet activity as noted in the text of this report but the total amount of information is very small. The Conference was titled the "First All-Union Conference devoted to the Problem of Extraterrestrial Civilizations." The second Conference was to be called in 1965 but there is no further reference to it in available Soviet scientific literature.

A condensed translation of the resolutions of the Byurakan Conference is given in Appendix V. In it there are a number of institutions in the USSR mentioned as suitable centers for the development of various problems connected with contacting extra-terrestrial civilizations. Appendix VI shows two of the large radio antennas in the USSR.

One of the centers listed by the Byurakan Conference is GAIS (Shternberg Institute) where one of the most influential of the workers on these problems, I.S. Shklovskiy, is located. In a condensed translation of the resolutions of the Byurakan Conference is given in Appendix V.
