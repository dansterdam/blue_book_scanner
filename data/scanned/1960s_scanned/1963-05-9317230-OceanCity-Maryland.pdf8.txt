THIS OBJECT WAS SIGHTED IN THE PART BUT LOOKING TOWARD SHORE. IT WAS ABOUT 75 FEET OFF GROUND ON THE AND OFF ON THE END TURNING.

IT WAS NOT THE USUAL ROUND TYPE BUT HAD A FLAT BOTTOM AND SLANTED SIDES. IT HOVERED THERE APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES THEN SUDDENLY SPED OFF AT TREMENDOUS SPEED TOWARD THE WATER.

IT SHOWED NO FLAME, SMOKE OR ANY PROPULSION UNIT. IT JUST SEEMED TO LIFT STRAIGHT UP AND ACCELERATE INTO THE DISTANCE.

THIS OCCURRED BETWEEN 10:00 AND 10:30 PM, AND AFTER CHECKING THE AREA, COULD NOT DETERMINE ANY LOGICAL REASON FOR THIS OBJECT BEING THERE.
