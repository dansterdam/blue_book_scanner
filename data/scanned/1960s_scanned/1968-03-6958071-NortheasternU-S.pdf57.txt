Last night, March 34, 1963, I stayed over night with my cousin, as we had planned in advance. He had wanted me to visit him and his family for some time. Upon arrival we settled in and made myself at home. Then about 8:30 p.m. the children and I went outside for some kind of recreation-colored object fly across the valley. About two or three minutes later my wife came running up the house yelling and pointing telling me about the same thing. I immediately went outside and watched very, very carefully for about one half an hour. The object came up over the tree tops or mountain range and it was absolutely still, stationary, for several minutes and then shot off towards the west again very, very clearly, and was just a blur in a few seconds. All colors of the rainbow, red, green, blue, yellow were visible on this object. It remained stationary from horizon to horizon, very bright and seemed about the size of the business end of a lead pencil held at arm's length. It would have been seen very, very clearly by all those enjoying the good weather outside their homes in the area. I was reminded of the UFO near the windows I would have seen them them. As I indicated, my cousin, the children and myself all saw the object and it had remained stationary and then shot off towards the west as I mentioned before. We called the air base and reported the sighting and it had been reported on the outskirts of Medford. We compared notes with five other observers and the intelligence observer from the police station, who interviewed us the next morning. They asked us many questions. I'm quite sure that the other five observers and myself know the UFO was there. But the other five observers and myself know the UFO was there.
