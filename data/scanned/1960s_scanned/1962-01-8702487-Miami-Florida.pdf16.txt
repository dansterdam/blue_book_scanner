FROM 10 Bomb WG (DCOI)
HOMESTEAD AFB, FLA.

1. The following is a Photographic Analysis of print 1/1-V/U marked in orange on the UFO sighting 26/2/52. Analysis is based on the 19th Bomb Wing Photo Lab, Homestead AFB, Florida. Each alphabetical letter is keyed to the correlating information on the photo.

A. Dust on raw film when exposure was made (leaves black mark on print).
B. Dust on negative: when print was made (leaves white marks on print).
C. Scratch on negative (as this doesn't show on print, the negative was probably scratched after the print was made).
D. Unknown foreign matter stuck to back of film (this is not a negative photographic image).
E. Unscored : probably star tracks on both are exactly the same length as they would be during a time exposure of the night sky. The reason for only one set of them showing is the unscored of the film caused when developed or printed.
F. UNKNOWN - The following are possible:
1. Aircraft: The changing position of the four UFO objects could be caused by aircraft in different positions in the air.
2. Rockets: Rockets as well as aircraft are being used for the same survey projects.
3. Man-made satellite: either passing over, going up from the launch site or coming down through atmospheric friction.
4. Meteorites will fall and break up the same as satellites only usually at a faster speed.
5. Still UFO.
