The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document describing a sighting that took place on March 9, 1967 in Tawas, Michigan.

The text in the document states:

her son, and two daughters saw the object through a window. It was very large, oval, and carried red, green, and yellow lights; it flew low over the house, and then seemed to drop suddenly behind the trees in a field north of the house. They have not been out to that field to investigate and do not intend to go.

The sighting which stimulated the investigation took place at 7:10 p.m. on March 9, 1967. The ladies were outside looking for UFOs as they do quite often, when they dropped her eyes toward the horizon a little south or west, and saw a bright pulsating red object hanging in the air, just above treetop level. It was apparently closer than it seemed, and soon they looked too. The object was shaped like a pancake, with a rim made of red lights which seemed to pulsate irregularly. The top was rounded, but there was no high dome on it. The object approached closer, and suddenly it seemed to explode. A brilliant white core of light fanned out from the object toward the witnesses, so bright that all who were watching (two adults, two teenagers, and four smaller children) had to cover their eyes: "That white light - I don't know what it was, I've never seen anything like it." The ladies were visibly upset during this initial recounting of the incident; one had tears in her eyes.

The white light lasted 10 seconds (by re-enactment), and then turned suddenly off. The red pulsating lights were again visible for a few seconds, and then the object accelerated very rapidly off to the north, disappearing behind trees in the northwest, or about 50 to 60 degrees from where it was first seen. Angular diameter was impossible to obtain, although the witnesses said that the "nowastorm" object had been much closer and clearer.
