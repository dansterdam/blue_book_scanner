The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter dated December 16, 1964 from Major Maston H. Jacks of the USAF Information Division Office of Information to an individual in Temple City, California.

The text of the letter is as follows:

"Dear Mr. [redacted],

There has been no evidence received or discovered by the Air Force indicating that there are such things as 'flying saucers'.

Attached is a copy of AF FM Form 164 which is used for reporting UFO sightings to the Air Force. This should be filled out as completely as possible and returned to this office for evaluation.

Sincerely,

MASTON H. JACKS
Major, USAF
Administrative Branch
Chief, Information Division
Office of Information"
