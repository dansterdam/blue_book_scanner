The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram rather than an actual photograph. The sketch shows a curved path along with a compass-like diagram. There is no photograph visible in this image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you lost sight of it. Place on "C" on the compass when you first saw it. Place on "D" on the compass when you last saw it.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

25. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
