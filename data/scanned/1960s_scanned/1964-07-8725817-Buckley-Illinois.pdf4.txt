HEADQUARTERS
FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION 
AIR FORCE SYSTEMS COMMAND
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO 
28 JUL 1964
UNCLASSIFIED
SUBJECT: FOR UFO INFORMATION
THRU: USAF CLASS 03 (NEW DATATT) 7072 - 04 
TO: 30 JULY 1964

1. Reference is made to the attachment to letter, dated 7 July 1964, subject as above.

2. It should be pointed out that the duration and time sequence pertaining to any UFO sightings which are reported are of definite importance. The passage of time between initial observation and final disappearance may indicate the operational status and effectiveness of the vehicle. While their size and speed may be of interest, it is doubtful if, at this stage, they will aid in determining the general description of the UFO.
