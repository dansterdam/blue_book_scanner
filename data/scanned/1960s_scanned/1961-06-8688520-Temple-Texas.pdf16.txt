There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing a form with questions about the observer's sighting of a UFO.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:
