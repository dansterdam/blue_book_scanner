Saturday, 8 June 1961 
The witness, a field investigator for the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), reported observing a bright, elongated object hovering over some 
trees approximately 100 feet from the witness's position. The object was said to be approximately 30 feet in length and 10 feet in width, and it appeared to be more rectangular than circular in shape. The witness stated that the object made no sound and the surface appeared to be metallic in nature. The object was observed for about 2-3 minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view. The witness's estimate of the size of the object was said to be smaller than the larger UFOs reported.
