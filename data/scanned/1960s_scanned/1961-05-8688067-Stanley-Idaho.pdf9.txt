The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text produced by the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "T" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size of the object. If you had performed the experiment at the time that the sighting took place, how much of the object would have been covered by the end of a pencil held at arm's length?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that we can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a narrative which will give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
