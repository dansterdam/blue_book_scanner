COMMENTS: Sighting of object is reliable for it has been seen by more than one person. Since the interview this object can be seen the night of May 8, 1964, over Thibodaux for no other reports have been received in surrounding areas nor can it be seen from ground level. We were unable to detect any object on our radar. FAA has an airway, V-227, over Thibodaux and stated that VRF aircraft use it but they could not confirm any scheduled aircraft at time of sightings.
