Information Only - Flying Saucers, Aug 64 

On the morning of Sunday, 14th July, 1963 Mr. Frank Selwood of Albert Road, Parkstone woke at 3 a.m., and on looking out of his bedroom window saw what he believed to be a steady object in the sky. For hovering over a gasolder at the back of his house was a huge cigar-shaped object "about as big as four terraced houses."

Mr. Selwood unsuccessfully tried to wake his wife, Mrs. Selwood returned to the window to find the object still hovering about 300 feet from the ground. In the middle distance, the flickering became blue-green lights. From the object came a "humming sound, like a quiet sort of whistling."

It continued to hover for almost three minutes and then suddenly appeared to rise into the air. The motor and the flashing light began continuous along the object's entire length. It then moved off at a fantastic speed.

Friends and relatives to whom Mr. Selwood spoke about his experience did not believe him, and suggested that he had a bad dream. But he has talked about the incident so much since that they realize that he did see something, and that it was no dream or hallucination.

This sighting was made three days before the news of the Charleston crater was reported in the newspapers.
