Text extracted from the document:

"No sir, it didn't. It was always over the middle of the road, possibly 50-75 feet off the ground.

You had to look then, did you have to look through the top part of your windshield or middle or how? 

Well, it was towards the upper portion of the windshield.

So you were looking up and the object was against the sky then.

Right.

Okay, when you say it was white, was it a uniform white, or was it fuzzy at the edges, or what?

It was sort of a yellowish-white, I guess similar to the sun on a bright day; the outer edges seemed to have a fuzzy texture to them, it was nothing that was very clear cut and defined.

Now, was the...did you at any time see an object connected with it or was it always just a light.

It was always just a very large light. I never could see any metallic surface or definite characteristics ...

Yes, this occurs, your report as strange and unusual as it is, is by no means . . . doesn't stand by itself; there have been many other cases like it reported, and I'm, of course, in my own work searching for patterns between various cases. Okay, please go ahead.

Well, the first thing that I noticed was before I actually sighted the light, was the fact that my radio, WCKY in Cincinnati completely faded into static, which is very unusual because I can usually pick it up very clearly at night. But before I had tried to adjust my radio to may be find a station again I saw this light, and I first noticed the light there."
