Case No. 8684555
Tyndall AFB, Florida
8 May 1961

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object
1. On 8 May 1961, a report was received from Lt XXXXX, 4750th Air Defense Squadron, Tyndall AFB, Florida, concerning an unidentified flying object observed in the sky on that date.
2. Lt XXXXX stated that at approximately 1810 hours, he observed a bright, star-like object in the sky, high above the horizon, approximately northeast of Tyndall AFB. The object appeared to be stationary, and remained so for approximately 10 minutes. At the end of this time, the object suddenly increased in brightness, began moving to the northwest, and within 2-3 seconds, disappeared from view.
3. No aircraft or other known objects were in the immediate vicinity of the observed object at the time of sighting.
4. No photographs or other physical evidence were obtained of the object.
5. It is the opinion of this investigating officer that the object sighted by Lt XXXXX was most likely a meteor or other natural astronomical phenomenon, and does not represent evidence of an unidentified flying object of extraterrestrial origin.
