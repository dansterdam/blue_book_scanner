The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten text response to a questionnaire. The text appears to be a personal statement about an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

Here is the transcribed text from the document:

May have trained with me off the airway, about where I guided the flight from inside the car where the light came through the windshield near the car almost. May have wanted to know the car thinking they might have to act to defend themselves. The car area was a stop for me unexpectedly that I reported that the object was thought to have slowed down and appeared to be located.
