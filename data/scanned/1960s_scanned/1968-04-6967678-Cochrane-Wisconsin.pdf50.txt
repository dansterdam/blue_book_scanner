Leitha - 16
Can you - maybe I'd better ask him what he said, and how he - and then I'd like to ask you a few more questions before we sign off, so if I could talk to- it would be fine.
Hello.
Hello, how are you?
Fine.
This, of course, has been some time now since all this happened, but you probably still remember it pretty well, don't you?
Yes.
What did you think about while the whole thing was happening?
I was just scared. 
Did you say anything, or were you just too scared to talk, or what?
I was just too scared to talk. I just watched it, it just stayed up there.
Did you think that it was going to harm you?
Sort of.
Now, let me see. From the standpoint of color, what color did you think it was?
Reddish-orange.
Reddish-orange also. So you heard your mother talking. Is there anything you'd like to add, or anything that you think could be corrected a little bit.
Let me ask you this, did it get hot in the car?
Yes, it did.
What I really should have asked you, I know it got hot, what I should have asked is how hot. You've been in very hot rooms at school or someplace, how hot - just how hot did it get?
