The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a document with a series of questions related to the observation of a UFO.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Vanished

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound: No sound b. Color: Reddish orange and amber 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 5/8

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch all details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially any trails or motion. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The document also contains a hand-drawn sketch of the object, showing an oval/elliptical shape with an arrow pointing in the direction of motion.
