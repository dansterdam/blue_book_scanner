The image appears to be a page from an old document containing handwritten text. There is no photograph present in this image. As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the output of all the text found in the document:

10/6/65
This report appears to be routine. The item or phenomenon sighted on 10/6/65 and reported by the observer was apparently not an unidentified flying object but rather some other natural or man-made object. The report itself does not contain information which would lead to the conclusion that the sighting represented anything extraordinary. Accordingly, it appears that no further investigation of this particular incident is warranted.
