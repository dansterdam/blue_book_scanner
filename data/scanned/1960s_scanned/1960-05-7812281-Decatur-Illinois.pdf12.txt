The image does not contain any photographs or visual material. It appears to be a text document, specifically a memorandum from the Congressional Inquiry Division of SAFIL, addressed to Major Kelly.

The text of the document is as follows:

MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY DIVISION, SAFIL
ATTENTION: Major Kelly

SUBJECT: UFO Inquiry - Miss [redacted]

1. Miss [redacted]'s latest letter addressed to President Eisenhower and the file on this individual be marked closed.

2. Miss [redacted]'s letter is completely disjointed and indicates a great amount of hysteria on her part concerning various objects she sees in the sky.

3. If you feel you must reply to Miss [redacted] in order to return the photographs she again submits through the White House, you might again state that the original negatives of the photographs are needed together with the information stated in our letter of 25 July.

4. In this instance, it probably would be much better to file all the correspondence together with the photographs and mark the file "closed."
