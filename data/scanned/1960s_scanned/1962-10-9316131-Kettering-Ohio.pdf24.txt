The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line on the top of the page labeled "A" that depicts how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows a larger view with a person on a road surrounded by trees and a smaller sketch in the corner.

In response to the request to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document, here is the text:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
