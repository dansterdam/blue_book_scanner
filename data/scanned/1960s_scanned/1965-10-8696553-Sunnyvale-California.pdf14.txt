The image contains a photograph that appears to be a part of a UFO report document. The photograph shows two blurry images of what seems to be an unidentified aerial phenomenon in the sky over the South Bay region. The text accompanying the photograph describes the event as a "UFO Crossing South Bay Skies?" and mentions a "Routine Photo, Then... A Bright Spot Appears" during the shooting of the pictures.

Routine Photo, Then... 
A Bright Spot Appears

It was developing these negatives from a shooting assignment in Sunnyvale, California, when the photographer Gary Gillis said "a bright spot showed up" while shooting the pictures, and that this "knowledge would make the above image." The picture was taken with a series camera at 1/250th of a second, and the text mentions the names of Toni Villani and Carol Weston, who were present during the incident.
