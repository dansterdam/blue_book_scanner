Obviously such possibilities require the harnessing of the whole energy of the sun of which the earth intercepts now only one part in two billion. Projects of this sort are in existence, one of them being Dyson's Sphere to capture and retain the energy of the sun. The utilization of the galaxy will then be the next problem.

Kardashev sets up a classification of civilizations according to the energy criteria as follows:
(1) Technological level approaches that of terrestrial civilization: consumption of energy 4 x 10^19 ergs/sec.
(2) Civilization utilizing the whole energy of the star, that is, of the order 4 x 10^33 ergs/sec.
(3) Civilization, having at its disposal the energy of its galaxy, is about 4 x 10^44 ergs/sec.

Further, Kardashev, basing his argument on our own experience, thinks that Stage 1 is reached in a few billion years. Stage 2, according to him, should develop within several thousand years after Stage 1 had been reached. Stage 3 should be developed in not more than 10 million years after Stage 2. Thus indicating that the 10,000 years postulated by Shklovskiy for the existence of a civilization is not satisfactory to at least some Soviet astronomers.

The evidence of the existence of a civilization of Type 3 would consist of radio phenomena which could not be explained in any
