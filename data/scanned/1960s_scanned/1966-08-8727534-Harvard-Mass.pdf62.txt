Dear Sir:

I am writing in connection with the enclosed FORM. This FORM has been sent to the USAF and they have instructed me to sign it and return it to you.

(C-A-37501) seems only to request identity for the individual and so is being returned unsigned.

I am unable to identify this FORM and so cannot sign it. Would you please have this FORM clarified and returned to me with any additional information you may have?

Sincerely yours,

[Signature]
