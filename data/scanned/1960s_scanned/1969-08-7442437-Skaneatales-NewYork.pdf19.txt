Text from the document:

The analysis given here of the observed phenomenon when early seen. 
The witness stated that the object did not appear to be solid, to have dimensions, or to have a spherical shape. It appeared to be elongated, with an irregular or indistinct shape. The object was very bright, and its brilliance was so intense as to appear almost dazzling.
The only movement that was observed was a direct, steadfast motion from left to right. No other movement such as undulating, oscillating, or jerking motion was seen.
The observed object was close and low to the horizon and appeared to be close to the trees and the ground. When first seen it was directly in front of the observer.
