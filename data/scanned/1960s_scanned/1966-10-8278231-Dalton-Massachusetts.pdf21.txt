35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific point under consideration:
I covered in detail the first sighting on Oct. 6 - we saw these strange lights at an altitude 300 ft or less, toward the southeast, a bright red and green streak of light moving rather fast from west to east - the white red and green lights could be seen easily on Sunday Nov. 6/9 - 11 or 12. We stars could be seen, only a thick fog-like haze dropped down below the horizon and it was brighter fluorescent white - but a thin ray of light would make blinking red light on the bottom part of the cloud. My brother-in-law and I were excited and drug up a camp chair to keep a steady look out. I appeared at about 9:30 pm and lasted until it got daylight. Compaired to the moon in the sky it was about 1/3 the size of the moon at breakfast time they are not so few as they are in between 2 to 4 am.
