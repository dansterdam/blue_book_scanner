"MYSTERIOUS HOLES

Strange happenings in July, and none were sightings of flying objects. They were, however, rather weird, to have been reported in the same general area during the same week. In the villages of Dersett and East Lulworth, in Dorset and East Somerset, respectively, peculiar holes were found in the ground, as if some object from the sky had made them and then simply disappeared, roots and all. A few in Dersett were large enough for a man to walk into. One of the farmers came across one of the holes almost 3 feet wide, near to a river. He was unable to discover what could have made such a hole.

Only one of the holes has been thoroughly examined under the fishboroughs' head order. For some unknown reason, they decided to hide their findings.
