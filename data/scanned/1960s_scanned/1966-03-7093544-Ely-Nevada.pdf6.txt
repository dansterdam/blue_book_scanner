A bright round light, blueish-white in color, pulsating and giving off small orange sparks or flame-like particles. The "light" appeared to be about halfway between me and the mountains in the distance, but I could not judge its exact distance or size. It seemed to be pulsating with an irregular rhythm and emitting the small orange "sparks" from its edges.
