The following information is provided in order that you may answer Dr. ****'s questions: Maryland (phone) regarding this sighting:

a. We apologize for the delay in replying. No apparent explanation was available when we received the information of this sighting.

b. A copy of his report was sent to Dr J Allen Hynek of Northwestern University. Subsequent investigation resulted in contact with Mr. Arlo J. Vebey of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

c. On 24 Jul 63 three research balloons were launched from Palestine, Texas. These balloons carried an instrument package with an automatic triggering device to separate this package after 100 hours of flight. One of these packages was not recovered. After 102 hours the track was lost with the balloon heading towards Canada, back down through Maine and New Hampshire. After 102 hours the track was lost with the balloon heading towards Canada, back down through Maine and New Hampshire. The flight path could have taken it in the vicinity of Maryland at the time of his sighting. The package from this balloon was not recovered to confirm the identification of this sighting as this balloon. However, all other aspects of the case indicate that this is a possible cause of the sighting.

d. We are attaching two articles from the Science Newsletter, indicating the establishment of the above program.

e. Should Dr. **** desire further information regarding this program, he may contact Mr Vince Lally at Boulder, Colorado.
