Sirs:

While working in my field last spring, and again a few days ago, I found some small deposits of tin foil. I believe these foils have been dropping from unidentified flying objects. I can't identify what they are, and they seem to me to be quite strange, and what they were used for, I don't know.

If you thought they were of any importance, I would be happy to send you some.

Thanking you, I am,

Very truly yours,
