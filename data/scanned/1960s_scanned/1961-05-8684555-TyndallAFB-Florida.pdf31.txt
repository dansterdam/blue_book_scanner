Text from the document:

During the early hours of May 20,1961 for over 30 minutes, a strange, round object, glowing orange-white, which manoeuvred over the drone(pilotless)target on the ballistic missile range. The UFO was tracked by two air force radar stations. When the UFO was near observation post their radar equipment failed, consequently from electronic-magnetic interference generated by the device. After attempted interference the UFO climbed every time the base tried to obtain a range on it. The UFO disappeared in a downward direction and during the period that it was under observation it did not remain stationary for more than a few seconds at a time.
