From what I can tell, it was a slight, oblong span people saw, apparently for just a few seconds, passing very quickly. This does not resemble most aircraft visually encountered, except in the general outline. Its motion was erratic. It appeared to be luminescent rather than reflected light. The duration was quite brief. Its course and speed were unusual. Some of its maneuvers suggested the object possessed flight characteristics not common to ordinary aircraft. A "peculiar" aspect was noted, but specific details are unavailable. This is a complete report to NICAP, a co-operator of UFOB sightings.
