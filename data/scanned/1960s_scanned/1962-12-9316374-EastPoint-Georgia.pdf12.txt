April 3, 1963

East Point, Georgia
Dear Mr. -------:

Thank you for your interesting letter of March 23 regarding your observations of an unusual object observed on December 31, 1962.

As you stated, this incident occurred during twilight. It seems within the bounds of possibility that the object you observed was the result of a balloon, the sun's direct rays at first and then as twilight deepened the silhouette of the balloon became visible. This effect on balloons at a high altitude is well known.

However, in case this is not the explanation for your observation, we are returning the copy of your letter to you as requested in your initial observations of this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Alex. B. Godfes
Moonwatch Recorder
