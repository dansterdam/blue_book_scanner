Dear sir,
I am writing you this report on a UFO sighting I had last night. It was approximately 8:30 P.M. and I was standing in my backyard looking up at the stars. Suddenly, a bright light appeared in the sky, traveling at a very fast rate of speed. It seemed to be metallic and oval shaped. The light was brilliant white in color and emitted no sound whatsoever. As it traveled across the sky, it made a sudden 90 degree turn and then accelerated at an incredible speed, disappearing from sight within a matter of seconds. 

The entire incident lasted less than a minute, but I was able to observe the object clearly. I am a former Air Force pilot and I can say with certainty that this was no conventional aircraft. The speed, maneuverability and lack of any exhaust or sound lead me to believe this was some kind of advanced aerospace vehicle, possibly of extraterrestrial origin.

I hope this report is helpful in your investigation of this incident. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me.

Sincerely,
[Signature illegible]
