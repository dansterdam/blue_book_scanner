The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass-like diagram with directions labeled around the edge. The second sketch contains two landscape scenes - one larger scene with a person standing in the distance, and a smaller inset scene of a person looking towards a distant light.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF TRE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" AT THE COMPASS POINT TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE OBJECT MOVED.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. ALSO DRAW A DISTANCE SCALE AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE TO INDICATE THE
APPROXIMATE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT FROM THE OBSERVER. SHOULD THE OBJECT SUBTEND A GREATER ANGLE THAN
THE LARGER SKETCH, MARK THIS ON THE LARGER SKETCH.
