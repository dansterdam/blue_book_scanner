Dear sir:

Sights of an object and below are among the details on the latest sighting to be reported here. You might thank a what was most likely a UFO flying against a rain shower which passed nearby. This may be a flight of another craft of earthly make that is the work of our scientists.

The object was sighted going east to west at an estimated 15 to 20 thousand feet and moving at an estimated speed of 400 to 500 mph. Its shape was elliptical and it was bright white in color. It seemed to be around 35 to 40 feet in diameter. Its duration was approximately 5 to 7 seconds.

We sighted an object going east to west at a considerable altitude. As we were standing looking northeast, the object suddenly appeared and shot across the sky at a tremendous rate of speed, making no sound. It seemed to be glowing a bright white color as it crossed the sky. The duration of the sighting was only 5 to 7 seconds. I hope this information is of some value.
