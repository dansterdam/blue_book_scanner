There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document that appears to be part of a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Text extracted from the document:

I believe that the noise of the house a simulteneous, reduced the sound of the object coming. The noise eliminated much of the silent, soft-sound, moment when it passed overhead. 
The impression which I received told me, more or less, where it was located, but from your letter, I do not appear to be on the 7th of July, a little distance to the north from the a drive by Girard Municipal School, next to the loading docks. 
It sheared seemed to be flying at an altitude of about seventy to eighty feet from the ground. A bright light, or lights, moved very, very fast, and it was a little hard to get used to something like this at first. I was not the only one who saw this phenomenon, and he told me, apparently, what it was, but I do not remember exactly what he said.
