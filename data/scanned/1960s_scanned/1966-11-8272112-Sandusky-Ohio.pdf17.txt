Dear Sir:

Reference your letter requesting information on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) sighted in this area. A comprehensive investigation has been conducted and the evaluation indicates that no objects could be related to the blackouts.

In accordance with your request, no additional information will be added to the present data case; however, a comprehensive investigation is not possible since the sightings are considered isolated incidents.

Thank you for your letter. Your interest in our program is appreciated.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.
