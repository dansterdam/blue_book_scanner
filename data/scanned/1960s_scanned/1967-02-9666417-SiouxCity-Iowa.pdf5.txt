The text of the document is as follows:

"On Tuesday, January 24, 1967, USAF Capt. George Fyffe, Project Blue Book Investigator, interviewed Irene Lair and Jeroldine Armbust, two residents of Sioux City, Iowa, concerning a UFO sighting they had on February 9, 1967 at approximately 8:00 p.m. The interview was conducted at the girls' home.

The girls stated that as they were driving home from work on the above date and time, they observed a bright white light on the horizon. As they approached the light, they could see that it was a circular object with a reddish-orange glow around the edge. The object was hovering and seemed to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet. They said the object was silent and did not seem to move.

They watched the object for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. During this time the reddish-orange glow dimmed and the object appeared to be rotating. The girls stated that they were frightened by the experience and did not get out of the car to get a closer look.

When they arrived home, the girls immediately contacted the Sioux City Police Department to report the sighting. The police department in turn notified the local Air Force radar site, who picked up the object on their radar. The radar operators stated that the object was on the scope for approximately 15 to 20 minutes before it disappeared from view.

Capt. Fyffe stated that the girls appeared to be sincere in their report and that there was no reason to doubt the validity of their account. He concluded that the object they saw was an unidentified flying object."
