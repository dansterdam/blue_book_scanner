The image appears to contain a photograph, but I do not see any human faces that need to be described. The text in the document is as follows:

Analysis of UFO Photograph

AFCIN-131
1. The attached photograph, taken by Pvt (E2) _____, was forwarded to AFCIC by your office for analysis.
2. Analysis of the photograph indicates that the photo was probably caused instead of the building and reflection of a great circular light in question is probably a reflection on the window from a light hanging from the ceiling. The inside of the building creates an elliptical shape and the strong white area in the top central portion is the light bulb which also gives off a reflection.
3. Attached is the transparency for forwarding to the original owner. The full address of the owner is:
26th Military Police Company
Fort Gulick, Panama Canal Zone
