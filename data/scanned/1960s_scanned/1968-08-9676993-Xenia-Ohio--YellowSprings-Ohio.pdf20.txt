There is no photograph present in the image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a transcript of an interview or conversation.

All of a sudden it was there.
I was traveling north on . . . . . Road.
You were traveling north and you think the thing came up from behind?
Well, it's only logical explanation I have because I didn't notice it until all of a sudden.
As a girl all by myself, I was somewhat scared because first of all I never could be believer in UFO's, not really, and I didn't want to be taken to some population as quickly as possible.
So you never stopped the car. You just kept on going.
I stopped the car periodically because I got the idea that this was following my lights, so I got out of the car and I started running toward the farm, and I noticed it was stationary.
Well, it depends on how large the object is. I'm just guessing - I don't even know - maybe 300, maybe a little larger.
I should have asked really how apparently large was it. That is if you had held say, an aspiring tablet or arm's length, it will just cover the moon. Now if you had taken a dime, it would hold it out and estimate how much of the object it would have covered at arm's length.
As the time it was directly over, maybe 1/50 of it. (As the time she felt it was closest). When it shot off into the distance, it went about 1/4 to 1/2.
So much of the sky did it seem to block out? You know how large the full moon appears in the sky?
Definitely at the first sighting of it it was larger than that. I do want to say that when it was overhead it did seem to have a fog or a mist or something around it, the center part being stationary and the outer part having a rotating motion.
Were there any other cars on the road?
No. I was the only one that I could see.
You were about how far from home at the time?
