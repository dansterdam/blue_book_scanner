33. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the investigation is presented here.
THERE VIERE 7/TO OR HZ VEHICLES WHICH 711VERT1 VERY LOW, ABOUT 15 FT OFF THE GROUND, CIRCLING TIT? AREA. THEY SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 30 FT IN DIAMETER AND DISC SHAPED, LIGHT GRAY IN COLOR. THEY MADE NO NOISE AND NO VISIBLE EXHAUST.
THEY SEEMED TO MANEUVER, APPROACHING AND GOING STRAIGHT UP, RATHER THAN LEAVING HORIZON7ALLY. I LOOKED AT THEM FOR A FEW MINUTES AND DECIDED TO NOTIFY STATE POLICE WHO CAME OUT.
THEY INVESTIGATED AND CALLED IN THE NEAREST AIR FORCE BASE, BUT I LATER LEARNED NOTHING WAS EVER FOUND ON RADAR. THE STATE POLICE HAD CALLED THE AIR FORCE BASE BEFORE I ARRIVED, BUT THEY COULD NOT LOCATE ANYTHING. I BELIEVE THESE OBJECTS WERE REAL AND POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED AS CRAFT EMITTING NO VISIBLE EXHAUST AND MANEUVERING IN A MOST UNUSUAL FASHION.
