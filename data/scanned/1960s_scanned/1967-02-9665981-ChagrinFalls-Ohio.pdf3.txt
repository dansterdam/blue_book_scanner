The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document with text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract the text from the document:

Time was about 9:30 PM on the date mentioned above. First noticed a strange light in the sky which appeared to be moving. It seemed to be about the size of a dime at arm's length. As it drew closer it appeared to be quite large, possibly 20 to 30 feet in diameter. It seemed to be glowing, not flashing. It moved slowly at first, then seemed to pick up speed, and then came to a complete stop. It hovered for a few minutes, and then appeared to move away slowly, dimming as it moved into the distance. It made no sound that could be heard. The object appeared to be disc shaped.
