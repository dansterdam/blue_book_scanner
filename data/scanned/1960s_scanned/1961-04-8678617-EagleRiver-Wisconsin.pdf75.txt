The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document states:

The results of these tests indicate that the material was obtained (from a source other than terrestrial) which is not common to the local area of Eagle River, Wisconsin.

This information is helpful. Should you require further assistance or wish to see the investigation file on this case, please let me know.
