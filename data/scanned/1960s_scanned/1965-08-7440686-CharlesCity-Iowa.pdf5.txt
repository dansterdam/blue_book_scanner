The image on this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book does not contain a photograph. Instead, it contains a sketch or diagram showing a curved line with various angle markings and a compass rose.

Here is the text that has been produced by the OCR system:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object or objects were above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object or objects were above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
