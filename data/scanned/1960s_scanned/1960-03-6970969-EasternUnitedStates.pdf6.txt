Text extracted from the document:

This was why Downey guess to Smyrna for some, which could have been anything from 13 to 160 miles. The basis of our sound direction to site was probably erroneous.

About 2:30, my initial observation, lasting about 10 seconds, showed the object to be elongated and bright, apparently traveling very high and at great speed. In my opinion it was not a conventional aircraft, meteor or satellite. The object was not accompanied by any sound. I could see no wings, flames, or exhaust.

Mr. Brown P. Whit is now observing and advises that he can detect no visible distinguishing features. On this interval, 6:40 The T-34 had started a climb, and CFEDCA, taking control, joined on the target. Mr. Brown P. Whit observes that the object remains on the same heading but appears to be considerably lower.

All the planes had the same vector, Egon converge: his, a mighty one 9:10 descent from cloud to 5,000. And Singleton, who for B whisk was invisible, Coghill. Than Zsl then. Given consequently, that Singleton was interfering between Singleton and Shimada was more image than the former.  

Please confirm the name of the observer as "Brown P. Whit"
