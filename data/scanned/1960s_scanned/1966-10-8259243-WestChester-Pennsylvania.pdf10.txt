The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten page from a UFO report document.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

The page states:
"He turned to the house and called Martin at 11:30. Asked CCNY Coastguard for 10 secs. to get back to house but got tangled up with them. They said they were working a FIRE. PROCEDE WITH RADER AT THEY SEEM TO HAVE RECEIVED TRANSMISSION FROM OFFICER IN CHARGE TO DO SO.
