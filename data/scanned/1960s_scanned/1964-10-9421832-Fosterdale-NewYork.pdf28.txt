16. Tell in a few words the following information about the object:
a. SOUND - None heard except for LOW-FLYING AIRCRAFT
b. COLOR - Dark gray or black

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Include in your sketch any details of the object that you may wish to describe, such as size, shape, color, etc. Draw an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were: 
(Circle One): 1. Fuzzy or blurred
2. Like a bright star
3. Sharply outlined

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, the how many were there? If a single object, put a check to show the direction they were traveling.
