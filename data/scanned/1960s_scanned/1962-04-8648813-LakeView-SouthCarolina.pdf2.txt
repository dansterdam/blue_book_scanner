Dear Sir:

On April 2, 6:00 A.M. eastern standard time, I was on my newspaper route and I saw something I could not identify. I was about 30 miles from the town where I live, and I was facing east. The sun had just started to come up, and the sky was partly cloudy. I saw a large object hovering over the ground about 40 degrees with the horizon. It was a silent, steady light, not blinking. I watched it for about 3 to 5 minutes. It seemed to be about the size of a small private plane, but I could not make out any details. After a while, it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared into the clouds. I did not hear any sound from it. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this, and I am very much concerned about it. I would appreciate it if you would let me know if this is a known phenomenon or if you have any information on it. 

It was 12 years ago that I had a similar incident and I am worried.

Sincerely,
(Signature)
