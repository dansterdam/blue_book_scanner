Text from the document:

April 22, 1965

It is rather unusual to solicit help on this picture of an unidentifying flying object. However, there are a few items that need explanation to discount reports and little green people.

It is nearly impossible to discount reports of little green people. They have communicated knowledge of the situation, and that they prefer to remain incognito as they have been with us over many centuries, and twenty-one days prior to this date. Heaven's gate was set up, and a group of people were eliminated... Prior to this date, Adam walked out of the Garden of Eden on three occasions, and became the first man to have witnessed extraordinary beings from another planet, and returned to tell the tale. These celestial beings looked human as we do, but had extraordinary powers and abilities. There was a familiarity. There has been one space ship that operated on the Salton sea, and was a scientific discovery.

However, the scientific world is being carefully controlled by beings from another planet. The magnetic force, and its impact on our civilization, is the force of population. it is the force of population that keeps planets in their orbits, and inter-star, and inter-cluster. After a civilization has reached a certain point with their development, that force of population becomes a cosmic control, and is redirected so the planet progresses to the next step of its evolution. The only ones to worry about are cosmic cowboys, and shooting galleries.
