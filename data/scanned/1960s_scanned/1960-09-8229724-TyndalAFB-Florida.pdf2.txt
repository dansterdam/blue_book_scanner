(8) Unusual Features: I have observed other satellite trails, but this object seemed to be different. It did not behave at all like the various satellites.

3. Description of Course or Object:
a) At approximately 1900 local time an object was observed that appeared to be over the Gulf of Mexico south-southwest of this base. It was observed for approximately 10-15 minutes by 2 competent observers. 
b) The object appeared stationary at first, then seemed to move north slowly, and finally moved in a fast erratic course southwest and then disappeared. The object appeared to be under intelligent control and operated in a manner completely different from the various satellites observed.
