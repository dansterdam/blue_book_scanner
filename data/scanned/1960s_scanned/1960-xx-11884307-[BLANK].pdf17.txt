The image does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, specifically an incident report. The document contains text and signatures, but no visual imagery beyond the document itself.

WASHINGTON, RADAR SIGHTING:
(1) In the Department of Defense "Project Blue Book" special report No. 14, Major General John A. Samford, in a press conference held on 29 July 1952, commented that this case was one of the best documented cases in the files of Project Blue Book. This case is the result of a combination of radar and visual sightings, temperature inversions, and other phenomena which tend to produce unusual and unexplained radar targets that, in this case, were visible on the radar screen, in a random manner from the normal radar returns, indicating movement and size changes over the radar scope, in a random manner. 
(2) It should be emphasized that no photos or motion pictures were ever made of this sighting.
(3) The attempt to represent the target as representing extraterrestrial space ships, carefully playing "tag" with the radar, is an unsubstantiated conclusion, not supported by fact, nor the radar scope was unscientific, not supported by fact, nor the conclusions of the Air Force.

SPARKY CASE: This office has NO FILE on this particular case, regarding an observer's affidavit.
