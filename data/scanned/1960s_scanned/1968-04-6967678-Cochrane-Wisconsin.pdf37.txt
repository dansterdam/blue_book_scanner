H:I don't know what went wrong, but something did. At any rate, where were we? Oh yes, the car in front of you had just stopped and the lights went out.

L:Well, I thought it had stopped because all of a sudden there were no lights, you know, at about the time this thing came above it, and it was in the road, you know. Except it wasn't this object; it was above the telephone posts; I remember that, above that height -
