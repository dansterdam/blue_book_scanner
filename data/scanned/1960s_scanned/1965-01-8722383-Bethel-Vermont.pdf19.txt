The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document or report related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

I. ANALYSIS: Photographs were investigated but none were obtained. Witness reporting is considered very good and reliable.

II. THE UNBRANTED METEOR SHOWN:
A. DATE: Maximum - January 3 - 4
B. DURATION: Object was observed for approximately 4-5 seconds.
C. DESCRIPTIO: Compared to other stars, the object appeared larger, brighter, and of longer duration. It descended obliquely to the west at an angle of about 30 degrees to the horizon. a. The speed was estimated to be about 30 degrees per second which would indicate a high velocity.
b. The object appeared to be of saucerlike shape and at the time it seemed to pulsate or throb. 
c. The color was a brilliant white or whitish-blue.
d. No trail or exhaust was observed.
e. As it approached the horizon, it seemed to increase in brightness and size.
f. At that time it disappeared suddenly and completely. No fragments or debris were observed.

D. CHARACTERISTICS POINTING TO OUR CONCEPT OF METEORS IN THIS CASE:
A. SPEED: Despite the very high rate of motion, this is consistent with the known high velocity of meteors.
B. BRILLIANCE AND DURATION: These are not unusual for a bright meteor.
C. TRAIL: No visible trail. Very unusual for a meteor.
D. SHAPE: Such of it was seen, the saucerlike shape is not typical of meteors.
E. ALTITUDES: An apparent significant drop in altitude during the sighting is not common meteor behavior.
