Dear Sirs:

I would like to report a sighting of an object on a night at the end of June at about 10:10 p.m. My family and I were driving south on route 22 toward Easton, Pa when this object flew slowly over some trees on the right of the road and crossed the road to a field where it banked downward and hovered over a field. The thing passed, in front of the moon about 300 feet and the outline was that of a submarine without a conning tower. There were no fins or wings and that is what made me believe it wasn't an airplane even though there was an airport nearby. There was a white light in the front and rear and two red blinking lights came on as it crossed the road. My mother wanted to stop but the traffic was heavy and she couldn't. The side of the road was dark. I never thought of remembering the date.

That isn't the main reason I've written. What are the results of the investigation of the Presque Isle Park sighting where picnickers saw a UFO with tripod legs land. I understand a Maj. William S. Hall of Youngstown, Ohio, Air Force Base investigated and took plaster casts of the indentations on the beach attributed to the tripod legs. Was the sand firmly packed by the weight of the object or what was discovered? From the Associated Press photo, it appears to be about two feet in diameter and maybe four inches deep. What could have made this indentation?
