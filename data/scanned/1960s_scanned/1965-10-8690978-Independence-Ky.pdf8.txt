Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent. I reported a sighting I had to the local police and they said they would report it to the Air Force. I then got the impression the Air Force wasn't very interested in it although I would have given them any information they wanted. I saw a disc shaped object, it was white, with ropes hanging from it, and it was making a whirring sound. It was solid, noiseless, and without visible means of propulsion. I watched it for about 10 minutes, it was about 700 feet away. I would be glad to give any information on this sighting.
