(A diagram showing angular measurements and a curved line is present)

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

(A diagram showing an object's flight path is present)
