The image does not contain any photograph or visual representation. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book, that contains a form-style questionnaire with checkboxes and handwritten responses.

The text in the document is as follows:

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
START SLOWLY AND PICK UP SPEED THEN SUDDENLY TAKE OFF AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE IN COLOR?
GIVE OFF SPARKS OR GLOWING EMBERS? 
CHANGE IN SHAPE OR SIZE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
MAKE SHARPLY BANKED TURNS?
MAKE A NOISE? 
MAKE A WOBBLE MOTION?

WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
the noise that drawn my attention

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It went straight up

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
YES

The handwritten answers indicate that the observed phenomenon moved in a straight line, made a wobbling motion, and disappeared by going straight up. It was also observed to move in front of something like a cloud, tree, or building.
