The document describes his observation of the light, which he said was stationary at first and then began to move rapidly across the sky before disappearing. The report notes that Powell was an experienced observer and did not believe the light was an aircraft or any known object. The document concludes by stating that the sighting was entered into the Project Blue Book records.
