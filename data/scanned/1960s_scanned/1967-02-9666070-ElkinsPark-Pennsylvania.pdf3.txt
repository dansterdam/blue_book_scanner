This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that contains text describing various photographic data, such as the type and make of camera used, the type and make of lens, the brand and type of film, the shutter speed used, the lens opening used, the filters used, and whether a tripod or solid stand was used. The text also mentions that the exact direction the camera was pointing with relation to true north, and the minimum camera data required if supplemental information is unavailable.
