Dear Major Quintanilla,

This letter is written on purpose only, in my emergency to reach you. Matter when we first last from the formation that has seen, to write.

Every night since October 6 to you at the Vanderfiled Airforte. They approach 7:30 p.m. and at 10 p.m. and 11 there are three caddies witnessing who waited them from Pittsburg. I would them from Dalton. And each other out by phone to sight them October 6 at the U.S.A.F.

To be at the altitude of a type plane. It just made out brilliant red and sometimes its blinking red and then after remaining station."
