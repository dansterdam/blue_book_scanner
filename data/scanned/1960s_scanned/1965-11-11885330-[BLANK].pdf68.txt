The image shared appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a table with technical details. The table is titled "Component Heat Loads (Watts)" and lists three components - Target, Analyzing Magnet, and Chamber Magnet - along with their conduction load, radiation load, total load (300째K), and total load (230째K).

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

TABLE 2
Component Heat Loads (Watts)
Component Conduction Radiation Total Load Total Load
Load Load (300째K) (230째K)
1. Target 0.7 3.5 4.2 3.7
2. Analyzing Magnet 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.22
3. Chamber Magnet 0.63 0.16 1.09 0.60
