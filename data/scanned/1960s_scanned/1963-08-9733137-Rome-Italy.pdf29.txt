REPLY TO: TDEW
ATTN OF: S:30JFT R:r:pjm FOR UFO INFORMATION (ITALIAN EMBASSY)

TO: MR USAF SAR-OI'S (MRS GAISER)
WBAB 25 D.C.

1. Reference the attached letter from LT S 30 OCT 63 and a General Report on "Unidentified Flying Objects" which was presented during a recent Air Force Scientific Advisory Committee meeting.

2. The information on the report was presented in Italian. We were unable to obtain copies of the specific cause of the sighting. There is a possibility that the witness observed a "reflection" of a ground light which was mistaken for a flying saucer. We have no firm conclusion as to the cause of the sighting.

3. A copy of this report has been sent to Dr J Allen Hynek (Civilian consultant for the Air Force's UFO program). Perhaps he will be able to determine what the object was.
