There does not appear to be a photograph present in this page of the UFO report document. The image shows only handwritten text describing a UFO sighting.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

"2. What time did the object(s) first appear and how long was it (they) visible?
I saw the object first at approximately 10:45 pm, on the night of April 4, 1967. It was visible for about 15 minutes.

3. Describe the object(s) in detail. 
From the minute I first noticed the object, it appeared as a bright glowing sphere or orb of light. It seemed to be hovering motionless about 45 to 50 yards above the ground. The light was so intense that it cast a reflection on the ground and surrounding buildings. There were no protrusions or appendages visible, and no sound could be heard. The object remained stationary for several minutes and then suddenly shot straight up into the air at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from sight. I would estimate the diameter of the object to be approximately 30 to 40 feet.

4. Where was the object(s) in relation to your position? 
The object was directly over a nearby housing area, approximately 3 blocks from my location. I had an unobstructed view of the object from my position.

5. What was the condition of the sky at the time of the sighting? 
The sky was clear, with a few scattered clouds. There was a nearly full moon, providing good visibility.

6. Please add any other information that may be helpful in evaluating your sighting.
I had been outside walking my dog when I first noticed the bright glowing object hovering motionlessly over the housing area. At first I thought it might be a helicopter or some other type of aircraft, but the lack of any sound and the intense bright glow of the object soon made me realize it was something most unusual. As I continued to watch, the object suddenly accelerated straight up at a tremendous speed, far beyond the capability of any known aircraft, before disappearing from sight. This was a most amazing and perplexing sight, and I can offer no conventional explanation for what I observed that night."
