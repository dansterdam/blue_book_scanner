Text extracted from the document:

Dear Sir: 

I was of the opinion that my previous letter had been lost or misplaced and have since made inquiry at the local post office as to its whereabouts, but have received no reply as of this writing. Therefore, I am taking the liberty of enclosing a copy of that letter for your information and consideration.

As you will note therein, I reported sighting of an unusual aerial phenomena on the night of March 4, 1968, at approximately 8:15 P.M. The object, which was brightly illuminated, appeared to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter and seemed to be hovering or moving slowly over the area. It was observed for a period of approximately 15 to 20 minutes before disappearing from sight.

There were several other witnesses to this phenomenon, and I would be pleased to furnish the names of those persons should you desire to contact them for further information. At the time of the sighting, I was in the company of my wife and several neighbors, all of whom can attest to the facts as I have presented them.

I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this communication and any information you may be able to provide concerning the results of your investigation, if any, into this matter. 

Sincerely yours,

Redacted
