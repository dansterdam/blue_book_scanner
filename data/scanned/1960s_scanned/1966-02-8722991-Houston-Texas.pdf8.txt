This image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The image depicts an angle chart or compass, along with a sketch that appears to show the motion or trajectory of an object.

The text in the image is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path, or "B" is the end-to-end direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
