REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
EAGLE RIVER, WISCONSIN
APRIL 14, 1961

At about 11:00 a.m. on April 18, _____ was having a late breakfast in his home. (See picture) when he heard a noise which he described as a "car going around a curve in a great hurry." He said it was actually like a jet. It was dazzling, and, he said (some time later) that ___ had told him that it had made a sound like a crackling motor. The noise seemed to be the sound as it made its way while coming down was in a whirling sound "like a jet." Apparently he said it was on its way down it sounded like "swooshy tires on a wet pavement," and that the object and any disturbance of the air seemed to be circular in shape, and the motion of the object which he described as two soap boxes, one overturned on the other, stated he was not frightened by the apparition, but was out immediately, because of his curiosity. When he got there, they had all disappeared, and he stated that the hatchway opened, something like a trunk of a car that it hinged from on top and the lower lip would coincide with the center of the ship. He stated this when it opened it was completely impressive, and that he would have sworn there was no possible opening there. The space ship as drawn by him is enclosed. When he came out, an occupant or said vehicle was leaning out of the hatch and making motions with his hands cautioning that he passed that he made some other liquid. That is, he drank a drinking motion. He was handed down a "thermos-like bottle" (see drawing) which he says was quite unlike any she had the time ever seen before. "A beautiful thing," he said.
