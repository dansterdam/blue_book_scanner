Text extracted from the document:

The witness stated that she was about to turn in for the night around 9:00 pm on the evening of May 6, 1965 when she noticed a bright light outside her home located on Strawberry Lane, Lynn, Massachusetts. The light was hovering over the nearby woods, approximately 150 feet above the ground. The witness described the object as disc-shaped and silver in color, with a bright, rotating red light on the bottom. 

The witness watched the object for several minutes before it suddenly shot straight up into the sky at an incredible speed and disappeared from sight. The witness was very shaken by the experience and reported the incident to the local authorities immediately afterwards.
