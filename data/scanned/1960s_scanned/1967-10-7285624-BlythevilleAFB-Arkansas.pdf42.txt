Dear Major Quinlanilla:
Two letters from you March 18 and another one April 7 will all be answered in this letter.

First, with regard to your question: The University of Pennsylvania Observatory reports for 1967 OCT 22-28 and 1968 FEB 22-28 observations of an object designated as a Blimp. This object has been observed by other observatories as well. It appears to be a conventional blimp, most likely a commercial advertising blimp, which was sighted between 0516 and 0622 EST. I have so informed Dr. Hynek at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

The first observer at our Observatory did not recognize the object as a blimp, but through additional observations, particularly on February 22-28, we were able to establish conclusively that this was merely a conventional blimp. The fact that it was never reported from a point of vantage to and from the object made it difficult to establish a firm identity earlier. Neither the Arkansas reports nor data given these are pertinent. 

Secondly, a report by J. Hertenstein for 1968 FEB 25 20:22 GMT was in correct format and has been forwarded to the proper channels. His report will be included in the official file.

If you can get the reports of the sightings on 1967 OCT 22-28 and 1968 FEB 22-28, I would be very glad to get it, as then I might be able to complete the partial information I now have.

Sincerely yours,
