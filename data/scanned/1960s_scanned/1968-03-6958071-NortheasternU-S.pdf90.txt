The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten letter. The letter describes an observation of a "figure-shaped object" that was sighted on March 3 at approximately 9:45 pm, about 25 miles west of Elizabethtown, Kentucky. The observer states that the object appeared to be "vertically ascending" and that it became more ghost-like in appearance until it was no longer visible. The letter is signed by the observer, whose name has been redacted.

March 4, 1968

Dear Sir:

On March 3, at approximately 9:45 pm - we were 25 miles west of Elizabethtown - coming in on the Western Ky Parkway. When we sighted a figure-shaped object directly ahead - slightly to the left of the North Star.

The object appeared to be vertically ascending. When first sighted it was brighter and as it climbed more ghost-like in appearance until it was no longer visible.

Hope this will be of some help to you.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
