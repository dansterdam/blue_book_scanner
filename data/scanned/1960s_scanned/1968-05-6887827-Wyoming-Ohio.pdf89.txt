The object was first noticed by myself and another family member while sitting on the porch looking north. The object was sighted approximately 8:30 p.m. E.S.T.

This object appeared to be oblong in shape, extremely bright, emitting a strong light which appeared to be changing in color from red to green to yellow. The object seemed to be stationary at first and then started to move in an erratic pattern, sometimes appearing to go straight up, then sideways, then down, then up again. The object continued to move in this erratic manner for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. 

After this time period the object started to diminish in size and its intensity of light began to decrease. The object finally disappeared from our view behind some trees on the north horizon. 

This object was not an airplane, helicopter, satellite or any other known flying object. The size of the object, its intense light, and the erratic manner in which it moved, convince me and the other observer that this was not any known type of aircraft. We are completely at a loss to explain what this object could have been. I submit this report in the hope that your investigation may shed some light on this very strange occurrence.
