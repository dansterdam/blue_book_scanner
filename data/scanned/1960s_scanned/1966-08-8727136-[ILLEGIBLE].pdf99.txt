14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The observer reported that the object disappeared like the moon.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The observer circled "Yes" indicating that the object moved behind something.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The observer circled "Yes" indicating that the object moved in front of something.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - None
b. Color - White

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with the known object. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The observer did not provide a response to this question.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or any flashing lights on the object as it was moving.
