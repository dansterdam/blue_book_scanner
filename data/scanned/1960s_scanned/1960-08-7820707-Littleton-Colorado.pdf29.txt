The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

Near midnight, August 13, 1960, Red Bluff (Calif) police officers CHARLES A. CHASE and STANLEY SCOTT watched an oblong object with red and white side lights hovering in the eastern sky directly ahead. Among its characteristics: silent hovering, rapid and acute maneuverability, lights incapable of identification as any known aircraft. 

The officers, keeping a watch which lasted more than two hours, radioed a local Air Force radar station and got a swift, startled reply: "unidentified." Civilian authorities with calm powers of observation expected law enforcement officers watched the object—occasionally beaming its lights to the ground—until it vanished below the horizon.

On August 13 at Corning, California where police officers chased a red-lighted UFO for 2 hours the following was reported: Twice the unknown machine approached the police car, one of its red lights beaming the ground like a searchlight. One policeman swung their searchlight upward, and the descending UFO swerved away. Throughout the encounter, a static-like roar drowned the police radio. In the meantime radar screens at the nearby Air Force Base at Red Bluff, California reported a good "hard return" of the unknown on their screens, which indicated a solid object in the vicinity.
