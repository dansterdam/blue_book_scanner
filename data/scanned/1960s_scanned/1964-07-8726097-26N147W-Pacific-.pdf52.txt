This is a case of which no photographs were obtained. The witness, a retired GP, Cornliton, Newlyn, Penzance, Cornwall, reported seeing an object maneuvering slowly at a high altitude over the sea near the southwest coast of Cornwall, England, on June 25, 1964. The object was described as being shaped like a flat disc and emitting a bright glow.
