Proposed reply to UFO report from Mr. [redacted]

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is a replies to your recent correspondence concerning your unidentified observation. Examination of the submitted data fails to reveal a positive identification, primarily because of the lack of essential data such as flight characteristics, angular velocity, and how the object disappeared. 

No other unidentified flying object reports were submitted to the Air Force from the vicinity of Clawson, Michigan for 5 February 1967.

At this late date a meaningful scientific investigation is not possible. It is important for us to report his or her observation to the Air Force as soon as possible after the sighting. This enables Air Force analysts to perform a comprehensive investigation. The submitted information will definitely be added to the present data for possible future reference.
