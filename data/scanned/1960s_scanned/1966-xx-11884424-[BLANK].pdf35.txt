Headquarters, United States Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Major Steiner:

With reference to the meeting at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, there are several reports of ATIC, Project Blue Book, or related groups which would be available for inspection and discussion at that time:

(1) The report of the 21 April 1955 events at Kelly-Oakville, Kentucky, (2) the report of the alleged Brazilian naval incident of March 1958, and (3) the February 1949 report of Project Sign's unidentified flying objects. I would be glad to discuss these and other matters with you at your convenience.

With best wishes,

Cordially,

Carl Sagan
