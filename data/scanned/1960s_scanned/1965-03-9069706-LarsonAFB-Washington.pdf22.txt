Dear Mr. Taylor:

This letter is in response to your letter requesting information on an unidentified flying object.

Mary-E., a registered nurse employed at her home in Meadville, Pennsylvania, has asked that we submit your request for her information. As you indicated, the Air Force's investigation of this incident revealed no evidence to indicate that such an event actually occurred. 

It is possible that the incident was investigated and resolved to the satisfaction of the individual involved. However, we are unable to indicate what the final disposition of the case may have been.

Sincerely,

A. Ataa
