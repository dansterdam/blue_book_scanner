NICAP MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING SUBCOMMITTEE
13 Friend Court
Waltham, Massachusetts
December 17, 1965

AFSC - PID
Macan-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Attention: Project Bluebook

Sirs:
Enclosed is a UFO Report for your perusal. One of our investigators has concluded that the object sighted was probably the planet Jupiter and he most likely is correct, but since Hanscomb AFB received another UFO report in the same general area of this sighting, I thought you might be interested in this one. It would be very interesting if the other sighting reported to Hanscomb AFB was of an object similar to the one described in the enclosed report.

Sincerely,
Raymond E. Fowler
Chairman: NICAP MASS SUBCOM
