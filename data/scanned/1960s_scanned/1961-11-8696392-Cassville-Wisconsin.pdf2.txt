The text reads:

OBJECT: Watching an object first appearing as a point of light, approximately 4.0 miles south of east in Cassville, Wis. at 8:09 p.m. on November 8, 1961. It was 5.5 miles distant and 30 miles east of Prairie du Chien, Wis.

The object appeared to be moving on a north northwest course and became larger and brighter as it approached, until at 8:12 p.m. it was approximately overhead at a distance of 1.5 miles. The object then started a slow descent, oscillating slowly from side to side, and became much brighter and larger until at 8:14 p.m. it appeared to be approximately 0.5 mile in diameter.

At this point, the object started emitting a series of rapid flashes of light and then descended rapidly, almost vertically, until at 8:15 p.m. it was approximately 1/2 mile distant and 1/4 mile above the ground. It then started ascending rapidly, apparently under its own power, and was lost from sight at 8:17 p.m. at an estimated altitude of 20,000 to 30,000 feet, continuing on a northwest course.

During the observation, the witness stated that the object was completely silent and that it appeared to have a glowing reddish-orange color, which at times appeared to be almost white. The witness also stated that the object cast no shadow and that its surface appeared to be smooth and metallic in appearance.

The witness, who is a certified private pilot, stated that the object was definitely not an aircraft and that it did not resemble any type of known or conventional aircraft. He also stated that he is completely convinced that the object was of extraterrestrial origin.
