DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES MAR. 3-9, 1969

The clouds in this publication are a reproduction of the actual clouds shown on the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-mb Map, and the 850-mb Map. All of the charts for one day are featured on a single page in this publication. They are copied from original weather charts prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce.

The Surface Weather Map presents the actual surface weather observations and conditions used previously in Daily Weather Maps. An important change is that in the future, these maps may be published without change to the Existing Surface Weather Map, which will result in a more rapid availability of surface observations. This change is scheduled to be effective April 1, 1969.
