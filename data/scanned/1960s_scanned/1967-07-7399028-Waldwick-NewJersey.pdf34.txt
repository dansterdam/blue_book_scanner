The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. There are several black and white photographic images or samples of some kind displayed on the page, but no specific human faces or identities are visible. 

Transcribing the text from the document:

Dear Mr. Greenarilla,

I attended a sighting of a satellite or U.F.O. recently. Appreciating the information could give me as much free information on this subject, I would thank you what I saw. Please let me know what do you think of the evidence.

Sincerely,

(illegible signature)

P.S. Enclosed are a few samples relating to this U.F.O. sighting.
