Dear Sirs:

I wish to report seeing what I believe was a UFO. It was last Saturday, November 5th, a few minutes before 6 p.m. I had just let my dogs in the house and stepped out in the yard with them. It was dark and the stars were out. I looked up at the sky over Doylestown and saw a lighted moving object. It was just a little larger than the horizontal pictures of the UFO. There was luminescence in the area around the object. It moved slowly across the sky over Doylestown and vanished to the south taking somewhat the route of 202. No airplanes were in the sky at the time. I'd say the object was about the size of a plane and flying at about the same height. These were just estimates on my part. My first reaction was "a lot of people will see that one", as it was so clear-cut. I have just called the "Intelligences" and they have had no other reports. My dogs showed no reaction, and I was observing alone. I live in the country between Forest Grove and Doylestown.
