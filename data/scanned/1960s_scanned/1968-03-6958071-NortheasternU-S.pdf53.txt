Dear Sir:

I am sending you my observations of a UFO that was sighted in many parts of the USA on Sunday Night March 3, 1968.

I hope this information will be helpful in identifying the object or objects.

My observations are as follows:
1) Time of observation - 9:46 pm March 3, 1968
2) Place of observation - Oliver Springs, Tenn. 
3) Direction of observation - Approx. N 45 seconds
4) Approximate duration of observation - Approx. 1:30
5) Nature of UFO - The UFO was first seen as it passed tangent to the lower edge of the near full moon, then appeared to be inclined at a nearly ecliptic angle as illustrated.

As the UFO moved east, it passed in front of the constellation CASSIOPEIA, and disappeared in the NE in the vicinity of Constellation DRACO.
