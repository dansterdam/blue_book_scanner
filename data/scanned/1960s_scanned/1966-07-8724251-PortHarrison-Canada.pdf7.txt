My meeting at Steinhurst, Alaska included the following detailed information :

This incident took place over Port Harrison, Canada, about 1:00 to 1:30 AM on July 8, 1966. The witness, an RCAF airman, observed a large metallic saucer-shaped object with bright light along its outside rim and a bright blue light in the center. The object was silent, and estimated to be about 300 feet in diameter. It hovered for several minutes, then accelerated in a "blink of an eye" to the east at a tremendous speed. The airman reported the incident to his commanding officer immediately. Other airmen on the base also observed the object at the same time.
