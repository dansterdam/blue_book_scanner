On the morning of 8 Nov 1964 I saw a professional photographer who was in the group of the people experienced in meeting. The man I have seen was about 5'8" tall, thin, with reddish brown hair, mid 40s, dressed conservatively (dark suit, white shirt, tie, etc.) and carrying a small camera (probably 35mm). I told him the details of my sighting, but he seemed neither impressed nor surprised. I hope that my signing this report will not be damaging in any way to my future. I would not like to be damaged in the world of science. Sincerely yours,
