The image contains two illustrations. The top illustration is a compass rose diagram with instructions on how to use it to determine the direction of a phenomenon when first seen. The bottom illustration appears to be a sketch depicting a person standing on a road or path with a cloudy/hazy landscape in the background.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and extract all the text from the document:

6A: NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE 
THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "S" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE 
THE DIRECTION WHEN LAST SEEN.

7: IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. SHOW 
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "S" THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER IT 
APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIGZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE.
