Narrative:
Signally pulled into drive of isolated farm house. He noticed a light in the sky 5-35 at 10 or 15 degrees elevation. He gave it no more than a momentary glance and went into the house. As he had forgotten his books so had to return to the car. Re approached the car from the door through which he had entered. It dimmed when he opened the car door and the dome light came on. He brightened when he shut the car door. I pointed out that perhaps the light dimmed when he opened the door and brightened when he shut it, as though the clouding partially covering it that way. He didn't think so, but was not as certain about cloud interference. Now convinced it was no ordinary star, he rushed back into the house where his son-in-law and daughter were to look at the object. Excitedly he called out "You don't get excited, I keep the lights out and you come out to the back kitchen door to watch the thing, but don't go to the bottom of the drive". The son-in-law girl friend Linda was afraid to leave the house for fear of the strange object. The son-in-law said "Linda you are just chicken hearted, this thing is not going to hurt you", but she still would not go out in dread daylight.

Some clouds always around or under the object as it difficult to figure exactly what it was.  To the father the object appeared illuminated (foothill or seg?) bright as a full moon, a fiery reddish orange color or like an arc light picture briefly on the left hand side once. The object seemed to origin from nothing (possible) in clue weather this bright orange in color, so used to pulsate and just sat there in the sky.
