Dear Sir:

We are three boys who have seen something on early Saturday morning, June 27, that we think you might be interested in hearing about. We were sleeping in a field just adjacent to Ravenna Road in Forest Hills, Ohio, when we saw at approximately 4:55 AM a light moving very slowly at a low altitude. As the light approached, we saw that it was a large, saucer-shaped object, silent, and giving off a glow that illuminated the surrounding area. It hovered over us for a few seconds and then moved rapidly away in a northeasterly direction and disappeared from view. We have not told anyone else about this, as we were a little doubtful as to whether you would be interested. However, we felt that you should know about this incident. Please let us know if you would like any additional information.

Sincerely,
