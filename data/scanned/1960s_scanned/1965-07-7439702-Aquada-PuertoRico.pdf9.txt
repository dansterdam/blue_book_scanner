Dear Mr. ---------

This is in reply to your unidentified flying object report.

The object you described on the negatives which you furnished with your report has been carefully examined.

The direction and flight of the object which you observed indicates that it is possible that a helicopter of the U.S. Air Force was operating in the area at the time.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING
