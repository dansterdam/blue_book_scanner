The Directed Flying Object
By Ron Sutton
They've already done their communication saucer-type machines
which are now being built in some companies, and there is now machine that can be
controlled from a distance, but it appears to be a flying saucer of some type. There
have been a number of reports of these things that have been investigated, and so far
no one has been able to identify them. Some people think they're from another planet or
from another dimension. 
A flying object was observed at shooting down an enlarged picture which appeared to
be sort of a saucer-shaped affair. I won't say it definitely was a flying saucer, but at
the same time I can't identify what it was. It was definitely an unidentified flying object.
This occurred at Speeding down, and Lansing Road. The object was moving across the
field in a horizontal direction. It was sharply lighted, and seemed to be metallic. Smoke
was trailing. It flashed on and off. The duration was about 10 seconds.
