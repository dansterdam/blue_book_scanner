The report describes that 5 RF-4C aircraft were airborne 4-10 miles south of the area at the time of the observation. The observers saw two white colored objects that were trailing the RF-4C aircraft. One of the objects stopped in the air, turned sideways, and possibly came to a stop. This second object then made a burst of speed and appeared to rejoin the first object, at which point the observers saw something that looked like a mass of metal coming down from the aircraft.
