There is no photograph present in this document. This appears to be a typed text from a Project Blue Book report.

If, however, we assume that the width of the print corresponds to the width of a 35 mm frame, or 34 mm, then the trails are 22/25h or a frame long, or on a 35 mm negative, 2.95. The focal length of a lens which would produce a 2.95 mm trail in 5 minutes would be 95 mm, if we assume a standard 50 mm lens. The time would be increased to 8.5 minutes. In the first case the image of the moon if not overexposed, on the final print would have a diameter of 3.25 mm, and in the second case 5.75 mm. 

In one interview, Mr. and Mrs. [redacted], Southampton, mentioned seeing the pictures taken by [redacted] on Thursday, October 27; the pictures were clearly neither taken on Sunday night, nor of the UFO. Mrs. [redacted] is Mrs. [redacted] sister-in-law. The interview was taped, and witnessed by Art Setronic of Newday.

The publisher who bought the pictures was given the factual information above, and while no conclusions were suggested by the investigators, it seems certain that these pictures will not be published as UFO pictures.

SUMMARY
Most of the sightings are either positively identified as stars, identical in description to positively identified stars, or identical in description to satellites or aircraft. Of the remaining cases, only two involve a UFO; the [redacted] case involving sighting of an oval object, and the multiple observations of 30 October. Only the 30 October sighting contained enough information to permit stating that an object of unusual nature was in fact present. This case requires further study.

There may well be more reports received from this same series of investigations.
