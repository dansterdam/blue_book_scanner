Now imagine you are at the center of the compass rose. Place an X on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when first seen. Place a 4-on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when last seen.

In the sketch below, place an X at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a 4 at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. Connect the X and 4 with a line to indicate the path of the phenomenon. Refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
