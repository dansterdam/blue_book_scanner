I am a housewife and live in Easthapton in a small village. My husband works and I stay home. This is the first time I have seen anything like this. It was very interesting and I would like to know more about it. It was not like anything I have seen before and I am quite fascinated by it. I do not know how to explain what I saw, but it seemed that there was a light or something in the sky that moved in a flat shaped object.
