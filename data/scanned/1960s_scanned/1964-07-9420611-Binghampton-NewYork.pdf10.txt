Another flying saucer?
Binghamton, New York - Last night's sighting of a flying 
object over Binghamton caused a new wave of UFO interest 
around here. The latest incident was reported by two 
youngsters who claimed they saw a flying saucer in the sky
about 7:15 p.m. last night. The boys, Philip Ross, 15, 
and Antonio Wingler, 14, residents of the Endicott-Johnson 
City area, said the object they saw was round and silvery
in color and that it hovered in the sky for a few seconds, 
then shot off at a terrific speed. Airport officials said
they had no reports of any unidentified craft in the area 
last night. So what did the boys see?

Flying what?
...What strange phenomena is observed in the sky above? 
Where did it originate? Did it actually leave the earth 
and return again? The answer is not known for certain 
but reports of "flying saucers" and other UFO's continue
to come in with alarming regularity...
