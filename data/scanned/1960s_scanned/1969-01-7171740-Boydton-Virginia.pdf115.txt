The Surface Weather Map presents the station data and the analysis of the 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by heavy dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.
The highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.
The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation.
