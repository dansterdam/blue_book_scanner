Sir:

First, let me say that I am not writing this because of all the sightings of UFO's that have been reported but only because I feel this is a matter that I would like to state just what I saw--without any doubts whatever.

On September 8, 1965, I was doing some repair work on my car here in Sauk Centre, Minnesota. About 8:30 p.m., I went out to get a part from the hardware store. As I went back into my garage, I noticed a strange object hovering in the sky over the Sauk Centre water tower. I called to my son and he also saw the object. It was round, and had a blue glow around it. It seemed to be about 500 feet from the ground. The size I would estimate to be about 75 to 100 feet in diameter. It made no sound and it just hovered there for about two minutes and then suddenly shot straight up very high out of sight. It made no noise and it disappeared immediately. The other man who saw it with me was a neighbor who came out to see what I was looking at. He was just as amazed as I was. This is exactly what I saw. I have good glasses and my eyes are excellent for at my age (65). I would appreciate hearing from anyone who can explain this. If there were any plans in the area and in trouble we should know about it.

Very truly yours,
