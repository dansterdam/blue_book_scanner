35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire explanation of your sighting:
At approx. 8:15 P.M, March 8, 1966, while driving south on FM 1464 near Houston, Texas, my wife and I observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be of a disc shape. The light was moving erratically and at a high rate of speed, making sharp turns and stops. It was approximately 500 yards from our position and appeared to be at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. The light could not be identified as any known aircraft and no sound was heard. The light was observed for approx. 2-3 minutes before it disappeared. I am a former Air Force aircraft maintenance officer and am familiar with most aircraft. This sighting does not fit any known conventional aircraft. I would appreciate any information your office may have on this incident.
