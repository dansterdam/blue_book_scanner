At 0309 hours the initial report was received from a maintenance team director whom suspected a fire at the ammo storage area. An AIC Officer came this base tic to investigate. They further stated that it was reddish orange in color, a very strange light, oblong shape slowly rotating and white lightning within the object but no engine noise. At 0315 the object moved South at a high rate of speed and left the area. Ext Pond the FCO at Nov Pike stated that the object which looked to his set this time was the same one that has moved about one mile away with the two CAB following. They came within 1/2 mile of the object but could not determine what it was. Ext Smith of Canon-1 saw the object accelerate in two directions and pass under some clouds. The entire observation period was 15 minutes. The entire conservation period as near as can be determined was about 15 minutes.
