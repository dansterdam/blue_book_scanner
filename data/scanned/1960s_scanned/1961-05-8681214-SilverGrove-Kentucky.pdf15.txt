SILVER GROVE, KENTUCKY
On May 8, 1961, at approximately 8:15 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, an unidentified flying object was observed by Mr. Richard L. Harvey of Silver Grove, Kentucky.

Mr. Harvey stated that while standing on the porch of his home, he observed a bright light approaching from the northwest, moving at a very high rate of speed. The object appeared to be elongated in shape and had a bright reddish-orange glow about it. The object was on a horizontal course, traveling from west to east. The object suddenly changed direction, moving to the southwest at a very high rate of speed, and disappeared from view.

Mr. Harvey stated that the object was in view for approximately 30 seconds. He further stated that the object made no sound and left no visible trail. This incident was reported to the United States Air Force and investigated by Project Blue Book, the official U.S. Government program for the investigation of unidentified flying objects.
