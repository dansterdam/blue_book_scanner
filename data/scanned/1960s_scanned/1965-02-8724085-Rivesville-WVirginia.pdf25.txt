Between Alaska & Japan 
Mid-February, 1962
Three enormous flying discs, computed to be about 1,000 feet in diameter, passed a U.S. airliner on mid-February, between Alaska and Japan. Details of the encounter, as reported by the airline pilot, are as follows:
The airliner was on a routine flight from Anchorage, Alaska, to Tachibana, Japan. Four hours out of Anchorage, the airliner's co-pilot spotted three enormous circular objects, each estimated to be about 1,000 feet in diameter. The objects were directly in the path of the airliner, traveling at an estimated speed of 1,900 mph. As the airliner approached the discs, the co-pilot alerted the captain, who confirmed the sighting. The captain stated that as the airliner drew close, the three discs accelerated and shot away at an incredible speed, disappearing from sight within seconds.
In connection with the Flying Tiger case, it is interesting to note that this is the third major airline incident involving UFOs that has been reported in the last few years. See pages 2 and 3 for detailed story.
