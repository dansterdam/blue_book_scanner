The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a "Sighting of Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire" form with various questions about the UFO sighting, including the date, time, location, and visual observations. The form also includes a sketch area for the observer to draw the path and shape of the observed phenomenon.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text from the document as an OCR system:
