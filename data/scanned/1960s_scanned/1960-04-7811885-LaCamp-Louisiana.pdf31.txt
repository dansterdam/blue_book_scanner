DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
STAFF MESSAGE FORM  
IN COMING

17 APR 1952

PAGE FIVE REFERRED 2A
A TERRIFYING RATE OF SPEED. IT IS MY OPINION THAT SOME TYPE OF
OBJECT HIT THE GROUND AND THEN RICOCHETTED OFF ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A WING-TIP COULD HAVE MADE THE IMPRESSIONS 
ON THE GROUND, BUT THEY WERE VERY IRREGULAR. THERE WAS
NO SIGN OF ANY TYPE EQUIPMENT IN THE AREA AT THE
TIME OF THE INVESTIGATION. MY FATHER, WHO LIVES ABOUT 300 YARDS
FROM WHERE IT HAPPENED, WHO LIVES APPROXIMATELY 200 YARDS FROM THE SOURCE,
SAID THAT WHAT MUST OF A GET BLACKED OUT FOR ABOUT FIVE (5) SECONDS
AFTER IT PASSED OVER. APPROXIMATELY 150 YARDS FROM THE SOURCE
A HIGH WHINE FOLLOWED BY ABOUT TEN (10) FAST EXPLOSIONS.
SOUNDED LIKE ARTILLERY SHELLS, SINCE THESE
TWO MEN LIVE ON THE BORDER OF FORT POLK RESERVATION, THEY HAVE
MUCH EXPERIENCE IN ARTILLERY SOUNDS, HOWEVER, FORT POLK
DENIES ANY ARTILLERY FIRE IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED. SO
MONROE ARNOLD HAS LITTLE FORMAL EDUCATION BUT IS A KEEN OBSERVER
WITH A PASSION FOR ACCURACY. HIS STORY IS COMMON WITH COUNTRY FOLKS
OF THIS SECTION. HE HAS HAD JATO BOTTLES FALL ON HIS FARM
BEFORE WITHOUT CAUSING UNDUE EXCITEMENT. HE SEEMS TO COMMAND
SUCH RESPECT AMONG HIS NEIGHBORS. ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE GENERAL
AREA SEEM UPSET FROM THE EXPLOSIONS, IF
THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN BE OF FURTHER ASSISTANCE, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.
