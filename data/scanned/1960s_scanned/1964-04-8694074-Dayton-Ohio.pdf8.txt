About 7:15 p.m. on March 24, 1964, I observed a bright light in the sky over Dayton, Ohio. The object appeared to be oval in shape and seemed to change color from white to green. It made no sound and remained in the sky for approximately 45 minutes before disappearing. I could not determine the distance or altitude of the object, but it was clearly visible in the evening sky.
