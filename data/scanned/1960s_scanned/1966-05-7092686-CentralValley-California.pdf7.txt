The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing an observation of a UFO-like object. The text in the document is as follows:

May whom it may concern,

On the after noon of May 17,1966 between 11:50 + 12:00 A.M. I glanced out the window and I saw a object that looked like a spool of thread. It was over a field about 500 or more yards away. I don't know how high it was. Just that it looked like it was over a woods. It looked like it was made of some shiny metal. It could be some kind of material that was in the shape at first I thought I thought it was over the trees, but as I watched it, it just hovered, until it disappeared. That night I was watching the 6:00 news and they had people on tv that saw UFO's that say they never though of sending it in, because I never thought of sending it in before.
