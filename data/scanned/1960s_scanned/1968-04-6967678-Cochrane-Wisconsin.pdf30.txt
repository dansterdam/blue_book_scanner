Reference:	Your letter of 14 February 

To:	Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla

1. I enclose evaluation cards for all four cases requested. I regret that some of these cases are being sent to you unduly late. Reorganization of my office files should prevent this in the future.

2. I regret also, from your standpoint, that all four cases must in my opinion be evaluated as unidentified.  

3. I would rate the one case from July 1968, Omaha, Nebraska, case as the weakest in this category and the one at Cochrane, Wisconsin, the strongest. I obtained a good summary of the Cochrane case, and will send you a copy of the transcription as soon as my secretary can accomplish this.

There is some additional data which I obtained on the Omaha July 1968 case, because I needed to close up some portions of the investigation. This will be sent to you after I obtain an additional transcript which I requested.

Sincerely,

J. Allen Hynek, Director
