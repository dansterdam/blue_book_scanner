Dear Mr. [Redacted],

Although we have received reports from other observers of this object which you describe, we have had no official literature concerning it from the Unidentified Flyirig Objects information reports. As a matter of policy, all such "unidentified objects" are considered as just that - "unidentified." Since no positive identification can be made through the information available, and since the object you describe is within the general pattern of such "unidentified objects," no further investigation is contemplated at this time. We appreciate your interest in this matter and thank you for bringing it to our attention.

Yours very truly,

Frank E. Strawman, Jr.
Chief, Project Blue Book
