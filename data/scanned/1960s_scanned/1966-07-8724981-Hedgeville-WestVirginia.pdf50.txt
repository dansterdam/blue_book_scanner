Dear Sir,

On Sunday July 31st '66 at 1:20 a.m. at a point in Northern Ontario ( latitude 46 0 or; longitude 80 0 ??) an object was observed at approximately satellite speed (15 miles per minute) to north at an altitude of approximately 30 0 was traversed in approximately 5 minutes. The object was observed to be cylindrical in shape (or conical), brownish in color, and sub-sequentially change course to a heading approximately due east. 
Its luminosity appeared to slow down and subsequently change course to an easterly direction. The object was under observation for about one minute.
Because of the attitude or smallness of the object, no details were observed of its structure or shape. The observation was exceptionally clear, that evening and a number of stars were visible. 
The object was not obscured by clouds and it was moving at very high speed.
