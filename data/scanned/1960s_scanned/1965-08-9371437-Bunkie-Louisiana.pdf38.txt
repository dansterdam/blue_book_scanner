November 30, 1965

Mrs. _______
Omaha, Nebraska 

Dear Mrs. _______:

Following our phone conversation, I am sending you several copies of the Form 106s, one for you and the others for your neighbors. I hope they will cooperate and kindly fill these out.

Please refer only to the object sighted originally and not to the satellite or other things seen in the week or week and a half later.

The jilled-out forms should be mailed back to me.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
