"Thank you for reporting your sighting of an unidentified object (UFO) to the Air Force.

Without additional information, however, we cannot offer an explanation of what you observed. But if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it to the enclosed envelope, we shall be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever start another UFO, please report it at once, either by telephone or telegram, as these fresh sightings are of the utmost importance in our on-the-spot investigations, which usually results in a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.
