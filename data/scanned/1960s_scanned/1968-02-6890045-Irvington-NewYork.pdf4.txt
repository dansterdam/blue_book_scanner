MAR 8 1968

Dear [redacted],

This will reply to your letter of February 26, 1968, in which you described an unidentified flying object (UFO) that you and your father observed.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the UFO you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it to the address on the enclosed envelope, our records may provide clues that will be useful in investigating your case further and making an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. SWILLLS
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
