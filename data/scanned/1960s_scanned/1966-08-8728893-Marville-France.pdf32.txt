"Greetings 
from
Montana...

Montana, a state which takes enormous pride in its traditions of the past, also looks to the future with continuing expansion and progress. With its rugged mountains, raging rivers, placid lakes and vast open spaces it offers unlimited opportunities to the outdoorsman; deer, antelope and elk in abundance, coupled with hundreds of crystal-clear streams and lakes teeming with fighting trout and Montana hopes to their liking.

For those who seek the finer things in life, Montana is a veritable paradise. Modern, progressive cities like Billings, Great Falls, Butte, Missoula and Bozeman offer the finest in shopping, entertainment, and cultural advantages, yet are closely linked to the great open spaces which draw tourists from all over the world.

We welcome inquiries regarding Montana as a prospective resident for our progressive state, as well as any questions you may have. We shall be most happy and willing to answer them.

Sincerely yours, 

Tim Babcock, Governor"
