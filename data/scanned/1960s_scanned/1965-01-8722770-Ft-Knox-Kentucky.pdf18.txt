"Report of a Collision of a Bright Light
One man said he was going to work at 5:30 AM 
about 8 miles from Fort Knox, Kentucky, when he saw a
bright light in the sky. At first he thought it was a star,
until it seemed to come closer and closer. Then it appeared
to be hovering about 100 feet off the ground. At one point 
it came very near the car and then seemed to go back up
into the sky. He said the light was so bright he could not
look at it directly. After it went up it seemed to disappear.
No more sightings were reported in the area."
