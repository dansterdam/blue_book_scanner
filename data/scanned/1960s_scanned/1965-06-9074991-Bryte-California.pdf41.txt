We of the newly formed organization titled Mental Investigations Organization (M.I.O.) request that you be interested in our purpose to inform all of new data that is in our possession, which is:

1) The propulsion mechanics of the U.F.O.'s:
2) The control and power inside the U.F.O. visits to the earth.
3) The reason for the lack of direct physical contact between these visitators and the earth.

This information has made believers of many who were previously skeptical. The method of the propulsion her been carefully closed is a small diagram that will be of reference value when gravitational forces are available.

M.I.O. does not and will not release any data that cannot be proven by scientific fact and that they cooperate in establishing proof of our association.

The enclosed affidavit from a teacher at an educational institution supports their purpose. We hope that we are able to present in some manner this information without the appearance of our organization. While we are working this case please drop.
