The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document describing a UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

Then when I looked at it again it was not to disappear so i knew it was moving out of it did not appear to be. Next, it landed on the ground about 3 feet east of where I was standing in the window of my home. It was a large round, silvery, pulsating light with something dark inside. I had camera but did not get anyone who might be operating it. Then, at 6:30 a.m. it raised and flew across the street and landed on the lawn of the home where I was first a minute, when it went up in the air again about the trees and flew towards the city, Muncie, Indiana.
