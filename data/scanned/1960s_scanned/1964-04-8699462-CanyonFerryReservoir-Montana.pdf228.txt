FARMER CLAIMS' CONTACT

Newark Valley, New York, April 24 - As if similar sightings were not sufficient, word has reached us of a most interesting "little green men" contacts, alleged to have been experienced by a young farmer in upstate New York.

Gary T. Wilcox, the supposed eyewitness, reports that shortly before dawn on the morning of April 17, he was awakened by a strange light in his bedroom. On further investigation, he observed a shiny object descending upon his farm, just south of his residence. As it touched down, the object - described as being similar in appearance to a military refrigerator - issued a beam of light, which scanned the area adjacent to the object, and then disappeared. He soon noticed two small humanoid figures, approximately 3 feet in height, suddenly appeared. They were dressed in what seemed to be a strange, one-piece, turtle-neck-like affair, whose color Wilcox described as resembling weathered aluminum. According to Wilcox, these strange creatures then began operating a very unusual piece of equipment, which he described as "odd-shaped" and resembling "breathing apparatus".
