Memo for the record
Sighting of 27 Jan 68
Tele phone conversation of 1 Feb 68
Mr. [ REDACTED ] have gotten photos of the obj. At first Mr. [ REDACTED ] thought the photos were the result of static electricity. However because of the coincidence that the plates are for the correct time period; that static usually occurs on more than just two plates and that there was a bright object sighted by two of the guards, he is no longer sure that the plates are of static. The biggest reason that Mr. [ REDACTED ] thought the plates were of static is that the two pairs of plates should overlay if the photos are of meteor or of a satellite re-entry. Mr. [ REDACTED ] said that he would give us a written statement of the occurrence if we requested it. He also said he would give the two guards, [ REDACTED ] and [ REDACTED ], // if we sent them to him.
The photos have been forwarded to Dr. Mcgroarty at the Smithsonian but Dr. [ REDACTED ] will have copies sent to us.
