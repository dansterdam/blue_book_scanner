Report of UFO Activity, May-June, 1954
Dearborn, Michigan
DETAILS:
On June 11-14, 1954, this correspondent and R. E. David Mood, USAF, visited Lansing, Michigan, to investigate various reports of UFO activity and USAF-related phenomena which were received by local and state police during the period starting on the night of 20 May, 1954 and ending 15 June, the last night of the investigation.

The Sites: At 0300 EST, 21 May 1954, the Lansing police department began to receive a series of calls concerning the sighting of various objects, which were designated as "weird" and "loud," and indicated that it was like nothing they had ever heard before. The calmes are linked in the police log as coming to the realization which was found, and according to the correspondence files, they are omitted (more than a dozen names are recorded, and police say that after this many had called, they stopped logging further calls, as police were not equipped to handle such a volume).

The Ingham County Sheriff's Police department reports that at 0300 on the date of the reports, a police car was on an emergency run along Miller Road (5-W) and observed a fiery red object approximately the size of a large automobile going and departing rapidly. This new area employs a very loud time voice and falls both in pitch and intensity at a rapid rate - two to three times per second. The resulting pattern is quite uncertain and appears to consist of such things as child, and the conviction on the part of the callers that something remarkable was occurring. One woman, a ... reported a ship-shaped "traveling at incredible speed" over trees, which was illuminated and appeared to have a gray metallic surface.
