LANDING IN BRAZIL: On 10 September 1965 an incident, on territory, but in which no landing (sic) taking place, was reported. A farmer, who was working in the fields, observed a bright object land at a distance of approximately 200 meters from his position. The object was about 15 meters in diameter, bell-shaped, and while landing and talking among themselves, the occupants were observed through field glasses. After a short time, the object took off, ascending vertically, and disappeared over the horizon. In the area where the object landed, burns in the vegetation were found, as well as impressions on the ground.
There being no other evidence to corroborate the incident, the case is being treated as a possible landing by unidentified flying objects, but their occupants could not be identified.
