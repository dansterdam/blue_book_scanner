There does not appear to be any photograph or image included in this page from the Project Blue Book report. The page consists entirely of text, which I will now transcribe:

20. Draw a picture that will show the reason that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
Airplane or vehicle type object flew quickly overhead.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
Cannot give a precise estimate. Object was sighted briefly.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, object disappeared from view quickly.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
Airplane.
