This report covers a sighting that occurred near Brookesville, Florida on March 6, 1965. The witness, a retired 73 year old man, reported observing a strange elliptical shaped object in the sky near his home at approximately 7:30 p.m. on the evening of March 6th. 

According to the witness, the object appeared to be hovering silently approximately 200 yards above the tree line, emitting a bright fluorescent glow. The witness stated that the object was approximately 50 feet in diameter and had a distinct oval shape. He further reported that the object remained stationary for several minutes before suddenly accelerating at a high rate of speed and disappearing from view.

The witness, who had been outside taking an evening walk, immediately reported the sighting to the local sheriff's department. An investigation was subsequently conducted, but no additional evidence or corroborating witnesses were identified.

This case has been classified as unresolved due to the lack of physical evidence or additional witness testimony to substantiate the reported observations.
