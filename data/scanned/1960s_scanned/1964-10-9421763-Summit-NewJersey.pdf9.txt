Major Easton M. Jacks, 
Director of Information,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Major Jacks:

In May of 1964 I inquired about the sighting of an unidentified flying object at Socorro, New Mexico (May, 1964). Just out of curiosity, I 
was told that this incident was observed by a local law enforcement officer.

At that time I was sent a briefing of the investigation. That was listed as unidentified and still being investigated. What was the final 
explanation given by officials from Wright-Patterson Field?

Trusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience.

Very truly yours,
