Dear Miss Coull:

Reference is made to your recent unidentified sighting of 5 August 1969. 
The information which we have received is not sufficient for evaluation. Requests for additional data on the observed UFOs from 1961 are being forwarded to the field for follow-up action.

The Air Force appreciates your interest in this subject.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book"
