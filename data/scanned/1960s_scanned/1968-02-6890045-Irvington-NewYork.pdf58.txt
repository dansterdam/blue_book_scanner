There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, which contains text describing a Razoox Automatic Solar Optical Telescope system.

The text in the document reads as follows:

RAZOOX AUTOMATIC SOLAR OPTICAL TELESCOPE 

The solar patrol telescope employed is a versatile automatic tracking system for monochromatic studies of flares and related phenomena. The telescope is precision engineered and designed for precise guiding and photometry and measurements in addition to solar patrol work. This system is controlled automatically by servo mechanisms from a remote control console. Scanning or daily automated systemic records and prominence photography are obtained.

FEATURES: 120- to 220-mm, optical aperture to 0.5 second of arc simultaneous observation. Continous data recording cameras and synoptic film follower with 0.2-second frame interval. Heli-heliostat filter and controls for 1:1 size H-alpha and K-line double bandpass filters. Accessory equipment: 16mm camera, aerial lens, image intensifies, recorder, and white-light telescope, halographic projection system.
