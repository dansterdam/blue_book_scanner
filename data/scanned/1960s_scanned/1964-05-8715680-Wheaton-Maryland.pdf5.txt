The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a newspaper article from "The Journal-Gaz" in Fort Wayne, Indiana, dated Friday, May 22, 1964. The article is titled "Unidentified Sky Objects Seen Here Last Night" and describes sightings of unidentified flying objects in the local area the previous night.

The text of the article reads:

UNIDENTIFIED! 
Sky Objects Seen Here
Last Night

UFO's again.
The Oberreich Field Tower last night reported seeing four unidentified flying objects moving over the city. Several residents also called to report the sighings, said they flashed rhythmically and moved at a high rate of speed before disappearing, unsuccessful.
It was a fascinating sight, they said.
