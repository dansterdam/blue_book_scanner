The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, containing a memo routing slip. The slip has a header that says "MEMO ROUTING SLIP" and the text field contains details about a "Bunker Hill WX" sighting, including the date, time, location, and a note that the sighting was "NEGATIVE". There is no photograph present on this page.
