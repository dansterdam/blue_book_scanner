Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 29 February 1960 regarding the sighting of an unidentified flying object seen by you and your wife on the evening of 12 February in Tucson, Arizona.

Your letter contains insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, I must ask you to furnish your wife's completed questionnaire as soon as possible. The information requested therein is essential for this office's technical intelligence evaluation.

Sincerely,
