The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a typed letter. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

Dear Mr. Hall:

Unfortunately, I am not able at this time to send you the photographs. Unfortunateley, I can not at this time give you any copies of the photographs, because I only have the negatives here. The photography classes are using these negatives, and I will not be able to send them until the classes are over.

I trust that you understand the position I am in. I will have the negatives copied as soon as possible, and will send them to you. Some of the groups have requested copies, and I have had to refuse them also. As you can understand, it is necessary for me to be careful, and to accede to the requests only of those who have a scientific interest in the matter.

Thank you for your interest. I am hoping to have the photographs copied, and will send them to you as soon as possible.

Sincerely yours,

Leon Hall
Associate Director
Griffith Observatory and Planetarium
