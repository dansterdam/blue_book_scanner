INVESTIGATION REPORT  

A. INVESTIGATION OF THE SIGHTING LOCATION:

No physical evidence was found at the sight. The area was searched thoroughly but no signs of disturbance or anything abnormal were discovered.

B. INTERVIEWS WITH WITNESSES:

1. MR. JOHN DOE reported seeing a bright object in the sky at approximately 7:00 PM, which was larger than a star and pulsating in brightness. The object was observed for a short period of time before disappearing behind some trees.

2. MRS. JANE DOE, wife of Mr. Doe, also observed the bright object in the sky at the same time as her husband. She described it as being larger than a star, shining brightly, and pulsating in brightness before disappearing.

C. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS:

Based on the witness testimony, the object observed was likely a bright planet or star, possibly Venus, that was affected by atmospheric conditions causing it to appear pulsating in brightness. No further investigation is warranted as there is no evidence to suggest the presence of any unidentified aerial phenomena.
