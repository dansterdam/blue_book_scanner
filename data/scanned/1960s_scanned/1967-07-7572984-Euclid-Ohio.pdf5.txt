SUBJECT: Radio Air Force, EUCLID OHIO
Date: 7 July 1967
Dear Major:
On last night, 6 July 1967, at approximately 2225 hrs. I received a telephone call from an individual (name not given) who claimed that he had just observed some unusual aerial activity in the Euclid, Ohio, area. The caller stated that he and some friends had been fishing on the shore of Lake Erie, Euclid, Ohio, when they observed what appeared to be two or three bright objects in the sky. The caller described these objects as being "larger than aircraft" and that they were "moving rapidly, up and down and sideways at high speed." He also stated that the objects appeared to be giving off "brilliant flashes of light." 
The caller was very excited and asked that I notify the Air Force or other proper authorities of what he and his friends had observed. I immediately notified the Command Post, Sixth Air Force, at Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, of this UFO report. The Command Post stated that they would pass the information to the appropriate agency.
Sunday and the incidents. I did not see the objects and found no boat in trouble and the men reported seeing something like "explorers life raft" but found no boat, and they were not like regular aircraft. I talked to the Coast Guard. She said they had no report. I am sorry I did not see the objects as I was not out at the time I had called on.
