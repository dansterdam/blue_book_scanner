Dear Major Quintanilla:

I am writing in reply to your letters of May 6th and May 7th. In checking the USAF Pilot report files I find no report for August 28th 1967 between the hours of 2300Z and 2330Z.

There is likewise no report for October 6th, 1967 anywhere near the Northeast area of the U.S.A.

A continuous check of the March files still show no report for March 24th, 1968 between the hours of 0132Z to 0142Z.

I am very sorry that I have been unable to help you with any of the above requests. Please be sure to write if there is anything further that I might be able to help you with.

Sincerely Yours,

// H. P. Bolch, Project Director
