DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON. INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT WAS SOLID OR TRANSPARENT, WHETHER IT BROKE UP OR EXPLODED, DESCRIBE THE SHAPE OR INDICATE IF IT APPEARED FUZZY OR SHARP. INDICATE COMPARISONS WITH FAMILIAR OBJECTS, LIKE STAR, A LIGHT, OR AIRCRAFT:

A light in the sky, glowing in a dark blue or black color, was observed. It was observed for a period of time, and the light grew brighter and dimmer during the observation, as if pulsing. The light appeared similar to an evening star or planet, but its brightness varied more than is typical for a celestial object.
