I would like to request some information on some strange objects the saw in the sky. Most north on April 23rd about 9:00 p.m. 

Ii can explain them only as large sized formations attended lay a formation of white lights - a formation of what seemed to be vehicles of some kind.

They seemed to be up and much larger than aircraft. They were no noise and they were traveling at a very fast speed.

I would say we saw them around twenty of them and they were frequently traveling.
