The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document that appears to be a form or report from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

GIVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE: 
DESCRIBE THE PHENOMENON:
Seemed to float and run away.
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY! 
BREAK UP AND EXPAND:
STAND OFF SOME DISTANCE:
CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS? 
STATE BRIGHTNESS: Brilliant
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR:
MAKE A NOISE?
FLIGHT OR BOBBLE:
A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

The phenomenon moved across in front of something, like a cloud, tree, or building, at any time.
