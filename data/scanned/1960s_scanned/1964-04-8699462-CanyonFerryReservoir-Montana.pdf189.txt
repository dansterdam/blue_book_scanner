MEDICINE

Tiny G Suits Advised For Premature Infants

MINIATURIZED SPACE SUITS have been seriously suggested as garments for premature infants. The suits are designed to improve blood circulation and bring benefits for the newborn from this country's advanced space program-results reported by Dr. Mary Allen Engle of Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, in studies of the effects of pressure in which body fluids are displaced.

In addition to the American Medical Association's ex-president, Dr. Louis H. Bauer, chief scientist, reports Medicine Today, two outstanding scientists--Dr. John P. Greenhill, obstetrician, and Dr. Murdock Head, physiologist, of the University of California, have enthusiastically endorsed the development of miniaturized "g suits" for premature babies.
