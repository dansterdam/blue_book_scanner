1. ABOUT 9:15 PM, WHILE GOING BY THE ROAD, I BECAME AWARE OF A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY, APPROXIMATELY 30-40 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. IT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND ABOUT 3-4 TIMES THE SIZE OF A NORMAL STAR, AND WAS TRAVELING AT ABOUT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE, MOVING VERY RAPIDLY IN A SOUTH TO NORTH DIRECTION. THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

2. LAST CALL TO LOOK UP SHOW THAT A SIMILAR OBJECT SEEN AT 8:45 PM IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA, MOVING WITH A VERY RAPID ANGULAR VELOCITY IN A NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST DIRECTION. THIS HAPPENED SOME 15-20 MINUTES PRIOR TO MY SIGHTING. I REALIZE THAT WHAT I SAW WAS NOT A NORMAL AIR CRAFT, AND IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A METEOR, NOR A SATELLITE, SINCE IT WAS MOVING MUCH TOO RAPIDLY AND ITS ANGULAR VELOCITY WAS FAR TOO GREAT. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INFORMATION YOU MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ON THIS MATTER.
