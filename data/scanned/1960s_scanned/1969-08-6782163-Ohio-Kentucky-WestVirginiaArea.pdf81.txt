The image contains two diagrams related to a UFO sighting report.

The large central diagram appears to be a compass or direction indicator, with labels for the cardinal directions and intermediate points. The text below this diagram indicates that it is used to record the position of the observed object relative to the observer.

The two smaller diagrams below appear to be sketches or illustrations related to the UFO sighting. The left-hand diagram shows a landscape view of the observed object, while the right-hand diagram shows a more distant, expansive view of the landscape with the object in the distance.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

APR 80-17(CC)
DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT WHEN FIRST SEEN, PLACE A 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE THOMPSON WHEN LAST SEEN.

NW NW  NE
W        E
SW       SE
S

POSITION OF THE OBJECT WHEN FIRST SEEN. WHEN LAST SEEN, THE POSITION OF THE OBJECT WAS IN A STRAIGHT
LINE TO A POINT APPROXIMATELY 25 TO 30 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING
ERRATICALLY AND ACCELERATING VERY RAPIDLY UNTIL IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT. THE SKETCH IS TO SCALE AND REPRESENTS
THE LARGER SKETCH.
