The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing some event or sighting. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

She did not notice any sound or see it move. Other than that, there is nothing unusual to report except that these strange lights seem to be appearing more frequently in this area.
