All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as those previously used on Daily Weather Map.
