Observation of Unidentified Flying Object

On September 6, 1960, at approximately 9:00 PM, I observed a bright orange-reddish object in the sky southeast of Hartford, Conn. The object appeared to be circular in shape and estimated to be about 30-40 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately five to ten minutes before disappearing over the horizon.

The object appeared to be stationary at first, then began to move in a straight horizontal line at a moderate speed. It then suddenly stopped and hovered for a short period of time before speeding away and disappearing over the horizon. No sound was heard during the observation.

The sky was clear at the time of the observation with only a few scattered clouds. The object seemed to be at an estimated altitude of 3000-5000 feet.
