Mrs. Hall from Base OPS, Mather AFB, ext 2141
will call regarding the observation of 30 Apr 66.
The only thing as far as reports go was -
They had a call on the 30th of Apr but it was not
regarded as a UFO - nothing more on this.
Mrs. Hall is going to check it out and see if she
can find out anything/hand of activity in the area that
might match the sightings. The fire department
also.
