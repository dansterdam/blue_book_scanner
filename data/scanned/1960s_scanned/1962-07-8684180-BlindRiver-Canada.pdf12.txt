The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram or sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The diagram shows a series of circular shapes with lines or trails behind them, indicating that the object was moving. Based on the instructions in the question, I will now proceed to transcribe the text found in the document.

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Sound Whistling, humming
b. Color Characteristic or metallic appearance, bluish-white, slight reddishorange at times

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were:

b. Like a bright star 
c. Sharply outlined
d. Don't remember

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
