Leitha - 8

I tried and I tried, and as long as that thing was above us I just couldn't get that car to go. It just didn't even want to - it just nothing. It wouldn't even turn over, just grunt a little bit and that was it. And then when it was above the other car it stood still and it seemed like everything was so still at that time, and then it moved off.

H How long did this last? How many seconds?

L At the time I was shocked, I couldn't believe it, that it wasn't some- thing like that and I didn't know what it was going to do. Oh, maybe a minute seems so long then, you know, maybe it was - at the most maybe four minutes. 

H I'll tell you what. Let me try a little experiment here. When I say go pretend the thing has just stopped over your car and the engine has stopped, and then just, even if we are silent for a while here, just relive that, image it's happening, and you don't have to say anything, and then when it goes away, say OK.

L Yes, OK. 

H Alright, go.

L About now.

H It was exactly 61 seconds. So, but when things like this are happening, time seems much longer, so don't worry about that. Alright, then, I wanted to ask if your starter worked when the thing was overhead and the engine wasn't going, did the starter try to turn over or what.

L At this time I was trying to start it see, and it might a little bit longer, because I asked Mark I just wonder what that thing is doing.
