DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES MAR. 31-APR. 6, 1969

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the publication called "Daily Weather Maps" which includes the daily weather maps for the 500-millibar chart, air temperature, and lowest temperature forecast/free-air climate. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page, so that a days weather sequence can be readily observed. They are copied from our master collection, which includes the Daily Weather Maps, and distributed as fast as they are available for distribution.

The surface weather maps present, shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degree Celsius. The surface isobars, or lines of equal pressure, are shown in solid lines, with values labeled in millibars. The shading shows the warm and cold-temperature areas, based on the 850-millibar temperatures.

The 500-millibar charts present the contours of the 500-millibar surface at 60-meter intervals. The shaded areas on the 500-millibar charts indicate the areas where the 500-millibar heights are below 5,400 meters, which are usually regions of cloudiness and precipitation.

The height contour values are labeled in meters, and the short lines that intersect the contours indicate the wind direction. The values of the wind speed in knots are given at various points on the 500-millibar charts.

The temperature forecasts for the 24-hour period ending at 0300Z on the date shown are outlined by continuous line. The shaded areas indicate where precipitation is likely.
