8. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS 	Observer reported seeing two lights which appeared to his left then disappeared and reappeared again on his left. Continued in this manner several times, on a definite periodic interval. One light was anchored and the other light moved relative to it. Observer states that since the lights had appeared several times before he realized that they were actually ships rather than aircraft, he got the idea that the observer was actually poking fun at other people who had seen these lights in the area rather than making a report.
