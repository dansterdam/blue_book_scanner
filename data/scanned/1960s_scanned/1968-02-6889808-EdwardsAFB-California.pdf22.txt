There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

I AM AN AIR FORCE TRAINED SURFACE LOCATION OBSERVER AND HAVE BEEN OBSERVING SATTELITES FOR OVER 2 YEARS. I WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR 3 MINUTES. IT APPEARED TO BE A SMALL BLUISH WHITE LIGHT WHICH RAPIDLY CHANGED DIRECTION AND SPEED SEVERAL TIMES. THIS SORT OF OCCURRENCE IS NOT UNUSUAL AND HAS BEEN OBSERVED BY MANY OTHERS.

WHEN AND TO WHOM DID YOU REPORT THAT YOU HAD SIGHTED THIS PHENOMENON?
