Deputy Sheriffs ridiculed
On three occasions in March, high-ranking UFO officers observed and tried to report unusual objects in the sky, but were ridiculed by Napa County deputies William Bishop, John Robertson, James Stubbe, and Stubbe's son.
The UFO's observed on March 14, 15, and 15, were made by Bishop and Robertsontold them the object changed from a dark object to a dim light, and then disappeared. 
Police officers who saw the object chanced from a dim light to a dark object and felt the UFO displayed the capability of hovering, sudden stops, and departures at high speed. The deputies derided the observers, saying "The UFO was a Navy observation balloon with batteries to make it glow."
The account says that the witnesses could clearly see that the object was not a balloon, and dismissed the deputy's explanation. Free balloons drift with the wind, and the witnesses said the object they observed showed directed flight and maneuvers not characteristic of a balloon.
No wonder that disbelief in the official "answers" is steadily growing.
