DURING THE EVENING OF OCTOBER 12, 1950, AN OBSERVATION AT GREYBULL CAUSED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION NEAR GREYBULL, WYOMING. AT 6:16 P.M. MINUTES AFTER SUNSET, RESIDENTS REPORTED A MYSTERIOUS EXPLOSION. THE REVEREND AND MRS. VAN BUSKIRK OBSERVED A BRIGHT, CIGAR-SHAPED OBJECT WHILE LOOKING THROUGH THE RECTORY WINDOW AT A RAINBOW IN THE EAST. THE OBJECT TRAVELLED VERY RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SKY FROM EAST TO WEST, IN A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION. IT CAME TO A STOP NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE SKY. THE WITNESSES SAID THE OBJECT WAS ALUMINUM COLORED AND SHAPED MUCH LIKE A FOOTBALL. THE OBJECT HOVERED FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN DISAPPEARED ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE OBJECT. AND AT THE BOW END A ROD WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A PROPELLER WAS OBSERVED. 
SOME INDIVIDUALS AT THE GROUND SEEMED TOTALLY PUZZLED BY THE INCIDENT, AND SOME SOUND WAS HEARD ABOVE IT. THE SPEED OF THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED BY THE REVEREND TO BE VERY RAPID, CERTAINLY WITHIN 50 MILES PER MINUTE ACCORDING TO HIS ESTIMATE. AFTER ABOUT A MINUTE OF STEADY MOVEMENT THE OBJECT STOPPED. IN SMALL SPURTS IT APPEARED TO BE GATHERING SPEED, ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY. THE WITNESSES WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT ANOTHER THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. SEVERAL OTHER CITIZENS WERE ALSO REPORTED TO HAVE SEEN THE OBJECT. ACCORDING TO THEIR STATEMENTS, THE OBJECT SEEMED TO TRAVEL VERY FAST AND GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED IN THE WESTERN JUNCTION. AFTER ABOUT A MINUTE OF STEADY MOVEMENT THE OBJECT STOPPED IN SMALL SPURTS IT APPEARED TO BE GATHERING SPEED, ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY. THE WITNESSES WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT ANOTHER THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. SEVERAL OTHER CITIZENS WERE ALSO REPORTED TO HAVE SEEN THE OBJECT. ACCORDING TO THEIR STATEMENTS, THE OBJECT SEEMED TO TRAVEL VERY FAST AND GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED IN THE WESTERN JUNCTION. THE SMALL CRAFT STATIONED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE LARGER ONE, AND IT APPEARS THAT THE LARGER OBJECT WAS CONTROLLING THE SMALLER CRAFT WITHIN A HALF-MILE RADIUS. THE MINISTER SAID IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 50 FEET IN DIAMETER. HE STATED THAT HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE LARGE OBJECT, ACCOMPANIED BY THE SMALL CRAFT, DID NOT MANEUVER TO RETURN INTO THE CLOUD, AS THE LARGE OBJECT HE SAID DID NOT DO THIS MANEUVER TO RETURN INTO THE CLOUD. THE OBJECT RETURNED TO THE CLOUD FASTER THAN IT HAD EMERGED, AND WAS GONE FROM SIGHT WITHIN THIRTY SECONDS. GROWING SAID HE REALIZED THE LARGE OBJECT WAS GOING TOWARD THE WEST JUNCTION, AND IT APPEARS THE OBJECT SAILED OFF INTO SOME UNKNOWN DIRECTION.
