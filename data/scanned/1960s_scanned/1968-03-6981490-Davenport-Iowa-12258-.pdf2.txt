The image appears to show a black, elongated object in the center of the frame against a cloudy or hazy background. While it resembles a photograph of what could be interpreted as an unidentified flying object (UFO), the image quality is relatively poor and does not provide much detail about the object's size, shape, or specific characteristics.

WITNESS DESCRIPTION:
STATEMENT - DAVENPORT, IOWA - 3-6-1968
I was driving to work alone when I noticed a bright light in the sky. As I watched, the light seemed to extend into an elongated shape. The object appeared dark in the center and emitted light from its periphery. I pulled off the road and got out of my car to observe it more closely. The object remained stationary for several minutes before rapidly accelerating and disappearing from view. I immediately reported the sighting to the police.
