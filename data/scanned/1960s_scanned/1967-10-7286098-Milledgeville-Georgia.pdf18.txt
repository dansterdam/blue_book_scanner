This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The text appears to be a transcript or record of a conversation between two individuals, Craig and an unnamed person, discussing an unidentified flying object (UFO) or object that they observed.

Craig: You don't think that it was a weather balloon?
No, sir. 
Craig: What do you think it was?
I don't think that I am qualified to say what it was. But it sure looked strange to me.
Craig: Do you think that you could duplicate something like that, it you had the equipment?
No, I don't think so. Not unless I really had some special equipment and took a lot of time on it.
Craig: I thought about it last night. We kept looking at my pictures to see if we could make out some things that they call refuses. It looked like two fringes, you know, up and down, and I could make out some colors - it was almost a solid color, but it wasn't.
If you made something like that, do you think that you could throw it over and get it to stay?
Well, I don't think so, not if I threw it up like that. Well, it just goes.
Craig: You couldn't keep it right side up?
I don't think so.
Craig: Could you make something like that and suspend it from a tree and a picture of it, while it hangs from a fish line, or something like that?
Sure. I mean, if I had the things, you know, I could probably do that. But I don't know if there are any brand marks on it that you can see, you know, in the picture.
Craig: There's not really any brand marks on it, the position to hang it, well, you see, I don't know what really happened, but there's where you have to take it to be as big as what you got.
I would probably have to take it to here. How do you mean, "from here?" The frisbee over the branch, from where you saw it. If the frisbee was right here, I would have to take it to be about the size of the one.
Craig: All right. If you took it from where you did, and it was frisbee, what would you do?
