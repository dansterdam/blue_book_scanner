The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing text.

Contrary to the article in the Dayton Journal Herald, the objects were moving north-ward instead of east.

b. As described in his letter and as brought out in the discussion, the objects changed course, first northwestward and then back toward the northeast.

c. The direction of his travel by car on I-75 was essentially straight and northward, although changes in the direction of his travel was admitted as a possible reason for observing an apparent maneuver in the travel of such objects, his reaction was that any recognized curvature in the section of I-75 being travelled at the time of the sighting would not account for the maneuvers.

d. Curvature noted in the tails extending back from the objects would correspond to the observed maneuvering.

e. The relative positions of the objects were not observed to change in such maneuvers.

f. I am bringing this matter directly to your attention for reasons of overall ETD interests in the implications of the maneuvering characteristics of the objects observed.
