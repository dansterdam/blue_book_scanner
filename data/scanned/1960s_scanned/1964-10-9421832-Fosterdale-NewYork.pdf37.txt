UFO SIGHTING SUMMARY SHEET

CASE REPORT: ________, 1964

WITNESS #1: 
Age: 59
Occupation: Farmer (6) 

PLACE: Westboorn, Massachusetts
DATE: 11 October 1964
TIME: 4:00 PM EDT

BACKGROUND: On the morning of October 11, 1964, a farmer and his son observed a UFO over a field on their farm for a period of approximately 2 1/2 hours. The object was described as a dark grey or black elliptical-shaped object, about 150-200 feet in diameter, hovering about 100-150 feet above the ground. The object appeared to be about 100 feet wide and 50 feet thick. It was silent, except for a slight hissing or rushing sound. The object remained stationary for the entire observation period, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight.

SITUATION: The witness and his son were startled by the appearance of the object and observed it closely. They were apparently quite shaken by the experience, as the report indicates that they were "still partially stunned" when they were interviewed. Condition of the witness was normal, with no physiological effects noted. The object was observed under good visibility conditions, with no cloud cover.
