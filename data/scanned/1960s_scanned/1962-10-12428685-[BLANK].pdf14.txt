SUBJECT: Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14
1. Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects, has been in continuous operation since 1947. Its purpose is to collect, analyze, and evaluate data on unidentified flying objects; and to determine if they represent something new of scientific interest, a threat to national security, or simply misidentified conventional objects.
2. Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 summarizes the results of the Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects for the period 1 January 1955 through 30 April 1963. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of all cases investigated during this period and presents the Air Force's conclusions regarding the nature of unidentified flying objects.
3. The report concludes that no unidentified flying object reported, investigated, and evaluated by Project Blue Book has ever given any indication of a threat to our national security. Further, there is no evidence that unidentified flying objects represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientific knowledge. In short, the report states that the continued study of unidentified flying objects does not offer a fruitful field in which to gather scientific data.
