JOURNAL MONDAY AUGUST 2, 1965

Labor
(10:30 am)
Republican presidential candidate
Nelson Rockefeller predicted
"another glorious victory" for the
GOP in 1966. He claimed that
President Johnson did not have a
clear legislative program and that the
Goldwater candidacy had weakened
the party. He promised political policies
would be shaped on a "bipartisan
basis."
William was reported to
have spoken at a press
conference in Washington
on the British space
program. He said that
the announcement of
the closure of the
Blue Streak and
Skylark projects should
be regarded as a
demonstration of Britain's
intention to move away
from an independent nuclear
deterrent and toward "collective
defense within the alliance."
Speaking at Royal Holloways,
Lord Chalfont, a Minister of
State in the Foreign Office, said
Sunday night Britain's defense
policy was a system whereby we
obtain the maximum collective
security at the minimum cost.

LBJ
Johnson accused Republicans Sunday
of trying to throw Republican Senator
Thurmond out of the party for favoring
the nomination of Georgia's Ellis
Arnall. "If Thurston Thurmond can
be ruled a Republican, we'll call
for a restoration of consistency,"
Johnson added. He said Republicans
did not have any thing to do
with Johnson's nomination or
convention.

The President said that
most of the people the U.S. is
trying to help in South
Viet Nam are members of
a couple of hundred,
families - the richest, the most
elite and most unwilling
to submit to reform.
"This is an Oligarchy
that will make its
sacrifices."

Objects
(Continued from Page 8)
objects are highly fantastic 1* The case is
still being investigated. Your information
clearly shows that there is more to this than
meets the eye. Our information seems to
show that the "objects" were with the U.S.
Weather Bureau, which was conducting
research as we reported. We may be wrong 
but our information seems to indicate this.
At one point, with the report coming in, the 
radio that reported the objects cut out.
"Dunk, there goes another one."
Toward the end, a postscript wasadded: 
"All equipment aboard the vehicle was
the funny house."
But shortly after 11 the sound 
picked up again, and they were
able to get all on the wire. 
There was a sign on the stand
that was alleged to be
"West Indies..."
