TAKE 1.
2-4-64 - SJ. The object was first observed about 9:30 p.m., 2-4-64 by the two main witnesses, Mr. A and Mrs. B, who were in the kitchen of their home. It was observed for about 30 minutes till 10:00 p.m. The object was described as circular in shape, bright orange in color, and it seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. It appeared to be about a mile distant and at an estimated altitude of about 3,000 feet.
The object appeared to come to a sudden stop, then make an abrupt turn and head off in another direction at a high rate of speed, then slow down again.
At one point, the object appeared to send out a beam of light which illuminated the ground below for a short distance. The object was observed to repeat this action several times.
There were no clouds in the sky and the weather was clear. No other unidentified objects were observed in the sky at this time.
The two witnesses, Mr. A and Mrs. B, are considered to be reliable, trustworthy, and intelligent observers. There is no reason to doubt their integrity or the accuracy of their observations.
