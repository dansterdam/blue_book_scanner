There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document appears to be a memorandum discussing a final report on the "Preview of Motion Picture 'Unidentified Flying Objects.'"

The text of the document is as follows:

MEMORANDUM FOR: Office of the Scientific Advisor
SUBJECT: Final Report - Preview of Motion Picture "Unidentified Flying Objects"

Reference is made to memorandum from this office, dated 3 June 1966, which requested that the attached motion picture film be made available for viewing. This report is attached.

In view of the fact that the film report was made in order to immediately provide the Directors of the Intelligence and PIO with some advisory comments on the film, a more detailed review will be necessary after further analysis of the data and localities of the UFO sightings portrayed were recorded, providing more specific comments upon which to make a better comparison with the project files.

The following represent the general and specific comments of this office on the preliminary report referenced in part 1 above (in order of sightings shown):

General Comments: The general comments and opinions stated in the preliminary report, para 2a, are substantially correct.

Specific Comments and Conclusions of Each UFO Case: (in order shown)

(1) Kenneth Arnold Case (Mt. Rainier, Wash.): This was the first UFO case in the United States which received widespread attention. It was not commented on in the preliminary report. The technical details of this case, as described by Kenneth Arnold, indicate objects showing definite shape, and stated that objects seemed "to fly in a formation, but they were not in a uniform formation."
