UFO SIGHTING, 25 JUNE 1966

HQ USAF (SAFPIC)

Reference the attached unidentified flying object report from Mr. and Mrs. ______________ on the following:

a. Dear Mr. and Mrs. ______________:

Contact was made with the Federal Aviation Agency at the Airport Control Tower in Akron, Ohio, who confirmed the sighting as reported by the _______________ on 25 June 1966. The FAA informed us that the Goodyear Blimp was flying in the area between 2330 - 2345 hours and was in the air around the time of the sighting.

We in turn contacted Mr. ______________ of the Goodyear Company who provided the following information.

"On 25 June the Goodyear Blimp was flying in the Akron, Ohio area between 2300-2345 hours. The blimp has lights that are required by the FAA, and in addition had attached to it a tow line with 1200 foot string lights measuring 300 feet in length which were illuminated.

We were puzzled that such a craft would be flying at night, but the blimp was the only vehicle flying in the area at 2330 hours."

Persons advertising gimmicks such as this are often mistaken by slow moving of the craft towing the electrical advertising sign. We trust your consideration to this matter.

FOR THE COMMANDER
