It looked like a rectangular shaped object. Its size was approximately 1/4 the size of the moon and it appeared to be about 15-20 degrees above the horizon. It was silver in color and seemed to be stationary. There was no noise or exhaust trailing from the object. I had intended to watch the object further, but it disappeared from view before I could take any photographs.
