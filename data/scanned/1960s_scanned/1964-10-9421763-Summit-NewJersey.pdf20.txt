SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI (Major Jacks)
WADDC 20330

1. Reference the attached letter from Mr. ---- of Binghamton, N.Y. requesting information on UFO projects. Previous correspondence on this subject has been received from Mr. ---- in May and June of 1964. The following information is in response to his request:

Dear Mr. ---- :

Your statement that the Air Force receives over 100 reports on UFO sightings is incorrect. The Air Force receives only a small fraction of the total UFO reports. The sightings in the Binghamton - Endicott area during April and May 1964 were reported to NICAP, New York City. The Air Force has no additional information about the sightings and all of the reports were determined to be natural phenomena.

A resume of the sightings is as follows: An aircraft flying from southwest to northeast with red and green lights; an aircraft flying from north to south with red and green lights; a bright meteor from west to east with a red and green trail; and a bright meteor from northeast to southwest with a red and yellow trail. None of these sightings were attributed to UFO's. The natural explanation is that they were aircraft and natural phenomena.

Sincerely,
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Technology and Subsystems

FOR THE COMMANDER
