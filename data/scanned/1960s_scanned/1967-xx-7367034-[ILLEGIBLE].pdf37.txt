There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in the provided document. The document appears to be a typed text describing a UFO sighting incident.

I talked to lt. Carr. about the sighting. He has not investigated it yet, however he is going to investigate. All information that he has is completely second hand. He has received through news media the following:

A little before 0400 1 a wife of Cossiat woke up and saw a bright object skimming over the tree tops. She observed it for about 15 min.

Sometimes before 0400 1 a farmer from Farmaburch namedwho saw a red tinged object that hurt his eyes when he looked at it.

At about 0.001 two police officers from Golsin ( one was the assist. chief of police) saw a circular object that was about a mile away. The object emitted blue rays that hurt their eyes. The object was first headed SE but then turned E. They followed it for about 2 mile till it turned NW. They continued to follow another 2 mile till their car had a flat tire and they were forced to stop.

At about the same time a motorist was on the road from Golsin to Strawberry and a bright object that hurt his eyes. It seemed to go too slowly to be an airplane. He followed it for a while but finally lost it.

A little later three girls at Prairie Du Chien reported seeing a UFO to the kids at the school (?) they attend.
