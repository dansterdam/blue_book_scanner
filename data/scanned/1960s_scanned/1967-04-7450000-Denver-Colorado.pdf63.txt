SPACE TRASH
Hynek to Investigate
Libertyville Metal
Metallic fragments found on
a road four miles northwest of
Libertyville are being examined by
United States or Russian space
vehicles, a Northwestern University astronomer who also
is an air force scientific consultant
of unidentified flying objects said
last night.
Dr. J. Allen Hynek said the
fragments, which he described as
beads, definitely were not
parts of a meteorite. He said he
explained as neither
remains of a re-entry of an unidentified satellite nor a crash
of space trash.
The fragments answered the
radar at an airport in Lake
county and were brought to
O'Hare field, Hynek said.
"It could be space trash,"
Hynek said, "but I don't know.
I'll have to investigate."
A "brilliant flash"
was seen in the sky in that area
by residents the night before the
fragments were found.
"No sound with flash
occurred," Demier said. "The
flash had no sound, but caused
little green spots in front of
my eyes."
Demier said he

looked out of his picture window, thinking someone may
have driven into his driveway.
Checking to see if it would
other members of his family,
the Deputy Sheriff of Lake
county came up and took the
fragments that were lying in the
road.
"Looks like some space
stuff," he up the the
Desmier said.
He then went and
investigated. He said
samples were taken for analysis,
where the fragments were found
because "it was too hot."
Hynek said the "beads"
he found about a half dozen
Desmier were a "kind of gray,
brown material."
Demier called Deputy Sheriff Larry Willner of the Lake
county sheriff's police department made a report to the sheriff's
office.
A reporter for The Tribune
took a sample of the particles
along with Desmier, who immediately said: "This is very
hot. It's radioactive." He based his
conclusion on the Geiger counter
Demier said that the particles
emitted a "faint glow" and
smelled like "burning rubber"
and "electrical smoke."
Hynek said he would take
the particles, which he said is
the first he has seen, to the
observatory, Wilmette, to
analysis.
