SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)

1. The following report is submitted in the interest of the USAF*s
ATIC Project BLUE BOOK. On 8 June 1964, at approximately 11:50 hours, a
bright unidentified object was observed by several personnel at this base.
The object was first observed at an azimuth of 270 degrees and an elevation
of 30 degrees, bearing in a westerly direction. It was observed for
approximately 3-4 minutes, after which it rapidly accelerated and disappeared
from view. During the period of observation, the object appeared to be round
and extremely bright, much brighter than the sun. It could still be seen
behind the trees. No sound was heard. The object moved with a rapid, level
flight path and exhibited no exhaust or trail. Several attempts were made to
photograph the object, but due to the extreme brightness, no photographs were
obtained.
