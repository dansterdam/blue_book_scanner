13 March 1960

Dear Mrs. [Redacted],

Your letter of 15 February 1960 addressed to the U.S. Army has been referred to this office.

The probable cause of the sounds you experienced is sonic booms and the unusual configuration of the area where you live is fully and amply illustrated by the sound and echoes could continue to visit you heard.

The 1935 sighting you describe was probably caused by light reflected from the dome of the Lick Observatory.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
