RE: TDSATOFF
Rec'd 7-7-67
As I was entering the edge of my front yard, I looked up and saw a very bright light in the sky, much brighter than the stars, rapidly moving and spinning. It came to a sudden, practically vertical stop, stopped for a moment, then zoomed straight up and was out of sight in a few seconds. I got a good look at it and I'm quite sure it was not an airplane, satellite, or any other normal aircraft. My wife saw it too. We were both puzzled and somewhat awed by the performance of this object in the sky.
Over the years I've heard of many similar sightings of UFOs in this area and am wondering what the explanation might be. I wonder if you could give me any information or advice as to how I might report this and any similar sightings in the future.
Sincerely,
