April 7, 1966
Baltimore, Maryland

On the evening of April 7, 1966, at approximately 8:30 pm, the writer received a telephone call from Mr. Conrad, Civil Defense Director, Baltimore County, Maryland. Mr. Conrad stated that a number of citizens of Dundalk, Maryland, had reported seeing an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky over that area at approximately 8:00 pm.

Mr. Conrad requested that the writer proceed to the area and make an investigation of the reports. The writer immediately departed for the area in question.

Upon arrival in the Dundalk area, the writer contacted several citizens who had reported seeing the UFO. These citizens stated that at approximately 8:00 pm, they had observed a bright, luminous object maneuvering in the sky over the Dundalk area. The object was described as being round or oval in shape and approximately the size of a basketball. The object appeared to be bluish-white in color and was observed to make rapid, jerky movements as it traveled across the sky. The object was observed for a period of approximately 10 to 15 minutes before it disappeared from sight.

The writer then proceeded to a high school in the Dundalk area and interviewed the science instructor, Mr. Jones, who stated that he and several of his students had also observed the UFO. Mr. Jones corroborated the descriptions given by the other witnesses.

The writer then returned to the Civil Defense Office and reported the results of the investigation to Mr. Conrad.
