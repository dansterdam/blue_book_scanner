UFOs Over England

On January 15, 1963 at around 5:25 pm, several people in the Bristol, England area observed a number of unidentified flying objects described as being like a "ball of fire" descending in a zig-zag pattern. The objects hovered for about 10 minutes at Bristol, England. It then disintegrated and disappeared. An hour later a similar object was seen moving rapidly across the Bristol channel. The day before, a witness in London reported seeing a similar object moving at high speed. It was the sighting of the 14th.
