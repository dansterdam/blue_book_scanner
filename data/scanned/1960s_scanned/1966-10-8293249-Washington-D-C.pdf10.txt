The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page includes a questionnaire or form with various questions about the observed object, such as whether it disappeared while being observed, whether it moved behind or in front of something, and descriptions of its sound and color. The respondent has provided handwritten answers to these questions. The image also includes a hand-drawn sketch or diagram illustrating the object's movement and direction.

Text extracted from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, gradually faded away and became obscured.

15. Did the object move behind something or at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes, No, Don't Know. 
If you answered YES, then tell what:
Moved behind a cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes, No, Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what:
Moved out from behind a cloud.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Steady, no sound.
b. Color: Bright white, appeared very large.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
1966 - Diameter of object about 3/4 of inch at arms length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
