There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "Y" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? (LARGER 100 YARDS ACROSS)

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

Would probably have covered the head of a match.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

NOT GONE, JUST FADED INTO BACKGROUND AS IT WENT OVERHEAD.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a celestial object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The light size is approximately as a star, but brighter and moving faster than a star.
