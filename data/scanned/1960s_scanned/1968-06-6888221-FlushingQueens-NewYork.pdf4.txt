The image appears to contain a photograph of three objects or unidentified flying objects (UFOs) aligned horizontally. The objects seem to be oval or disc-shaped in nature. There is no other text or information visible in the image besides the handwritten note "real view" at the top.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:
