A timetable of events, with considerable uncertainty, as follows:

8:19 - Called by dispatcher: sees object to NW
8:20 - Overhears calls: sees object to west
8:22 - It sees object to NW, does out side and calls
8:25 - Turns down Riley Street, Heerespink o Cedar Street. Sees object, not watching
8:27 - Object appears outside again: first object seen suddenly appears, moves to position over road. Sees object again, object in west.
8:35 - Lost object behind houses, sees object to west.
8:36 - Lost object - faded or moved down.
8:37 - Object disappears suddenly without notice to south.
8:40 - Arrives at lakeshore: nothing visible
9:00 - Sees objects to south. 
9:30 - Sees 2 in binoculars, report UFO in middle of course.

The principal objections to some possible explanations are (a) the rapidity and size of the object (b) the sound and (c) the sudden disappearance. Confidential motives.

Brightness. UFO reports were received at Ottawa County Department by the investigator, which involved an extremely bright object identified as Venus. This took place the evening of the same date. The object - he said it was much brighter, but Venus loses its brilliance and appears 2 - 3 magnitudes dimmer than normal.
