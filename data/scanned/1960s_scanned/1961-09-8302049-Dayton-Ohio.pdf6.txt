The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page contains two sketches.

The first sketch shows a curved trajectory of an object, with the instructions to place a "A" on the sketch to indicate where the object was first seen, and a "B" on the same curved line to indicate where the object was last seen.

The second sketch shows a landscape view with a person standing in the foreground, and two smaller sketches in the corners. The text accompanying this sketch states "NOT too much detail".

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, show the position the object was in when you first saw it, and a "B" to show its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

NOT too much detail.
