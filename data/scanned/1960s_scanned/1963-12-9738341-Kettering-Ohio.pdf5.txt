The image contains a diagram with an angular trajectory line and a circular object in the top right corner. The diagram appears to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "G" on the curve where the object was closest to the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
