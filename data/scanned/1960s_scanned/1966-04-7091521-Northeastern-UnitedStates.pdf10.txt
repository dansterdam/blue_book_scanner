Dear Sir:

I wish to report that at approximately 2:10 this morning I observed an extremely unusual object flying through the sky. It appeared to be hovering and then suddenly disappeared. The object was round in shape and silvery in appearance. It hovered at a very high altitude and was not an aircraft of any kind that I am familiar with. The object did not seem to make any sound and there were no lights visible on it. I would be very interested to know if any other reports of this nature have been made in this area.

Sincerely,
Class of 1966
