There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document containing text only.

Transcribing the text from the document:

GENERAL COMMENTS: It is interesting that all witnesses have agreed that the object was observed for only a short time, even the photographer, as can be verified by the written statement that the camera shutter was open only for a brief moment.

Even the photographer, although he obtained what may be a photograph of the object, has indicated that he saw the object only for an instant, and that only a small part of the object may have been recorded on the film. This would indicate that the object was moving rapidly.

The photographs, although they may be valid, should be considered as secondary in importance to the written statements obtained from the witnesses, as the photographic evidence can be confusing and misleading. The written statements, on the other hand, are clear and straightforward and are considered the best evidence in this case.
