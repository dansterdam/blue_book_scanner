The image appears to contain a photograph of an unidentified aerial object. The image is grainy and low-quality, but it shows what appears to be a dark, elongated shape floating in the air. There is no text or other identifying information visible in the photograph itself.

Regarding the text:

On August the 17th, we had a rainfall in western new York and a number of the residents saw some small objects come down with the rain. We didn't realize until my name showed up in some of the reports, so I am enclosing a few details.
I would not bother you with these but I recall you once said that you were interested with these data drops. they seemed to linger a while, became motionless and then suddenly disappeared from sight.
I thought if these pellets are some kind of experiments you might like to know about them.
Yours sincerely,
