The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text on a blank page. I will now proceed to transcribe the text from the image:

The two saw an object approaching them at a high rate of speed. It passed over the car at a height of approximately 200 ft. and disappeared from sight in the distance. The object was round and silver in color and appeared to have a rim around the outer edge. It made no sound.
