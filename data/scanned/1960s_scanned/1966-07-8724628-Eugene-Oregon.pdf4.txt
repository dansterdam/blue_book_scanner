The image does not contain any photographs, only text. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
About 25 feet. It went out.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): YES NO Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.
It drifted behind some tall trees and was obscured.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): YES NO Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what
it moved in front of.
It did pass in front of the trees.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - seemed to be quiet, no noticeable sound.
b. Color - red or orange, bright like a light bulb.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About 5.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[A hand-drawn sketch is included showing a round object with no visible features.]

I went to dive away to disappear to a height of 200 feet maximum.
