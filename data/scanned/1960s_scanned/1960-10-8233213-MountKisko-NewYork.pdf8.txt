31 October 1960

This will acknowledge your letter of 9 October 1960 concerning an unidentified flying object you sighted on 27 October.

Your letter contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion. The few questions we are asked to answer and forward to you, concerning the object, are: apparent size, apparent distance, duration of sighting, direction of flight, angular velocity or speed (approximately 200 miles per hour or less), weather conditions at time of sighting.

From the general description of the object you sighted, it appears to be a satellite, but (the direction or speed) are not specific enough for our analysis and/or conclusions.

Sincerely, 

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
