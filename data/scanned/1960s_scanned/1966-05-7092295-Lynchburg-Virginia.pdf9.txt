Dear sirs:

I would like to report to you a siting of an unidentified flying object that occurred on the night of March 31, 1967. On this evening, my wife and I were outside in our backyard in Roanville, Georgia, when we noticed a strange object in the sky. It was hovering silently, and appeared to be metallic or reflective in nature. It made no sound and did not flash any lights. We watched it for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a very high speed and disappeared from view. 

We were quite surprised and disturbed by this experience, as we had never seen anything like it before. I am writing to you in hopes that you may have some insight or information on what we witnessed. Please let me know if you have any other questions or would like additional details.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

P.S. Wanna goof Around sat 20!
