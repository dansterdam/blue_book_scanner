The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing questions about the details of a reported UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES,

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES,

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the match head? If you had performed this experiment at the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
