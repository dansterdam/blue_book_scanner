The image does not contain any photographs, but rather an official document from the Project Blue Book archives. 

The text in the document reads:

November 25, 1963

"This refers to your letter of November 5, 1953, in which you reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object on September 14th.

Your sighting has been evaluated as a Hoax. The duration was much greater than is normally indicated by the duration as well as the detail in the description. As indicated by the duration it is well within the capabilities for an aircraft to be in the area southwest of Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, with the reported observations.

As the sightings are so much greater than is normally received, this case is listed over 3,550 listed over 2,500 cases without discovery or solution."

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
