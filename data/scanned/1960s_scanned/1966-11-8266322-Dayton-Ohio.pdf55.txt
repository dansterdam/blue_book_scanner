REGARDING MY ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD OF TIME THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE, THE FOLLOWING OCCURRED:  IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING MOTIONLESS AROUND 250 FEET OUT OF THE SCHOOL BUILDING INTO THE PARKING LOT. AFTER ABOUT 30 SECONDS IT STARTED TO LIFT OFF AND HOVERED ABOUT 15 FEET OFF THE GROUND FOR A FEW SECONDS BEFORE MAKING A VERY FAST DEPARTURE.  IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 20 FEET IN DIAMETER AND DISK-SHAPED.  IT WAS OBSERVED BY AT LEAST ONE BLINKING OR FLASHING LIGHT ON ITS UNDERSIDE.  WHEN IT BEGAN TO LIFT OFF, IT SEEMED TO JUST HANG SUSPENDED IN THE AIR FOR A MOMENT BEFORE DARTING AWAY AT A TREMENDOUS RATE OF SPEED.  IT HEADED STRAIGHT UP AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN ABOUT 5 SECONDS.  IT SEEMED TO BE MOVING AT A CONSTANT VELOCITY.  IT APPEARED TO INCREASE AND DECREASE IN VELOCITY, OR TO HAVE VARYING PERIODS OF ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION.  THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE TRANSLUCENT OR SEMI-TRANSPARENT, AND SEEMED TO BE REFLECTING OR REFRACTING THE LIGHT AROUND IT.  WHEN IT WAS HOVERING, IT SEEMED TO OSCILLATE SLIGHTLY IN THE AIR, ALMOST AS IF IT WERE PULSATING.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS, BUT IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANYTHING CONVENTIONAL THAT I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE.  THE ENTIRE SIGHTING LASTED LESS THAN A MINUTE.
