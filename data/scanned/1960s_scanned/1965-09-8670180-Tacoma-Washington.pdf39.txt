Dear Dr. Hanes,
Ed and I did go to Kramer big yesterday and made a positive identification of the object sighted on September 24. It was apparently a meteor, bright green color, travelling from north to south. Broke up into three parts and completely disappeared. It was visible for about 5 seconds. I consider this to be a positive identification although the details given in the original report are somewhat vague. I hope this information is of some help to you.
Sincerely,
Norman G. Nelson, 9/27/62
