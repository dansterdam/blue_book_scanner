Dear Sirs:

It was very early Sunday, July 7, 1968, at 1:30 AM, in Woodridge, N.Y. when my wife and I were awakened by our dog and saw a very bright light, hovering in the sky just over the house. Several other people in the neighborhood watched the big object seem to move at a high rate of speed, but then the power to stay that course and came down to the ground. It looked normal, but then the object began to pulsate and started moving up and down in a diagonal from point to point. The 2 stars to the right of the object went behind the object and came out the other side. The whole incident was witnessed by several people and I think one complete motion was about 15 minutes. The object made no sound and seemed to light up the whole area. After making one complete motion, it just disappeared as in a flash.

Sincerely,
Name and Address Redacted
