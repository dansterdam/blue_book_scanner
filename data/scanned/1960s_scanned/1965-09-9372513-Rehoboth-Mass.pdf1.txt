2. LOCATION: Rehoboth, Mass.
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Few seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: Down
8. PHOTOS: NO
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NO
10. CONCLUSION: Other (MISINTERPRETATION OF CONVENTIONAL OBJECT)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Object looked like a long tube, object had a blue and red band at the rear, looked like it was giving off yellow sparks. Observed it for a few seconds while driving a car. Report is very messy and disorganized. It gives the feeling that the observer is of low intellect. She states that she is very enthused with "sky objects".
The cause of the sighting could have been an aircraft, possibly an aircraft with advertising sign. It might have been a meteor. There is nothing in the report to indicate anything other than a misinterpretation of some conventional object or natural phenomenon.
