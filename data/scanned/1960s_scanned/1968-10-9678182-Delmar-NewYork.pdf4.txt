The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text in the document is:

Is there any information of value that may have existed on that destroyed part of the pages as indicated. 1. That may have contained information of value to our investigation. As we seem to have missed what may have been clues or evidence of importance. The envelope containing the pages was also destroyed and no copy exists. I must report that this is most regrettable and unsatisfactory as we have now lost any chance of following up this lead or case. I hope that you will understand that this is a great disappointment to me and my staff, as we were anxiously awaiting the arrival of these pages to further our investigations. We will of course continue our efforts in this area in the hope that some other lead may present itself in due course. 
Yours faithfully,
