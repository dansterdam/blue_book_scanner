Dear Sir,
This is to thank you for your recent letter addressed to Vandenberg Air Force Base concerning sightings by radar *
In order to evaluate your sightings, I am including a standard Air Force UFO questionnaire that you complete and return to me for detail for those sightings. I will order these completed questionnaires to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson for analysis and evaluation.
The Air Force appreciates your initiative in reporting your sightings as this may be important scientific information.
Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER
