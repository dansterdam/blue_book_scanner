Memo for the Records: 13 March 67

Received call from Civil Defense director at Ashland, Kentucky reporting a UFO which was observed by Mrs. Georgia Elliot of Greenup, Kentucky.

Call to Mrs. Elliot revealed the following description:
At 1930 Hours the witness observed a star like object coming from the northern sky. The object traveled slowly toward the west and an unidentified aircraft was seen and traveled toward the west. As the plane got close to the UFO the lights on the UFO went out and never reappeared during the next several minutes. The adult witness only saw the object in the western sky. Her daughter saw it coming from the north star, so the adult witness figured the UFO must have come from the north. The object was brighter than the stars. The center of the object was white and the outside edges were a lighter blue and blue. It looks like the object had spheres on the outside. The witness said that she heard a light humming sound.
