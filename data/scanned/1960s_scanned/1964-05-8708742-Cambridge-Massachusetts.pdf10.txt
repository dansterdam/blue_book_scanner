Dear Dr. Hynek:

Thank you for forwarding the letter which you have received referring to the observational data of the 9 May 64, Chicago sighting. This letter, as you know, was written by me and contained a request for additional information which I hope you will be able to obtain from the observers.

Sincerely,
