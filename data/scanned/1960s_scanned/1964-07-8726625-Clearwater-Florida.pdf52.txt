Dear Capt. Sturdy
My witness's statement contains the following details:
My witness was driving his automobile on a straight highway around 9:15 PM when he observed a strange rectangular object, flat on the bottom, convex on top, hovering over the highway about 50 feet above the ground. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and was not making any noise. The object moved slowly in a north-westerly direction for about 2 or 3 minutes and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared. 
The witness was so impressed by the performance of the object that he called the local authorities at once to report the incident. 
This case is considered important by the project staff and deserves further investigation.
