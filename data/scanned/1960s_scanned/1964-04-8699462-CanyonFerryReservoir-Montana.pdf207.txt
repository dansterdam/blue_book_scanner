Request for UFO Information, Donald G Winterton

Be USAF SAPOICC (Mrs Hunt)
Washington, D C 20330

Reference are two attached letters from Donald G Winterton
requesting information on unidentified flying objects.  Mr
Winterton is a frequent correspondent and has received the
current fact sheets.  The following information is provided
in order that a reply may be made:

a.  No report was received by the Air Force, Project
Blue Book, for 6 April 1964, Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  It
is suggested that Mr Winterton write to the local area newspapers for additional information.

b.  His letter of 13 July contains statements contrary
to fact.

   (1) The Brazilian Navy Intelligence Report did not
confirm the authenticity of the photographs.

   (2) The Air Force received its information from
the United States Navy and the case file contains no information from the Brazilian Navy.  

   (3) The Air Force did not evaluate the photographs.
The photographs were evaluated by the US Navy and are
regarded as hoaxes.

206 - 21 (4) It is suggested that Mr Winterton read pages
209 - 215 from the "World of Flying Saucers" by Donald H.
Menzel, which provide accurate accounts of the incidents.
