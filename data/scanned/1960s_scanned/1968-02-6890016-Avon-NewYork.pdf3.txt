1 APRIL 1968  

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. CM ------ 11 REPORT THE FIRST TIME ANYTHING UNUSUAL -------- HAPPENED. ON THE EVE OF 1 APRIL 1968, ALONE IN THE HOUSE,   THE CAT AND I OBSERVED AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT AND PENETRATING LIGHT COMING FROM OUTSIDE. UPON LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW WHICH FACED NORTH, I SAW A BRILLIANT CIRCULAR LIGHT, LIKE A LARGE STAR, HOVERING ABOUT 1,000 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FULL MOON AND BRILLIANT WHITE IN COLOR. PULSATING RAPIDLY FROM VERY BRIGHT TO DIMMER, IT SEEMED TO BE GETTING BRIGHTER WITH EACH PULSATION. AT NO TIME DID IT REMAIN STEADILY BRIGHT OR DIM. IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING IN ONE SPOT AND DID NOT MOVE AT ALL DURING THE APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES I WATCHED IT. AS SOON AS I OBSERVED IT, I BECAME EXTREMELY EXCITED AND APPREHENSIVE. I QUICKLY GRABBED FOR MY EYEGLASSES AND PEERED OUT THE WINDOW AGAIN. IT WAS STILL THERE, PULSATING BRIGHTLY. I THEN HURRIEDLY WENT TO GET MY WIFE, WHO WAS ASLEEP IN THE BEDROOM. AWAKENING HER, I EXCITEDLY TOLD HER TO COME AND LOOK. BY THE TIME SHE CAME TO THE WINDOW, THE OBJECT HAD DISAPPEARED. SHE WAS RATHER SKEPTICAL AND FELT THAT I HAD BEEN DREAMING. I WAS QUITE DISTURBED BY THE INCIDENT AND FELT THAT IT WAS SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL AND ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE. ALTHOUGH I HAVE SEEN AIRCRAFT, SATELLITES AND METEORS IN THE PAST, THIS WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING I HAD EVER OBSERVED BEFORE. THE PULSATING LIGHT AND EXTREME BRILLIANCE, COMBINED WITH ITS HOVERING MOTIONLESS POSITION, MADE ME FEEL THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT OR OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENON. I AM QUITE CERTAIN THAT WHAT I SAW WAS NOT IMAGINARY OR A DREAM. IT WAS REAL AND DEFINITELY SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL AND OUT OF THE ORDINARY. MY PRINCIPAL REASON FOR REPORTING THIS SIGHTING IS THAT I FEEL IT MAY HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANCE OR IMPORTANCE TO YOUR INVESTIGATION. ALSO, I HOPE THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN OR IDENTIFY WHAT I ACTUALLY SAW.
