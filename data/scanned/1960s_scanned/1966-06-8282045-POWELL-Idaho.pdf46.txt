PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 55-11. DATED 16 November 1955

There are several methods by which this photograph could be made. These methods could have been highly or in combination:

1. Double printing technique, utilizing a positive transparency in register over the negative.

2. Multiple exposure technique by first photographing the basic scene then painting the camera lens, excluding and smoothly transitioning a smaller or differently lit scene portion. This could give a "pulsating" light effect.

3. Recording the basic scene and adding and deleting elements such as a small light source in front of the lens is obtain the "pulsating" light effect.

Frame #2 - This appears to have been done with two separate exposures, possibly from two different cameras or film. Teticings a & b and c and d are identical in general shape differing only in width. This suggests a double exposure, with different lighting sources on the camera, by opening the shutter and uniformly "painting" the image an different areas of the frame.

Frame #3 - The invisible, transparent, and weightless appearance identified as "a" is in essence a stereoscopic image (presumably from either of the lights or camera). From this, it could have been accomplished by the aforementioned double printing techniques. (See frame #1)

Frame #5 - The analysis was made of the length of the star trace versus time to correlate the stated measure time and distances, utilizing multiple techniques.
