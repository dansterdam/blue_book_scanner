UNCLASSIFIED

In the past 12 years I have had opportunities to observe a variety of phenomena - unexplained inversion, false returns, birds - and numerous other objects but never a single case moving with the speed and direction indicated by the signed and dated report.

NOTE: These are statements by RAPCON radar scope observers taken by DAVID M. VAUGHAN, Chief, Target Intelligence Branch, 5th USAF.
