The image contains two sketches or diagrams. The larger diagram appears to be a compass rose with directions labeled, suggesting it is intended to help indicate the direction of a sighted phenomenon. The smaller sketches on the right appear to depict a person's view of the horizon, with a silhouetted figure in the foreground and a curved horizon in the background.

Text output:

4A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE -- PLACE AN X AT THE POINT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. PLACE A Y AT THE POSITION TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A C ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A Y AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. AS OUTLINED ABOVE, INDICATE WHETHER THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
