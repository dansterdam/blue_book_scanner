Certainly in law, in medicine or in the many branches
of the sciences, evidence as well attested would certainly
be accepted in court. But it is understandable why it cannot
be so in the area in which we are dealing. We do need
strong and breakthrough here,and a breakthrough would consist
of more and more definite that occurred in propor- of a material
or material and their instruments, and which continue a prolonged
careful amounts or hardware--or we need a very prolonged
and devoted study to the evidence already at hand, even
though it may first the claims-compelling. For this is extremely the
some problem they should be studying. At least, it appears to me
that in the light of existing of the hypot-hesis that
have been put forward in cannot to which numerous ups and down
demands were present and phenomena lasted a reasonable length
of time. It is, of course, very easy to say "mass hallucination",
under what circumstances does mass hallucination occur?
What do we have that would substantiate that assertion? Do we have well attested
evidence of mass hallucinations which we can show a general over a group
of persons independently and often watched over considerable periods of time,
which have been stimulated to make the same report? I think
certainly we cannot say that we have strange circumstances. It
is possible to speculate effects. particularly close to the
natural explanations that we can and of the claim
that certain and play about for an hypothesis for some inexplicable
natural meteorological conditions would have to be predicable,
and I miss at least 9% of whether such meteorological conditions
existed at the time of what appears before we say that a mirror
reflection of some unusual craft hovering about the sky for
long periods of time would be considered to be the most normal hundred occurrences.
