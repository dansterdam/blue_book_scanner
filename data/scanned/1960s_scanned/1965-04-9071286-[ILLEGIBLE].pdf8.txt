the others, I got shook and realized I had just witnessed a U.F.O. (On, U.F.O.'s)
Right now, as I'm writing this down, I wonder if anyone else saw these lights besides me. Of course, I've heard reports of sightings and the like. Like most people, I believe what I see, and what I saw was not the usual. I don't think these same people would have seen it - I was to the point of 1900, I am out of a FOOD - in the looking at that particular moment and that particular patch of sky--------
Right now my emotions have died down and it's another page of my life---

Dear Sir(s):
Friends suggested I send this information to U.F.O. I typed this exactly as I wrote it on Monday night. There is an addition and correction I wish to make. 
The flight path was going from North to West. Well I know a picture of surprise --at directions instead. You take it from there--

Respectfully,
