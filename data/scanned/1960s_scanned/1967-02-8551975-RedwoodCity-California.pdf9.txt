Dear Sir:
On the evening of February 17, 1967, a neighbor and I were outside and noticed 3 bright lights in the western sky. They appeared to be about 5 miles away. They were weaving and darting about, not in any regular pattern, but seemed to be hovering most of the time. After watching them for about 15 minutes, they suddenly disappeared. One minute they were there and the next minute they were gone.
Could you please advise me as to a way of reporting this sighting and getting some information on it.
Thank you.
