II. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Two different observers watched an egg shaped fiery object pass overhead. Both observers stated that the object appeared to have exhaust or flame coming from the rear. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and disappeared from both witnesses' sight.
An F-101 was traveling a low level pass over runway 27 at Stewart AFB at approximately 2300. The pilot lit his afterburner and turned tight right by witnesses. The flight path would have taken this aircraft over the approximate time and location of the reported sighting. It is the opinion of both observers that the object they saw was most likely the afterburner of this aircraft.
