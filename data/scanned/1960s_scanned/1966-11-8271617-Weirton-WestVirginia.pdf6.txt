The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and sketches. The diagram shows a horizon line with different angles labeled on it, and a compass rose. The sketches appear to depict the motion or trajectory of an object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curve: line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass rose to show the direction from which the object came.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
