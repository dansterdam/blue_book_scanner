sations. The first time, Bell Telephone
scientists were unable to fix it satisfactorily. The second time, all attempts to fix it were
still unsuccessful, as the telephone company
people could not find out what was wrong.
The scientist stated that this was "definitely
Gremlins again."

The Milwaukee Journal for January
30, 1964, reports for the January
Staff Writer Harry G. Pesce, which dealt
with School Superintendent Dr. Harry
J. Sander's experience. Dr. Sander, Astronomical Society Satellite Tracker, told
Pesce on Thursday, January 30, that
shortly after 6 p.m. on January 29, he
and a small group of people saw a very
bright object in the sky for about five
seconds. High-magnification telescopic
examination showed it to be round and
headed toward the observer, then
seemed to pull away. It is in orbit at an
estimated 400 miles high. It appeared as
a brilliant white flash on the Lunar surface 60 miles from the predicted time
and position and was supposed to impact. The Fiords Ranger, so-called second
satellite, was thought to be behind the
moon. Ranger 6 was the Lunar probe destined for photography, the object seen
and photographed was not Ranger 6 and
did not function correctly in the last few
critical minutes on the moon. Furthermore, Ranger 6 crashed, the object seen
was the 10th Lunar probe to fail in its mission to photograph the moon. The only
successful one to date is the Russian
Luna 9. According to the British spokesman at Jodrell Bank, the Russians have
landed a single previous lander since the
shot.

And—on February 18, Space Science
Digest was at a loss to explain the disappearance of Syncom. It had been
launched the previous June from Cape
Kennedy. It's ultimate mission was to provide communications facilities for military
and other agencies. But so far, the radio
transmitter was not operating. All signals
cease d suddenly. No more were received. It
was postulated that it had been struck by a
meteor. In the case of Ranger 6 striking the moon and shattering, the metal parts of Ranger 6 were thought to have
knocked Syncom off-course and disabled it.
Both Syncom and two preceding U. S. satellites' last stage, but it is not logical that
the two objects which preceded Syncom were any part of the instrument package of Syncom. Three weeks later, the satellite was still missing with no trace.

To date, 14 Rangers to Lunar probes
have failed their missions, for various
reasons. The last two were lost due to
ruptures, due to lack of atmospheric
pressure; and the reasons for would
still unknown.

And—in March, six mysterious "obscene satellites" were detected in
space. The U.S. and Russia dislaim
ownership. They may be testing the
truth. Some experts think the satellites are mingled with our anti-satellite activities. "What?"
