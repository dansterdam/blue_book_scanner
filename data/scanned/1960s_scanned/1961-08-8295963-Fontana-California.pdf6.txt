The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

SUBJECT:  Analysis of Photographs

TO:  HQ USAF (SAFOI-3c - Major Coleman) 

1.  The attached photographs have been examined by the FTD photo analysis division in an attempt to identify the objects pictured. 

2.  The analysis concluded, however, that the objects were small, being superimposed on the negative possibly indicative of indoor exposures due to the fact that the light apparently came from a single source.  

3.  It is the analyst's opinion that the photographs are a deliberate hoax, and not a representation of any actual phenomena.
