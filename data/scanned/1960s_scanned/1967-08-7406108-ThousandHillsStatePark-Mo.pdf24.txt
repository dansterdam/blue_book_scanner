The image contains two illustrations. The top illustration is a compass rose, with the cardinal directions and intermediate compass points labeled. The bottom illustration appears to be a landscape scene with rolling hills or mountains in the background and a small, indistinct figure in the foreground.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "0" AT THE POSITION OF THE OBJECT WHEN LAST SEEN.

T. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE A "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "0" AT THE

THE INSTRUCTIONS ON A SKETCH.
