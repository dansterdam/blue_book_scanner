The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report, likely from Project Blue Book, describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

Transcription of the text in the document:

There was only the one object?
The object was a luminous thing. It seemed to have little features such as you find on manmade objects. However, it saw only a slender object. I don't know what the shape called it 'negative.' There was no exhaust, no trail following it. It disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.  

Was there any sound?
Other than the noise of the aircraft, there was none that I heard or know. The aircraft, of course, was in the distance and the sound accompanying the glow was not heard.

The motion was smooth and the air was smooth too. The aircraft remained such - no jerking, no abrupt changes in the motion.

Nor do I recall any pertinent or unusual features?
And the thing that first called your attention to the object it- self, what did it resemble most closely overhead?
Now, when you observed the object itself, would you give any thoughts on its texture and that which I saw it - The object, when I first spotted it, resembled a star and I thought that was exactly what it was. As it came closer, it seemed larger and more brilliant, and somewhat oval shaped. And it assumed the vertical or 70 to 80 degree angle from the horizontal.
And that was the beginning, the air craft came from 130 to 135 degrees from the nose of the aircraft. I believe its altitude was approximately 65 to 75 degrees from the nose of the aircraft, and it was not far from the aircraft. And it was approximately the same angle, elevation, azimuth at which it disappeared. 
The object, then, disappeared on the same atl angle.

Now, I don't know what it was. I can't imagine. It was just a luminous, sudden not there.
