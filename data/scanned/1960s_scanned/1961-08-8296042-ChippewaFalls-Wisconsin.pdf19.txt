The text contained in the document is as follows:

"This was just about the middle of one course, all of a sudden a light appeared, and seemed to be from a "machine". It remained stationary for a short time and then moved to the north-east at a very high rate of speed. I watched it for a few seconds and then it seemed to disappear. I notified my instructor at the time and he seemed quite interested as well as several other students who had also observed the same phenomena. 
I saw it on 26 Aug 57, about 8:00 pm over Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin."
