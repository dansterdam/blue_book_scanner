Four-legged object
From the Johannesburg Star of July 22, the information that Mr. F. M Perrish of Elsburg, Germiston, has reported seeing a strange object on July 21, at home, he watched it for some time. The object was described as being about four feet long, as reddish in colour but seemed to change to green. It moved up and down and then darted sideways and at one stage two blue lights appeared to approach it and later disappeared.
Mr. Perrish thought at first it might be some kind of 'spies or legs below it. It moved faster than any aircraft he had previously seen.
