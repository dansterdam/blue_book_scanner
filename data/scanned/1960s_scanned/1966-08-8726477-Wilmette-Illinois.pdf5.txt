Beloungy Sighting

Page 4

August 3, 1966

and that she attributed the motion to the airplane she was watching (this was during the investigation). Neither witness had been aware of the effect of the screen, and both agreed that the appearance of distant lights through the screen was closely similar to the first object seen the previous night.

Three second objects seen by Meyer, however, were probably the cluster of planets that is now prominent in the morning sky. Jupiter, Venus, and Mars are very close together, and at this writing (August 4) are drawing closer. The direction is obviously correct, since Jupiter never departs far from the ecliptic, and as CCIS the sun was reported as being right where the objects had been, therefore, they were on the ecliptic. The tripling of the objects was undoubtedly due to the extreme angle of view through the screen, which would greatly increase the distortion effect horizontally while not changing it appreciably in the vertical direction.

Mrs. Beloungy was impressed by the great brightness of the objects on the second sighting. By implication, therefore, the first object was much dimmer than the brightest of the three objects, Venus. Capella has a magnitude of +1, and is indeed fainter than Venus, but is still very bright as stars go.

We may conclude with considerable assurance that the sighting involved astronomical objects only.
