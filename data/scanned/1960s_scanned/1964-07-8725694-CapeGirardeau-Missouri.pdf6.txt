REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

On 11 November 1964, a report was received through official channels concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object near Cape Girardeau, Missouri. 

At approximately 9:10 P.M., Mr. Frank Kimble, a resident of Cape Girardeau, reported that he had observed a luminous object in the sky while driving home from work. The object, which he described as being about 30-40 feet in diameter, was hovering at an altitude of approximately 500 feet. 

Mr. Kimble stated that the object emitted a pulsating glow and appeared to have some type of lighting system on its underside. He further reported that the object suddenly shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view.

An investigation was immediately initiated by this office. Statements were obtained from Mr. Kimble and two other witnesses who corroborated his account of the incident.

Further inquiries are being conducted to determine the nature and origin of the unidentified flying object. A complete report will be submitted upon conclusion of the investigation.
