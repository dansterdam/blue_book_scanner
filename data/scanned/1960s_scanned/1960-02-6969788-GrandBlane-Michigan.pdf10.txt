Mr. R. E. Niemeyer, President. U.F.O.R.C.
Dear President Niemeyer:
As I have had the only information from my area, 
the first case at Orland over to the U.F.O.R.C., I feel that I 
should give you the details of this case, as we understand 
it here, for your information.
The first case at Orland was reported to us by a Mr. 
Claude Shenefelt, a resident of Orland, who stated that on 
the morning of January 31, 1960, at approximately 6:50 a.m., 
he observed what he described as a lighted object, of 
disc-shaped or saucer-like configuration, hovering or
suspended in the sky above his home. This object was
estimated to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was
described as being illuminated from within, the light being 
of a bright, bluish-white color. Mr. Shenefelt stated that 
the object hovered in the sky for a period of about 5 to 7 
minutes, then suddenly accelerated at a terrific rate of 
speed and disappeared from sight. 
This is supposed to be the first proper report.
Since I can see no picture of this object, I believe this
does answer your request for details.  
Respectfully,
[Signature]
