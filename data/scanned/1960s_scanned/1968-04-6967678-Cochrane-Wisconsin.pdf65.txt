Dear Hector:

I am sorry to have been so long in replying to your letter of 14 May, concerning the UFO sighting of April 3, 1968, by a Mrs. Cochrane, Wisconsin. I have been out of the country and, on my return, found myself swamped with so many things that I couldn't really give the report the attention it deserves until now. However, I have read and re-read the report and have some fairly definite ideas, some of which were not mentioned in any of the reports or correspondence. Some of the questions I would like to have had answers will probably be answers will be obtained.

Considerable emphasis is placed at the very beginning on the car passing Mrs. Cochrane at high speed and, apparently, disappearing into the distance. Yet she seems to think it was just ahead. In my opinion her impression of its putting out lights or losing its lights was caused when the car went over a distant rise. It was going at high speed and nothing in her original report indicates that it slowed down because she was afraid she might run into it is perhaps just her own illusion. She does not wear glasses, but I should really like to know what her true correction is.

It is perfectly clear that she did not know what direction she was traveling in. She said northeast, but the map clearly indicates that the direction was northwest. This fact that she was traveling in the wrong direction but thought she was going northeast is perhaps the most significant thing in the whole story.
