Dear Mr. ****,

Your letter of April 27 addressed to a Lt Colonel coming under this office has been referred to this office for action.

Almost eight letters you direct our attention to a sighting of an unknown object in your community on the night of April 25. This flight is of extreme interest to the Armed Services. The incident was reported to the Air Force by you, and an investigation was made by an Air Force representative. This report has been received, and we are greatly interested in the details and data you have provided. A preliminary analysis indicates that the object was of an atmospheric or terrestrial nature.

In the vicinity of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, on April 27, there were several reports of unidentified flying objects. The Air Force immediately dispatched aircraft to investigate. The pilots observed flashing lights in the sky which appeared to be aircraft. However, upon closer examination, the objects proved to be an illusion or atmospheric phenomenon. The pilots were unable to identify or intercept the objects.

Will also record to an apparent unexplained sighting in your locality. This office greatly appreciates your interest and cooperation in reporting such occurrences. We will continue our analysis and evaluation of the data and information you have provided.

Sincerely yours,
Frederick C. Durant III
Secretary
