Dear Mr. and Mrs. Blank,

This replies to your recent correspondence of May 25, 1967 in which you reported information on your unidentified sighting of October 25, 1966.

Unfortunately, you did not bring your sighting to our attention until February 28, 1967. The delay in reporting your observation prevented a timely investigation, since air activity records are normally destroyed within six months.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified object, please contact the UFO Investigator at McGuire AFB, New Jersey, or Capt. Thomas J. Murnane, extension 4925.

Your observation has the flight characteristics of the Goodyear airship. Similar phenomena are associated with the Goodyear Company in the Northeastern United States and are usually attributed to one of their sightings. On October 30, 1966 one "Mip" was in California, and the other was enroute from Mason, Georgia to Daytona Beach, Florida.

A check of the records did not reveal any additional sightings on October 30, 1966 from the Cherry Hill, New Jersey area.

Sincerely,

BARRET B. YOUNG
