DETAILED REPORT ON INCIDENT INVESTIGATING REPORT #7981023
LOCATION: PARSIPPANY, NEW JERSEY
DATE: NOVEMBER 6, 1967

Narrative: On November 6, 1967, at approximately 10:25 PM, local police received a call reporting an unidentified flying object over Parsippany, New Jersey. Several officers were dispatched to investigate. One officer, William Johnson, was able to obtain a series of photographs of the object before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.

The photographs show a lenticular-shaped craft with a bright glow underneath, hovering silently in the night sky. No other details of the craft's structure or operation were observed. The object's flight path and manner of departure suggest a high-performance, highly maneuverable vehicle of unknown origin.

Investigation into this incident is ongoing. The photographs and witness statements have been carefully analyzed, but no definitive conclusions have been reached regarding the nature and origin of the observed phenomenon.
