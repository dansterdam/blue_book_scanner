Include questions or considerations of your own which you think merits attention: Dark [illegible] looking out the sky. We noticed a bright object in the sky very briefly was darting around very quickly. We could not get a good view of it because it moved so fast. We called it to the attention of the officers and they said [illegible] to further investigate it. It was there for such a short period of time we could not get a good look at it compare.

(2) But the object was act so something not of this earth. We think it is possible it could have been an U.F.O. but we can't say for sure.

(4) If you tell me what it was.
