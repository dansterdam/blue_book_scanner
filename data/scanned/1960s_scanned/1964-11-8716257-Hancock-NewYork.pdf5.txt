"A4
There is something that took place that evening in this town that was unusual and may have been a sign of something more serious. The object seen was low flying and showed a bright red glow. The object was over a cornfield and could not be identified. No sound was heard and the object did not display any flashing lights or other normal aircraft markings. The object remained in view for several minutes and then disappeared straight up at a high rate of speed. It is difficult to explain what this object was and it should be investigated further."
