The image contains a sketch or diagram, but does not appear to contain any photographic elements. The text below the diagram asks the viewer to "Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an 'X' at the beginning of the path, and an 'O' at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course."

Transcribing the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Trace on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "X" on the compass to show how the object was moving. Place an "FB" on the compass to show you first saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, and an "O" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Radar apparently was trying to track an aerial object, and this report document is instructing the witness to provide additional details about the object's trajectory and movement.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
