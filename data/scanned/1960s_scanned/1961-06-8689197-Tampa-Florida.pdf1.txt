7. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING  
Object observed as source of a/c lights on course of 100 degrees at an altitude very high, with a steady white light picked up on ground radar. The witnesses were convinced the object was a scheduled a/c which it could have been. However, they could not identify it as such. The a/c lights were extremely bright and rapid, and the object appeared slightly oval-shaped. Radar tracked the object at around 30,000 ft. altitude.
