LOCAL SIGHTING 
AIRRON, OHIO 8/16-17/63  
11:52PM - Miss Becky Dozer and Bruce Doger, sister & brother, observed an object in the sky which was described as being as "large as a star" and changing color rapidly from green to violet to blue, to white, the occasional appearance of a reddish color was also seen. The object was tracked from the time it appeared at 11:52PM until it finally disap- peared about 2:30AM EDT. The color charges were rather rapid, continuing to cycle through their color spectrum. The object did not appear to be rotating, but re- ceiving colors upon it dynamically. The object appeared to be stabilize through its ac- tion, not drifting appreciably. No airplane or satellite identification could be made and the object appeared to many times the size of a star, yet it was difficult to judge its actual size and distance. The planets, Jupiter & Saturn, were pointed out to the observers but they stated the object did not resemble either of these in any way. The object appeared to move in the following manner: Dia- metrically to the observer's position, the object would grow larger, then smaller, then disappear and reappear in a slightly different position, continuously, be- coming a longer shape with each repetition. Additionally, an occasional brightening would occur. This rhythmic change in shape and color was continuous over the sighting period. 

The observer stated its distance was apparently about the size of a pencil held at arm's length.
