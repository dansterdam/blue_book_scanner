Text from the document:

Dear Sargent Jacobs,

I have received your letter concerning the case concerning the UFO incident which was submitted by me, and forwarded to your office.  I am very pleased that the Air Force has taken an interest in this matter, and is investigating it thoroughly.  As you may know, Mr. Frank Parrella, who is the man who originally reported the incident, is quite anxious to learn the results of the Air Force investigation.  He was quite upset that the incident received so little coverage at the time, and was hoping that the Air Force would give it the attention it deserves.  I can assure you that Mr. Parrella and his family are completely reliable and responsible individuals, and are in no way prone to fantasies or delusions.  I am confident that the information they have provided is accurate, and I hope that the Air Force will be able to determine the true nature of the object they observed.  Please let me know if there is anything further I can do to assist in this investigation.  I would be most interested in learning the Air Force's conclusions.

Sincerely,
