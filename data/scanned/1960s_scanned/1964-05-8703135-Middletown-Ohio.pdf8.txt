The image contains a sketch with instructions and a compass-like diagram. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine being at a specific point and provide directions for placing markings on the diagram to indicate the position and trajectory of an observed object. There is no photograph present in this image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
