There does not appear to be any photograph in this document. However, I will proceed to extract the text from the image:

The first landing call was to the Lansing Police Department, where I spoke with Sgt. Ruse/Snyder. A series of calls had been received from residents of Southern Lansing for several days, starting at 3 AM on Wednesday morning, May 20. A list of names was obtained from the log of Wednesday, all from people who complained of a "whirling" noise. This noise was described approximately as a "whirring" noise, starting low and going high, then stopping. In a subsequent call to the Eaton County Sheriff's office, I was informed that at 3:44 Wednesday morning a police car had made an emergency run down Miller street, employing a new "warbling" siren, which the desk/sergeant described as sounding "weird."

When I read him the list of addresses of the complainants, he identified most but not all, of them as being close to the route of the emergency run.

The men met subsequently, while ______ was acting in his capacity of television announcer (for WILX) at a remote broadcast from a restaurant (____) in Lansing, and here they each learned that the other had seen the light. Unfortunately, it appears that they have already compared their stories, as both reported to me in phone calls Saturday morning that...
