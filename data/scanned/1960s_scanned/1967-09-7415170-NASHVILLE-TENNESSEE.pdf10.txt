The image contains a handwritten sketch that depicts the movement and shape of an unidentified object observed. The sketch shows a wavy or zigzag trajectory, and the observer has labeled it as "Object's travel." There are no human faces or identifiable individuals in this image.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It traveled until it was out of sight.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) Yes No Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) Yes No Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of: 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - no sound
b. Color - red orange

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Almost the entire area of the object

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
