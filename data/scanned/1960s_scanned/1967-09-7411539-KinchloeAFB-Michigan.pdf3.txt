MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subject: UFO on Radar
Lt. Leaman of Kincheio called Lt. Marano regarding the RADAR sightings. They did not scramble aircraft because they do not have the capability. This must come out of Hq 29th Air Division at Duluth Minnesota. Fed the information and why they didn't scramble Lt Leaman did not know.
The B-52 did not see anything and was not playing with the radar. The Sergeant who was on radar duty said that if the B-52 was playing with the radar he could have gotten on a different channel and not had the problem. He tried all channels and was getting the same results. The other radar, 753rd at SS Marie had one strobe at 0500Z, 250 deg tracking. SS Marie did not see anything on scope. Their scopes are monitored by Duluth. Duluth picked up the strobe. The name in Duluth is "Blue Bottle". The Minneapolis Center FAA at Farmington, Minn was negative. Only the 753rd picked up one strobe.
