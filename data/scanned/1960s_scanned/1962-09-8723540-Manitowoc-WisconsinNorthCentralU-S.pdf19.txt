The image does not contain any photographs, but rather two sketches or diagrams. The first sketch shows a curved line that represents the horizon (skyline) and a "A" marking the point where the observer was standing. The sketch illustrates how high the observed object was above the horizon.

The second, larger sketch shows a person standing on a road in a hilly landscape. There are two additional smaller sketches, one showing a closer view of the hills and another showing a more distant view of the landscape.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketches as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
