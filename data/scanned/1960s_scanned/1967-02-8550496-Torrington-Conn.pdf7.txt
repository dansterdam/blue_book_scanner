Dear Major Quintilia,

In Feb.,1967, I sent a report of a UFO sighting (Feb.1,1967) to your office.In return, I received a FRSP from LC 14 w/envelope which I failed out to the best of my ability and returned. Since then, I have received no word as to what I viewed.If you have such information, would it be possible to send me said information?Thank you for any information you can send.

Sincerely yours,
