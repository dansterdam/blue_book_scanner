SKY OBJECT STRIKES BUILDING, CAUSES FIRE
10 a.m., an object described by witnesses as round, about 15 inches long and blue in color, struck a warehouse in Belfast, Maine and exploded. 
The building belonging to the Maple Leaf Dairy Company suffered minor damage from a fire which broke out and was quickly extinguished. It was reported small pink and white clouds followed the explosion.
People in the area reported hearing a high-pitched sound prior to the occurrence. No traces of the mysterious object were found on the nearby ground. 
Mr. floyd G. brittwater, Director of Defense for Knox County, investigated the incident. He stated the high radiation reading registered on the instrument was not enough to indicate contamination from an object from space (for initialing a meteor). The general consensus was that the object was not an ordinary space object.
