PROJECT 10273 RECORD
2. LOCATION: Burney, California
10. CONCLUSION: Probable (AIRGRAD)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observe reported a glowing white object traveling toward the observer. The object was visible for about 10 minutes before slowly disappeared in the west. The object had height finder radar radar. The radar then reported back: The object disappeared and did not return.
COMMENTS: There seems to be no reason why the observation could not have been of a small airborne object. A small plane on VFR would probably have had a failed light pipe with the small plane visible with the 250 knote and would explain why the object was not returned by the radar.
