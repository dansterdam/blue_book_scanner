The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document, possibly a report or notes from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

"It is this, simply, that added shock
to what seemed ordinary of what he might have expected, etc. It was during the fall of that year that I returned to take up other forms of work than those which I had had before. The shock I had experienced lay back of the mind, in a sense, during the intervening years and was not to be recovered or brought back again until now. I cannot say what caused it now, but it was no doubt precipitated by something I saw or read or heard. In any case, it suddenly re-emerged and the effect of reliving the experience was far more intense than I could have anticipated. I found myself impelled to go again over the terrain of that episode in search of details and meanings I had not before grasped or appreciated. I could not get it out of my mind. I was compelled, as it were, to retrace the steps of the earlier occurrence, to restate the questions that troubled me then, to see if any light could now be shed upon them. It was thus that I came to write this report. Not that I expect others to find as much significance in it as I do, or to share the feelings it evokes in me. But perhaps it may have some value in contributing to the general pool of experience and speculation on this difficult and puzzling subject. And perhaps, too, it may be of some small help in my own effort to understand. In any case, this is a faithful account of what happened, just as I remember it."
