There is no photograph or image present in this page of the UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains only text, which I will transcribe below:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound ______________________________________________
b. Color _______________________________________________

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
b. Sharply outlined 
c. Don't remember
e. Other _____________________________________________

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
