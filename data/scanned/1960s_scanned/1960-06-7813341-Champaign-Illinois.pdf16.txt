1. The attached film has been analyzed and the following conclusions reached:
a. If the data accompanying the photography is true and correct, some very intense light source moved through the camera's field of view in 14 seconds. The intensity of the light source is indicated by the fact that it is entirely visible when within 8 degrees of the sun.
b. The information given regarding camera tilt is verified by the sun angle at the stated time of photography.
2. Image motion during exposure precludes any analysis of object configuration.
3. The photography and exposure data give no clue as to size, speed or distance of the object, however, the camera's field of view indicates that if the object was moving in a horizontal plane its velocity was approximately one mile per hour for the entire 14 foot of altitude above the camera station, i.e. 500 mph at 5000 feet.
4. If the photography is fake, it was probably accomplished by a double exposure in which a light source was moved across the camera's field of view at a uniform velocity.
