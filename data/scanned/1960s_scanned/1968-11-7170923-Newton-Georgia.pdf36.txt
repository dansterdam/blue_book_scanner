H And check the times too. See whether the times agree, more or less.
J Yes. One thing that to me is kind of interesting is that, the fact that Apollo 8 just came back from the Moon and I feel that out of all this vast universe of ours, we have a small sun, actually, compared to other stars, the earth is a small planet compared to some other planets, and all that kind of compare, so why we should we be so special self-centered, 
Dr. Hynek, to think that maybe we're the only intelligent creatures in the world.
H Well, I think most astronomers would feel that we are not. That the probabilities are very, very high that we are by no means, the only ones. The problem, of course, we see no way in which these intelligenseseas could get here. But then, when we realize that in the last 100 years we've come from covered wagons to Apollo spacecraft, other civilizations may be millions of years ahead of us.
J Well, that's the question that I have. Who's to say that maybe we're the furtherest advanced of any creatures, some planets out there in another solar system of something. Maybe they've completed some way of traveling in time without suffering the aging process or something. Now this is something that I've read in some articles, I think, this may have been in your article, but who's to say how far other planets have advanced.
H Well, that's a very, very strong possibility, and I think as an astronomer, most astronomers would simply agree that there's no reason whatsoever for our thinking that we are the most advanced.
J Have you every by chance, run into a book called Interrupted Journey?
H Oh, yes.
J That is most interesting, isn't it?
