The image contains a form with questions related to a UFO sighting. There is a drawing space in the bottom half of the form where the witness is instructed to draw a sketch of the object they observed. The text indicates that the witness should label the sketch with details about the object's shape, size, and movement.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show any trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
