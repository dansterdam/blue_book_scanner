There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text instructing how to handle and report UFO sightings.

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 299-2. Refer to it if you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn in this form with your old report in the normal.

One final note. Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the CAC. Ext 493. Reports are much more easily investigated at the time of the sightings than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help the Air Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.
