In the night of Thursday, 25th
July, 1962 several sightings came
in from the Stratford-on-Avon area and are recorded here with acknowledgments
to the Stratford-on-Avon UPO
Group.
Observers in the Birmingham area describe that there was seen to turn on a bright lightwithrwhich is illuminated the
interior of the aircraft. It
climbed at a fantastic speed and
vanished into the night sky. Fifteen 
witnesses saw this and describe ten objects.
Mr. Dunn and Mr. Cope of
Stratford-on-Avon, who first
reported the sight, describe it as a "big beaming
searchlight" climbing up and up.
The object changed colour from a red to a
white colour of the object, which was
variable toweards the end. It
made a stoppage and then
vanished. It is said that these
casual reports came from several
directions and disappeared in
various directions.
At 11.15 p.m. Mr. B. Wheele-
house reported a bright light which
was coming from the direction of
Evesham. The object was
descending at Wellesbourne and was
seen again at this same location.
Mr. R. Jordan of Alveston,
said that he actually saw it
coming down towards him and it
looked "bigger than a full moon"
which drew his attention
to a very bright light which was
seen from the balcony Terrace of
the Theatre. The light, which
was very bright, appeared to be the
height of a car headlamp and had
two small rays of lights beneath
forming a "V" shape. At 11.20 p.m.
This was at 11:20 p.m. A few
moments later a directed beam of
light came from the object, and
watching very carefully, the object
was seen to move, gaining height and
speed. It was travelling in a
S.W. Direction, when we noticed
it carried a green light on one side
and a reddish-orange light on the other.
