Text extracted from the document:

5. Location of Observer: See attached sketch. Gapehcart Hotel, Tyndall AFB, Florida

6. Identifying information on observer: Military - MSgt, HQ 73 Air Division, duty title, NCO.

7. Weather and Wind: According to Base Weather Station, the weather was clear and visibility was 10 miles. A full moon was visible until 0600 hours.

8. Additional Remarks: From years of experience in observing UFO's, I have discovered the present effect of the object, this was due to the sun rising and the moon setting, for a radar effect on the UFO. I have also made an evaluation and comparison of previous UFO's seen and I have come to the conclusion that it is a new space vehicle.

Another thing that made me look to the sky that morning was that my TV set was acting up, with plenty of interference. I have discovered two UFOS coming outside when my TV set acts up because of outside interference. They were about two to three times the size of an automobile and lasted only about 1 to 1.5 seconds. On both occasions, 1960 and 1945, when a thunderstorm is moving toward Tyndall AFB, you can tell, the observed craft TV signals drop out. Texas, Louisiana, I do believe are caused by sun spots or unknown other interference. When this occurs, I always check the sky, for UFO's.

This report was prepared by MSgt, information contained herein is true to the best of his knowledge. Its has studied this UFO and believes it might be a new space vehicle, basing this on his past experience in tracking other and Echo.
