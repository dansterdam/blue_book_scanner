The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, dated October 11, 1966, regarding an unusual sighting reported to the project by a Mr. [redacted] in Columbus, Ohio.

The text in the document is as follows:

OCT 11 1966

Dear Mr. [redacted],

We have consulted our Project Blue Book investigative office concerning the unusual sighting you reported to us in your letter of September 15th. They have advised us that nothing quite like this has been previously reported.

On the date that your outdoor dog barked would seem to rule out the dog's attention having been attracted by a sound (possibly beyond the range of human hearing).

I am enclosing some literature and a sighting report form. We should like you to fill out this form, so that we will be able to examine this phenomenon. But, should you wish to make any further comments, you are at liberty to do so. Your identity should, of course, be kept confidential if you submit a report.

Thank you for your interest and cooperation.

Sincerely,
GEORGE E. FREEMAN, JR.
