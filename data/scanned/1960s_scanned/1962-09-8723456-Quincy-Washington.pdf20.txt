DATE - 22/9/1952
Our Crop (?) was flying a object a little over a half an our. We were at the base of the Cascade Mountains on the eastern slope, at a point about 3 miles south of the town of Quincy, Washington. The object appeared to be a discallite at a distance and had a glowing light all around it, only slightly brighter than the glow. The object appeared to be at an altitude of about 1,000 feet and was moving slowly at about 30 mph. The object finally disappeared from sight slowly in a northerly direction.
