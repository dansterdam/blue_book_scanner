The text of the letter is as follows:

Reference your letter of 4 September 1963. We do try to notify sighting observers possible. However, because the large number of reports and our limited staff, it is not always possible to do so. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
