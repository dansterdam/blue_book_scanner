REPORT OF ANALYSIS OF THE CASE OF
August 15, 1968, YELLOW SPRINGS, OHIO

I am not the least bit happy with either the interview or with Hynek's evaluation. In the first place, the time of moon rise, given by Hynek, is approximately correct. These are, I take it, all Eastern Daylight Time.

I have nearly always found that when some observer says "It looked like X," but it couldn't have been, because X, "the reasons for the 'because' are usually invalid."

Now for specifics. Hynek says that there was an inconsistency in the time, a moment to approximately an hour. This would have been worth while following up, but he does not go to the origin of the discrepancy. Who was the second person, and did Ardene really remember correctly? Did

Green item starts talking about "the man and this other object." Apparently he is already conditioned to the belief that a second object was involved, because his whole questioning appears to be predicated on this hypothesis. Apparently the reason that he questions the lunar identification is his inability to understand how the object could have had the reported motion.

There were two reported motions, one a spinning or rotatory effect and the second a following or chasing the moon. With reference to the second, as one is driving along, seeing the moon apparently following him. I remember, as a child, getting this sensation when I was traveling in a train or an automobile.

This case clearly exemplifies one of my major criticisms of the Air Force Questionnaire. I mentioned this more than a year ago when I sent in my suggested revisions. I want to know what the conditions are of Ardene's eyes. Is she myopic? Does she wear glasses ordinarily?
