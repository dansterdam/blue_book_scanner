The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with text describing a sighting in Gouve, Brazil on about 22 August 1962.

The text in the document is as follows:

BRAZIL - GOUV'E: The R.J. "o Junior Jornal" on 23-8-62 reported, "On 22 August, at about 19:10 hours, a bright light was observed by the populace of Gouv'e, a town in the interior of Rio de Janeiro State. The incident lasted several minutes. The light was also observed at a distance of 30 km, at the locality of Vargem, and was also seen by several people in Teresopolis. In Brazil, similar incidents are not unusual. There have been several previous occurrences in the general area. The witness' reports are incompetent, but there is no doubt that the phenomena was observed."
