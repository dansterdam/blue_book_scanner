Vn June 7, 1961 a frail 64 year old woman, Mrs. Ethel Hass, living at 11-44 31st Avenue, Astoria, New York, reported seeingwhat she believed to be a UFO during the afternoon at approximately 2:15 PM. 

Mrs. Hass stated that she was standing on the front lawn of her home when she noticed a strange object in the sky to the west of her location. The object appeared to be cigar-shaped and was hovering approximately 2,000 feet in the air. Mrs. Hass estimated the object to be about 50 feet in length.

According to Mrs. Hass, the object remained stationary for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from sight at a high rate of speed. Mrs. Hass stated that the object made no sound and did not leave any visible trails or markings in the sky.

Mrs. Hass immediately contacted the local police department to report the sighting. The police in turn notified the Air Force authorities at Mitchell Air Force Base, who then dispatched investigators to interview Mrs. Hass and inspect the area.

The investigators reported that Mrs. Hass appeared to be a credible witness and that her description of the object was consistent with other UFO sightings logged by Project Blue Book. However, no physical evidence or corroborating witnesses were found to substantiate Mrs. Hass' account.
