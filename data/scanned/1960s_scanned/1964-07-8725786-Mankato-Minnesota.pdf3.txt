SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING, 10 JUL 64, MANKATO, MINNESOTA

1. Ref your SAFOI PD (File CDS-22) ACBM-69.

Reference the attached letter from Major Jared, USAF, which observed the unidentified object on 10 Jul 64. The following is a suggested reply:

Your interest in having this case investigated by the Air Force for reply. The satellite-like object observed on 10 Jul 64 at approximately 2230Z hours was eventually identified as a re-entry of space debris from a previous satellite or missile. It is noted that the magnitude and general configuration of the object as observed was larger than other objects of known identity. This condition is frequently encountered and gives rise to misidentification, particularly at night.

We regret that we cannot offer a more concrete explanation.
