Dear Sir:
I am attempting to give you the details of my story. There were 2 large groups of lights that came to me on July 12. They were lights of 2 different colors, and more than once they came near to me - this is not the first time they have done this sort of thing.
This is a 15 year old boy.
Sincerely, 16.
