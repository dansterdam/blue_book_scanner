TV Newsman Snaps UFO Photos

On the morning of 5 August 1965, a TV newsman, Charles A. Macomber, was taking pictures of his home in Bells, Texas, near a police broadcasting antenna. His attention was drawn to an unconventional aerial object because of its unusual behavior. He photographed the object for approximately 7 minutes. 

According to the Texas State Police, the only part of the conversation he could monitor was that the object, a blue-white light, was south of Durant, he took his 42 speed Graphic pictures. McCullum, the TV newsman, also gave a slightly different description, stating that the object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter, was turning or rotating, and was at an elevation of 45 degrees in the northeast.  The photographs on black and white film show a fairly slow, erratic flight at 3 minute intervals. The object appeared to accelerate and make a very rapid, steep climb.

After watching about 2 1/2 hours, during which the object appeared to hover, the witness, Macomber, left the area, went home and told the story to neighbors, who were also watching the object. Campbell and McCullum were 2 miles west of Bells, Oklahoma, watching from Durant, 30 miles south of Bells, and a Department of Public Safety officer was watching from a point 5 miles south of the location where the object was first sighted.

The interesting point in this sighting is the number of witnesses as well as the duration of the sighting and what the object looked like on film. Campell said the object appeared to be spherical in shape with well-defined edges.
