MRS. HART STATED THAT AS SHE WAS LOOKING OUT HER LIVING ROOM WINDOW FACING WEST, SHE SAW A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTHWEST AREA. SHE CALLED IT TO THE ATTENTION OF HER HUSBAND AND THEY WATCHED IT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. THE OBJECT CAME CLOSER AND THEN APPEARED TO HOVER IN ONE SPOT FOR A FEW MINUTES. IT THEN MOVED RAPIDLY STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. SHE STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ROUND OR OVAL-SHAPED AND MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE STARS IN THE SKY. IT ALSO SEEMED TO BE SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET IN THE AIR.

BOTH COMPLAINANTS STATED THAT AT 10 P.M. DURING THE INCIDENT, THEY CALLED SEVERAL FRIENDS WHO ALSO OBSERVED THE UFO. THESE FRIENDS WERE NOT IDENTIFIED.

THE COMPLAINANT CALLED SEVERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AGENCIES IN AN EFFORT TO GET CONFIRMATION OF OTHER REPORTS ON THE SAME OBJECT, BUT SHE WAS TOLD THAT NO OTHER REPORTS HAD BEEN RECEIVED.
