COMMENTS: Witness (name redacted) when called notified that this case very similar to an observation from Lebanon, Ohio on 26 April 1961 in which 5 witnesses saw an object at an extreme distance, at an altitude of approximately 75 to 80 degrees, which appeared to be approaching very slowly. At that time, the object remained stationary for approximately 90 minutes before descending vertically behind some trees. The sighting recorded here is quite similar and would appear to involve the same or a similar object.
