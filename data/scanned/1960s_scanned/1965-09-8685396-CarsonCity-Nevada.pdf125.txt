The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with text describing a UFO sighting.

A. According to the text, on 13 July 1965, the balloon CASS 9 located at approximately 45,000 feet over Carson City, Nevada, was tracked by ground radar. The object was described as being circular in shape, approximately 100 feet in diameter, and it was drifting toward Woodlawn at that time. The object could have contained a small balloon inside it, but this could not be determined.

B. Records maintained by the 746th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron indicate that on 31 July 1965, at approximately 10,000 feet altitude, an unidentified object was picked up on radar. The object was traveling at an estimated speed of 600 knots and was maneuvering erratically. After approximately 10 minutes, the object disappeared from the radar.

C. On 6 August 1952, two witnesses in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, interviewed regarding any UFOs they might have observed between 21 July and 6 August 1952. The witnesses stated that they did not observe anything unusual during that time period.
