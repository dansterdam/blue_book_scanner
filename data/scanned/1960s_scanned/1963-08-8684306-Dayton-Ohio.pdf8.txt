There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from what seems to be a Project Blue Book document, containing a questionnaire with questions 34 and 35 visible.

34. Did you complete this questionnaire?
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:
