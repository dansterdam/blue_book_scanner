Flying Headlights

A number of people who have seen the bright lights of flying saucers actually make the mistake of referring to them as "flying headlights." They say the lights were similar to a car's headlights, except that no car body was visible. In many cases, what they saw were simply disc-shaped craft showing only their lights, with no visible structural details. Because these craft show little or no outline, and because their lights are so intense, they do seem very much like large headlights in the night sky. Those who have seen this type of UFO describe the lights as being round, oval, or slightly elongated, usually two in number, and sometimes blinking on and off. The size of the lights reportedly ranges from just a few feet across to as much as 30 or 40 feet in diameter. The lights are said to be so brilliant that they light up the entire surrounding area.
