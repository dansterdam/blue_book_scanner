27. INFORMATION WHICH FEELS A FEAR PERIMETER, BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

I'll be careful to only output the text found in the document and not make any other comments or observations.

I went around the 4 stair case and saw the object about 250 yards distant. My wife stayed in the house with my son and daughter. The object looked as if there was a hole in the top. & It didn't pay any attention to the telephone poles and electrical wires and seen on the ground 30 minutes or better. After about 30 minutes it began to move away up and went around about 4 stair case and went or appeared to went straight up and disappeared. At this time it was the others and my wife & I saw the object, and my wife and I first noticed it was the others and said we did a very closely examination it at 7:03 P.M. I went and grabbed my binoculars which I looked thru and focused very good. The object seemed to be at about 60 feet high and about 40 feet in diameter, round or cap-shaped. It made no sound and there were no flashing lights or beams of light coming from the object. The color was a bright metallic like aluminum. The object just sat there stationary for about 30 minutes and then began to slowly move up and away, gained speed and disappeared straight up.
