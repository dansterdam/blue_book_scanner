This was a very strange and perplexing incident. The object was sighted at a distance of about one mile away from our location, which was near the Granville gate on the north end of the airport. The object was round in shape, silver in color, and slightly larger than a car. It seemed to hover and maneuver silently for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and completely disappeared from sight. I did not hear any sound associated with the object. This was something I had never seen before, and it did not resemble any conventional aircraft or other known object. The incident left me and the other witnesses very confused and unsure of what we had actually observed.
