In answer to your request for written information on the sighting of an unidentified flying object:
On the night of August 6, 1962 at hours 2025 in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, my attention was directed to an unobstructed view of the horizon. I observed a brilliant light in the sky travelling at an extremely high rate of speed from east to west. Its course was approximately 45 degrees from the horizon. The light, round in shape, seemed to suddenly disappear behind a cloud cover. At no time was any sound associated with the object heard. The sighting lasted approximately 5-10 seconds.
