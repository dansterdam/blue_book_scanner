34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   February 1927
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
Nothing else I can say. This questionnaire was answered as thoroughly as possible. I have related all the details I can recall and made notes of the experience. Unfortunately, much was unnoticed and unforgettable. I have told all I know about this phenomenon including listen to those who wanted to talk to me about it.
Thank you,
