The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report or document, containing a series of questions related to the observation of a UFO or unidentified flying object.

Performing OCR on the text in the image:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the match stick would have been covered by the object?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as you saw.
