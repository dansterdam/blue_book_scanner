CLEARWATER, FLA. 
In the afternoon of 7-8-64, the writer and his wife were
driving on Route 19 south of Clearwater, Fla., when they
noticed a bright object in the sky. It appeared to be hovering
and was quite bright. They stopped the car to observe it more
closely. The object remained stationary for several minutes,
then moved slowly in a southwesterly direction, making a
slight upward movement. It then increased in speed and
disappeared from view. The object was observed for about
10 minutes. It was a bright, silvery-white in color and appeared
to be circular in shape. The writer stated that it was definitely
not a satellite, airplane, or any other known type of object.
