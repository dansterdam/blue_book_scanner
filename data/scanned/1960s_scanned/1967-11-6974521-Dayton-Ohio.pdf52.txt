The image contains two sketches or illustrations. The first is a compass-like diagram with directional labels, instructions, and a notation indicating "PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN." The second illustration shows two landscape sketches, one with a flat horizon and one with a curved horizon.

"SO. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE.  PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN.  PLACE A 'Y' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN."

"IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A 'Y' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.  CONNECT THE 'X' AND 'Y' WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON.  IF THE PHENOMENON STOPPED, MOVED ERRATICALLY, OR CHANGED IN ELEVATION, INDICATE THIS BY NOTES WITH THE SKETCH."
