Langley Team Investigating
UFO, But Report Unlikely

Washington, Jan. 7 - The Air Force Office of Special Investigations is now responsible for investigative the phenomena of "unidentified flying objects" (UFOs), Project Blue Book was discontinued last year.
This was disclosed to newsmen Saturday by Project Blue Book Director Maj. Hector Quintanilla. The colonel said that the AFOSI had assumed responsibility for UFO investigations about two weeks ago.
Project Blue Book was the Air Force's official agency for recording and analyzing UFO sightings and reports. It was discontinued on Dec. 17, 1969, after about 22 years of operation.
Quintanilla said Monday the closing action came after a review of the volume of sightings which had decreased in recent years. He said about 12,000 cases had been investigated by Project Blue Book in the almost 22 years of its existence.
The spokesman said there had been a gradual decrease in the number of sightings in the last few years and "a number of cases that were just plain hoaxes." He claimed the validity of many of the reports was in question.
Quintanilla said that Langley Air Force Base in Virginia is now handling the investigations of UFO sightings and reports. He said the AFOSI has assumed this responsibility and will conduct the probes as part of its overall security mission.
He added that any "hard evidence" such as parts of a UFO or unusual materials would be turned over to the Air Force's Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio for analysis.
As for the possibility of releasing official Air Force files on UFO investigations to the public, Quintanilla said "there are no plans" for such action. He said the files would be available only to authorized government agencies under the Freedom of Information Act.
