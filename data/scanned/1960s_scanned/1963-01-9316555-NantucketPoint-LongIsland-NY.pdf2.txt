Dear Bob,

Everything is fine with the flying saucers. Have made one TDY trip to southwestern with Capt Quintanilla regarding UFO's.
A committee of three graduate students has been formed at Northwestern to investigate 1963 sightings. In some way we might come up with some area where the Air Force falls short either in investigations or evaluations.
I have enclosed some of the cases from Jan 1963 where there is some differences in opinion as to the cause of the sightings. Perhaps a note from you might enlighten us. Now I will see if your pupil learns this lesson (that's me).
Played a team game with Dan as partner and John Dooley as opponents; we managed to finish 3rd. Believe claims Dooley kicked six benders. I was busy scoring and didn't get a chance to score.
I am working at Sears' three nights a week, so the budget is confined to Sunday games.
Saw Jacoby in the Cincinnati regional; he sends his regards.

Hope everything is going well for you and the family. Give my regards to June.

Sincerely,
