A brilliant light in the sky, like a searchlight, moving across the sky not more than 1000 ft high, but the light had no beam or cone of light coming from it, the light itself traveled across the sky, would become very bright and then dull, green like a glowing star. The only noise was a slight hum as it passed overhead, it would make sudden stops and changes in direction, one time it seemed to shoot straight up and disappear out of sight.
