Craig: Moving in that direction, Dave?
Well, up and down, maybe it was moving a little back out towards the right.
How big did it look to you?
Well, at first glance it looked to be maybe 50 feet long, or something like that. But it could have been real small, the distance was indistinct.
But it did look like a big object, about 50 feet across?
Yes, sir.
You crossed this fence before you took the picture?
Yes, Sir, because these trees were in the way.
Were the trees in the way when you crossed that opening, or the fence?
Well, I don't know why I didn't take the picture up there. I guess because it had moved up why, I lost it, you know.
You wanted to get on this side of the fence so that you would have a clear shot of the object to take the picture?
I guess the reason was, the reason.
Where did you cross the fence, David?
Up there at the gate.
I came across at the wooden gate. Did you run up here to this spot, you speak up, or what?
I sorta stumbled up.
You sorta stumbled up, O.K. Could you tell me some of your thoughts that were going through your mind when you saw this? You were UFO hunting, so think this was a UFO?
Well, after maybe a minute or so it sort of calmed down a little bit, and that's when I thought, "So that is a UFO." So I had my camera wrapped around my belly and I thought, "well, I'd better take off my camera" and I thought this, I pulled out the film and put it in my camera, and I was still going pretty slow, because I was real nervous, and I was pulling out the film and getting the camera and then I pulled out the film and set it down, and then I heard my friend coming and someone call out and I said to him, "Did you see that?" and he said, "No, I missed it." And then I heard my friend coming back some time later.
