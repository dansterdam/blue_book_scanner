34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

At Laredo, Texas, a fireball from N.G.C.B., at Beath East. They would see a storx, the brightest that ever seen. They did not tell me the type of object but it was the same type of material that they had seen before. Mrs. K. G. B. said it was getting brighter (she was in bed). The star again shown here was a bit of the object was seen (about the same size).

Sincerely
