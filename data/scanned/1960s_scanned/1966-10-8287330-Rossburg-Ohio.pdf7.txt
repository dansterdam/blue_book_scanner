The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and an instruction to draw a picture. The diagram shows a curved line with angles marked, as well as a compass rose. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine a scenario where they are observing an object in the sky, and to indicate on the diagram how high the object was above the horizon and where it was seen on the compass. The second part of the instructions asks the viewer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects.

Text extracted from the image:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
