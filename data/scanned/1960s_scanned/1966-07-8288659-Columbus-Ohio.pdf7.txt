The image does not contain a photograph, but rather includes a sketch and a compass diagram. The sketch appears to depict the motion of an object or objects, and the instructions ask the viewer to draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. The compass diagram is likely included to aid in describing the direction of the motion.

Text extracted from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
