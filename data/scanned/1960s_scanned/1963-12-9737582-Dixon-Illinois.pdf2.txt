CLOSE ENCOUNTER AT DIXON, ILLINOIS
ON 9 DECEMBER 1963

At about 9:15 P.M., on the evening of 9 December 1963, Mr. Joseph Cooper, a businessman living in Dixon, Illinois, sighted an unusual aerial object near his home. Mr. Cooper reported that the object was a bright, metallic, disc-shaped object which hovered for several minutes over a nearby field before moving rapidly away to the northeast.

After the initial sighting, Mr. Cooper went inside his home and called the local police station to report the incident. The Dixon police dispatcher, Mr. James Smith, took the call and attempted to verify the sighting. However, by the time the police arrived on the scene, the object had disappeared from view.

Later that evening, Mr. Cooper and several other local residents reported seeing the object again as it returned to the Dixon area. This time, the object was observed to be maneuvering at a high rate of speed, making abrupt changes in direction, before finally accelerating and disappearing from sight.

The case was subsequently investigated by the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, the official government program tasked with investigating unidentified flying object (UFO) reports. The investigation concluded that Mr. Cooper's sighting was a genuine close encounter with an unidentified aerial phenomenon.
