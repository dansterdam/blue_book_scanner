There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely a UFO report.

Please allow me to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and transcribe the text from the document:

"I allow stand watched while in service and I could tell aircraft from Redington and others without aircraft. The U.F.O. sighting was inside at the backyard and nothing else was seen except.

I will be willing to answer any questions which pertain.

Please let me know when would be of any assistance."

The document appears to be signed at the bottom, though the signature is not entirely legible.
