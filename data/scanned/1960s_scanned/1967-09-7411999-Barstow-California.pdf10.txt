10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA:
At the time of the sightings, genuine radar tracking data showing the movement of the objects was not obtained. The observers saw a saucer-shaped object which apparently had white and blue-white lights. When the lights were observed, the object was 35-40 degrees above the horizon. No physical evidence was found. The observers were requested to return to this office, but none ever returned. The flight path and maneuver of the object was not determined.
CONCLUSION CONT'D: The observers were requested to return to this office, but none ever returned. The flight path and maneuvers of the object were not determined. (TDI)
