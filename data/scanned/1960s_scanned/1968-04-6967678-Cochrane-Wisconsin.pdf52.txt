Here is the text that I have extracted from the image:

Let tha - 18

quarter that night - I looked it up - and it would have been in back of you, so that's - I was trying to catch you on that one, a little bit. But now, let me see. Somebody said it was foggy that night. Is that right?
M    Not too, not too much. At that time of the year it isn't too much. 
H    Let me see. Could you see the stars?
M    No, one or two by the moon.
H    OK. Alright, then, can I talk to your mother again?
M    OK
H    Thanks very much Mark.
L    Hellow
H    Yes, well, enjoyed talking to _____. He apparently got quite scared.
L    Yes. He didn't say much; in fact when I got home I tried to help him have him help me piece the story together and he couldn't - he just didn't want to talk about anything. He just seemed to huddle up in his bed and that was about it. He was ten at the time.
H    Well, what do you think of this whole experience now, now that a year or so has gone by. 
L    Well, I'll tell you once I got in my house I stayed there and I wouldn't even go outside for a long time at night.
H    Uh huh. Now, what sort of treatment have you had from people that you have talked to about it. Do they - How about at school?
L    Well, my kids of course, are real interested, but I didn't say anything when they told me not to at first, and then after that they were real anxious interested, and after I had had this experience, then came out this Weekly Reader with a UFO in it. They were really interested then.
