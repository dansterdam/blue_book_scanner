There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document containing text only.

TEXT OUTPUT:

250 ft- The position of the object was given as 20 degrees elevation, 350 degrees azimuth, disappearance was listed on the same heading but no reliable information was reported. No under investigation object.

We had hoped that the photograph would reveal an identifiable image. However, photo analysis revealed that the image on the print is not the same as the object observed by you.

The evaluation information is desirable for analysis of the visual observation: (1) Local map of the area and the location (direction and distance) of the object in relation to a point of reference, and bearing and elevation of the object in flight in relation to the motion of your car and the direction and elevation of the horizon, (2) any information pertaining to the description of the object in changes, in size, shape, and color.

If there is a delay in asking for this information and hope that some additional data can assist in further identification of the image.

The Air Force wishes to take this opportunity to thank you for your interest in unidentified flying objects and your reported observation.
