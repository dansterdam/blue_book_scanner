Dear Major Coleman:

As you requested, on 4 June 1961, I sent you information regarding a sighting of an unidentified flying object over Rushville, Nebraska early in January 1961. [Redacted] approached the sighting, and advised that the sighting was still unidentified as of 25 April 1962.

Would you please send me a copy of the latest DOD News Release on the subject?

On 7 August 1961, I requested information regarding two CHICAGO-area sightings: 1) 7 June 1961, Richmond Heights, Ill.; 2) Have been trying to obtain information about these incidents for over a year. If I can get the details, I would like to ask your opinions on the cases.

On 11 September 1961, I requested information regarding a series of UFO reports (28 Aug 57) San Clemente, C hile. I would like to know the official conclusions in this case, in accordance with AFR 200-2.

Major, I have a considerable amount of patience and I feel you are competent and quite helpful. I hope you will provide the information I have requested.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
