Although this sighting occurred on the 23rd, it was not reported until a few days later. As he did not notify any authorities until then, there is no official record of the incident. He received the call at 2130, 26 Sept. The boys were aged 10 and 15 according to the caller, who thought it was a matter that required a report. After questioning the caller, it was decided that the object was probably an unusual reflection of light, the minimum size estimated as about 30-40 feet across, and the maximum height estimated as above 5000-6000 feet. No photos were taken and no physical evidence of any kind was obtained. The duration was from 10-20 minutes.
