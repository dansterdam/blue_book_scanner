The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a letter from the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, which was an investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

SAF-OICC/Miss Turner*/76525/Mar. 1, 1963
MAR 7 - 1963

Dear Sirs:

This is a reply to your letter of March 5, 1963, in which you stated that you had observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) that you desired to have investigated.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate it further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Community Relations Division
Office of Information
