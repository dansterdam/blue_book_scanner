The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document related to Project Blue Book.

Text transcribed from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
I see the cloud and then it disappeared. I saw it like the cloud it was very low and it disappeared just like the cloud does.

15. Did the object move behind anything, particularly a cloud?
I don't know. If moved behind, I can't tell.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know If you answered YES, describe what was in front of it:
It could just disappear, like a cloud.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None, that we could hear.
b. Color: Looked like grayish or yellowish or fog-like color.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and tell how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
I just saw the cloud, did not measure it.

19. Draw a sketch to show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch such things as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or glows on some parts. Indicate the direction the object was moving.
