Dear Sir:

On Sunday, 9 August, 1964, while trawelling north on U.S. Highway 99 just north of Selma, California, my sister called my attention to an object hovering in the sky. It appeared to be at about 10,000 feet. The object was cylindrical in shape, definitely metallic, and seemed to be rotating as I observed it for about 10 minutes. There was no visible means of propulsion. The object appeared about twice the size of a B-52 bomber.

I thought about the object and its strange characteristics. It was a while and cylindrical, and continued to be hovering, and appeared to be rotate as I observed it.

Your truly,
Signature
