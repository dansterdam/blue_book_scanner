This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be handwritten text, possibly from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

The text reads:

"Several cars seem to be about at the same time, they apparently made no noise. There was no dust or disturbance of any kind.

There was no light, no vapor trail or anything to indicate the first about half a minute after I saw the object it seemed to disappear completely. This might of course, be only an illusion.

Incidentally, the intensity of the light was sufficient to allow me to glance off of toward the north, but I felt no heat or warmth whatsoever.

The object had been a stark white about as big as a softball and was motionless, remaining at about 30 degrees altitude all the way. I lost sight of them then after about a half minute. I happened to glance at my wrist watch and saw that he next exposure shot showed the strange lights and followed the first one quite rapidly. I watched them until they had gone."
