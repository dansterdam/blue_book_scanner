The image does not appear to contain any photograph. It seems to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

The text reads as follows:

NO, NO it was just a light, in a particular spot. It didn't project a beam or anything.

And how close to the horizon did it seem? 

Well, it was directly in front of us at our same altitude; in fact, it was at an identical altitude and he was doing aerobatics. He would go straight up and then over the top and straight down to maybe 300-1000 feet below us, below our altitude, and then he would return to our altitude. He did this several times, and I have seen jet practice, military practice, and this is right on I assumed this was what it was, but the fact that, of course it was night. I was on an instrument flight plan, and it irritated me because Jacksonville Center had not warned me of this traffic. And so I called them and I said: "Have you got traffic at our twelve o'clock position?" And he said, "Negative." And I thought, out on that side of the state, there radar reception is a little bad, and I've been through that before there before, and so I fly on for, oh, I'd say, five minutes or so, and the fellow in the front seat with me there is also a pilot...

Mr. [REDACTED], yes. And I hit him and I said, "Boy, I don't know how in the world those fellows do that at night." See, we were over the water at that time, with no visual ground reference. And, of course, you know, you tumble your instruments after a certain altitude. So, both of us are there watching it.
