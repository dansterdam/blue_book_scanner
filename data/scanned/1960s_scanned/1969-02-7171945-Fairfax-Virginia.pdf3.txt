ON FEBRUARY 7, 1969 ABOUT 9:00 PM RAYMOND W. OVEN AND A COLLEAGUE, STEVEN J. HANSON, WERE DRIVING NORTH ON ROUTE 66 IN FAIRFAX COUNTY, VA. NEAR THE ANNANDALE EXIT. WE OBSERVED A BRIGHT STATIONARY LIGHT APPROXIMATELY 30 TO 40 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON NEARLY DIRECTLY AHEAD OF US. THE LIGHT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 5 TO 10 MILES DISTANT. IT APPEARED TO BE ROUND IN SHAPE AND APPROXIMATELY 1 1/2 TIMES THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF THE FULL MOON. THE LIGHT HAD A PULSATING OR FLASHING QUALITY, ALTERNATING BETWEEN A VERY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT AND A DIMMER REDDISH-ORANGE LIGHT AT A RATE OF ABOUT 1 PULSE PER SECOND. THE LIGHT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MOVING. AFTER OBSERVING THE LIGHT FOR 2 TO 3 MINUTES, IT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED. NO SOUND WAS HEARD DURING THE OBSERVATION.

WHEN AND TO WHOM DO YOU REPORT THAT YOU HAD SIGHTED THIS PHENOMENON?
