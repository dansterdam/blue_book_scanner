1. The witnesses reports have been submitted in letter form as requested. There have been numerous instances of people coming into this office in person via second-hand and were chased away as crank calls. There was no classical work using borrowed stenographers. There were sightlings and the witnesses seem, especially in the case of the writer, to he quite verbal.

2. The article from the local paper indicates the coverage given there of the incidents. The story as written in the press has a couple of variations from that told this office as possible reason, as they passed the news along to the home office in Washington. They died out approximately 5 minutes as they maneuvered, and the writer seems quite excited, and the local relative humidity was standing at 97% on a warm, muggy night.
