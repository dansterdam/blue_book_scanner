The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text visible. As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

"They did not believe that the objects observed were bright stars, planets, or satellites, and thus to them they were unidentified aerial objects. They were of the opinion that whatever they observed was an actual object maneuvering above the terrain and not due to the movement of stars, planets, etc. They were most impressed at the time in observing this phenomenon and we were unable to explain satisfactorily what they had seen."
