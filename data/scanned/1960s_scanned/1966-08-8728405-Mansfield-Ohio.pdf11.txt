Radio station KDAL was uncooperative, but WCCO (Channel 6) offered to send films of interviews with witnesses from the night of the 15th; the offer was accepted. The Duluth Herald looked up stories, and found several the name of was thus obtained, and a report was obtained from his sister, who was also a witness.
