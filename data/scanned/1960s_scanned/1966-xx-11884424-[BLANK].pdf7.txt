MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: Implementing SAB Ad Hoc Committee on Project Blue Book Recommendations

1. The following personnel met at 1400 on 19 April in Room 2C1052 to discuss how to implement the recommendations made by the Ad Hoc Committee to review Project Blue Book.
Dr. Jesse Orlansky, AFRSA
COL ROBERT HIPPLER, AFRSA

2. On 5 April 1966, Secretary of the Air Force Harold Brown, in a memorandum to the Chief of Staff, stated that the Committee's recommendations should be accepted and arrangements made for the scientific team to investigate in depth certain selected sightings of UFOs. (General Depugeau was given responsibility for implementing the Committee's recommendations and Lt Colonel Hippler is project officer.

3. Although the Committee's recommendation was clear and succinct, initially there was no unanimous agreement on how to put this recommendation into effect. A basic question is:
(1) Should the contract or university or individuals connected with a university? A great deal of the existing was discussions with these facets of the problem and a clear answer did not evolve. Therefore, it is probable that the Committee may be asked to meet with Colonel Hippler again.

Generally, the contract or university (or individuals from universities) is good. Specifically, however, there needs to be a list of university to coordinate and evaluate investigations. After some discussion, it was suggested that the University of Dayton is probably most appropriate because it is located close to HQ USAF who will retain management of Project Blue Book. Other universities were considered that could provide program or technical assistance.
