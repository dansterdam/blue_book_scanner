Thinking back after the incident it seems rather incredible that the object I saw could not have been something like a meteorite or some other natural phenomenon. The object appeared to be 50 to 75 feet in diameter, circular in shape and definitely not a shooting star or meteor. It appeared to be hovering over a desert area near the foothills and seemed to be illuminated from the inside out. The intensity of the light was not blinding but rather a soft glowing light. The object remained stationary for several minutes then suddenly shot off towards the east at an incredible speed, climbing at about a 45 degree angle. The speed at which it accelerated was unbelievable. I watched it for several seconds as it disappeared from sight. This was definitely not an aircraft of any kind that I am familiar with. I would appreciate any information you could provide regarding the nature of the object I saw.
