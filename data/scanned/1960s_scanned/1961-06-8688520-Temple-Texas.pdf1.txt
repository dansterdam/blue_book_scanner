The image does not contain any photographs, only a Project 10073 record card with various fields filled out, including date, location, observation details, and a "SMC" stamp at the bottom.

    The witness reports seeing a white, circular object similar to a star but larger and brighter, which was observed for 1-2 minutes. The object was 12210 ft. the size of the quarter held at arm's length. There is a possibility of an explanation involving the misidentification of a known astronomical object.
