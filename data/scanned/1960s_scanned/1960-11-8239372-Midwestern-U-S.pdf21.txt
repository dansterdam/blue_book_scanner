On 5-10-60 at approximately 10:00 PM CST, an unidentified flying object was sighted in the sky near Harrisville, Indiana. The object was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes. It was described as being round, about 30-35 feet in diameter, and was a bright yellowish-white in color. It appeared to be rotating and descended at a 15-20 degree angle. The object was reported to have made no sound. The observer, [REDACTED], reported that the object hovered for a few minutes and then rapidly increased in speed and elevation before disappearing from view. [REDACTED] stated that the object appeared to be under intelligent control. Weather conditions at the time were clear and the visibility was good. No unusual meteorological or astronomical activity was reported for that date and location. The Air Force conducted an investigation but was unable to identify the nature of the object.
