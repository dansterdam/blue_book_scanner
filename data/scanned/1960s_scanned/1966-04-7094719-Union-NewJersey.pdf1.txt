Witness was flying down on the ground looking through a pair of binoculars when they saw an object that was shooting past at about 120 mph. It was a brightly colored object with colors green, yellow, and real bright orange. Five minutes later witnesses saw an object with a bright orange outline and a yellow inside. Information in letter quite sketchy, therefore, forms sent to witnesses.
