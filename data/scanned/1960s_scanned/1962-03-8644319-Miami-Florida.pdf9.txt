Dear Professor Hynek,

I feel that it is first necessary to identify myself as an amateur astronomer who saw the object, or objects over the South Florida coast on January 25, 1962. This is the second time on March 6, 1962.

I am very sorry that I am so late in sending this report. I have been working on a Science Fair project on Astronomy, and have been so involved with this project that it has delayed this report.

I wish to comment on this report, for I photographed the objects on the occasion with my telescope on my Science Fair project.

I will proceed with the report first in outline form:

1. First Observation
A. Date: January 25, 1962
