Casssville, Wisconsin 11-8-1961
Dear Mr. Bloecher:
This is in regards to the report that your office asked me to investigate regarding the sighting of the 'saucer' on November 1, 1961. The weather at the time of the sighting was clear and the object was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes. It was described as being round or saucer-shaped and emitting a bright light from the underside. The object was thought to be approximately 18,000-20,000 feet in altitude and an estimated 35-40 feet in diameter. There were no sounds reported as coming from the object.  

The report indicates that several people in the area were able to clearly observe the object but few details on the activities of the individuals observing were obtained. The sighting seems to be a typical sighting of an unidentified aerial object. I have no further information that would shed additional light on this incident. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
