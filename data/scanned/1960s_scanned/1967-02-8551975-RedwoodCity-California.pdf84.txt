Diagram: Here is a very general sketch of a flying saucer type craft that I saw. It was disc shape with a dome on top, hovered over the trees briefly, and then shot off at a very high speed. The craft appeared to be metal in color, but did not reflect light. It made no noise. I was quite surprised by what I saw.
