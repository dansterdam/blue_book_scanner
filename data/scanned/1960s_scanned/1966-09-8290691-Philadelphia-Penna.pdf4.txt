Our office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from the Philadelphia area on 24 September 1966 at approximately 2035 hours. The object was observed for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. The object was described as a silver elliptical object with
fixed navigation lights. If you have knowledge of such an aircraft
being operated in the Philadelphia area, please provide this information to us as soon as possible, as we are investigating an advertising gimmick which appears to indicate that some individuals in the Philadelphia area who have been issued banner towing authorizations by the FAA.
