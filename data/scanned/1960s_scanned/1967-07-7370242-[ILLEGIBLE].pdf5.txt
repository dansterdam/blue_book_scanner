To August 12 19 52 I saw up position at about 1:30 am out of me windows, a bright light that moved up a path and it was stationary and then it moved back down a path, it was light and round and seem to be my curtaining day. I just that was very unusual and my attention on it. It was very bright and plain to see and it moved very quickly up and down a path be. My curtain was open and it was plain to see. I don't know what it was but it was very unusual and I have never seen anything like it before. It stayed there for quite awhile. Then it disappeared. That's all I can say about it. I never reported it to anyone. I don't know if anyone else saw it or not. But it was very plain to me.
