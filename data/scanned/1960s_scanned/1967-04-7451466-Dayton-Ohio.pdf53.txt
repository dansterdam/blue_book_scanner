The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram with instructions for observers to follow. The diagram includes a horizon line, an object in the sky, and a compass rose. The instructions ask the observer to imagine the object's position relative to the horizon and to mark its location on the compass.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curves' line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
