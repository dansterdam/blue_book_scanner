Eugene Gwinn, Capt. of fireman
Washtngton, D.C.
Serial: 08-6-62
SUBJECT: Sighting of a Unidentified Flying object on Saturday, 6 Oct 62.
While on routine patrol duty, I observed a lighted object approximately 1000 ft. above the ground which appeared to be moving in a westerly direction at a speed estimated to be approximately 200 mph. The object was observed for approximately two minutes before disappearing behind a hill.
Description of Object:
The object was about 40 to 50 ft. in diameter and appeared to be circular in shape. It emitted a bright glow and was easily visible in the night sky. There were no wings, tails, or other appendages visible and no sound was noted. The object maintained a steady speed and altitude throughout the sighting.
I observed this particular sighting on two previous occasions, once in June, and once in August of this year. On both occasions the object was observed under similar circumstances and exhibited the same general characteristics as described above.
