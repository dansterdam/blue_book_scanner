The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch depicts a horizon with an object or objects in the sky, and includes annotations providing instructions for the viewer to imagine the scene and draw related sketches.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the horizon high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the horizon to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
