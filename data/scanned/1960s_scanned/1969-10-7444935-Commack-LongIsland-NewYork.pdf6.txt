Gentlemen:

On Sunday, October 26, 1969, at approximately 7:15 P.M., my wife and I were in Commack, L.I., N.Y., in the area of Village Hill Drive. This is a sparsely populated residential area.

We saw an object in the sky that was hovering above a large tree. Suddenly the object started moving at a rapid pace. As the object moved, the bright lights seemed to be revolving and the blue lights seemed to be revolving around one another, while the green light was stationary. It appeared to be much larger than a passenger plane. The flying object did not have any sound. It was silent and moved at a fantastic speed.

The object increased altitude suddenly. It did not move like a jet. It went straight up and was out of sight in a matter of seconds.

We are reporting this sighting because we feel we saw an unidentified flying object.

If you need any additional information do not hesitate to contact us.

Very truly yours,
