The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a handwritten document or report. I will proceed to perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

Theres a certain point of the -the reason,- first showed how serious of some ene in the sky, it was only a small object, hovering about 25-30 ft. high, and coming closer. it seemed to be turning real slow, and then got smaller and smaller and went straight up out of sight. it was a clear evening and the object was seen very clearly. i am very anxious to have some recognition of same for clomirians account. 
This information is of any value to whom it may concern, com tacts with same.
Vary truly yours
