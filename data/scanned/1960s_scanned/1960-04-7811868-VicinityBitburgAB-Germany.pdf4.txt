(The text of the document is as follows:)

On the night of 1 April 1960 at approximately 9:45 PM the writer received a telephone call from a Mr. XXXXX who reside at XXXXX in Raleigh, North Carolina. Mr. XXXXX stated that approximately 30 minutes prior to his call he had observed a bright red light in the sky which was moving rapidly from west to east. He described the light as being quite bright and larger than a star. The light was observed for about 2 or 3 minutes before it disappeared from view. 

Mr. XXXXX stated that the light did not appear to be a conventional aircraft and he was unable to identify what it might have been. He was quite concerned and excited about the observation and wanted to report it.

The writer thanked Mr. XXXXX for his report and advised him that the information would be forwarded to the proper authorities. No further action was taken on this report.
