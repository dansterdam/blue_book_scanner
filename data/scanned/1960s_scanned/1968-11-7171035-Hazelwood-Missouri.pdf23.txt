The image contains a compass rose diagram and two sketches. The compass rose diagram is labeled with cardinal directions and provides instructions for indicating the direction of an observed phenomenon. The two sketches appear to depict a person observing a landscape from a distance, with the landscape shown from two different perspectives.

"NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 'B' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'A' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A 'B' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE 'A' AND 'B' WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. ONCE COMPLETED, CAREFULLY STUDY THE MAP AND DETERMINE THE APPROXIMATE DISTANCE AND DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT'S MOVEMENT. ENTER THIS INFORMATION IN THE LARGER SKETCH."
