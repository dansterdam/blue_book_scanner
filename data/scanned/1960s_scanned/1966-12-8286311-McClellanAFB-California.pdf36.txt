SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED LIGHT OBJECTS

OFFICER IN CHARGE, AISO DETACHMENT
MCCLELLAN AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA 95652

This report will be forwarded in respective P.I.R. as it was dalled in on 17 December 1966. The case, if., was investigated as UFO 16702-66. 

On 8 February 1967, it was visited by 2nd Lt J. KURIS, AISO Det, McClellan AFB, who discussed a sighting made by DR. XXXX XXXXXX and the subsequent investigations.

On 19 December 1966, DR. XXXX XXXXXX was driving north along U.S. route 99, approximstely 2 miles south of Los Banos, California, when suddenly a bright light from somewhere off the road attracted his attention. He turned to observe it and saw an unusual bright light source hovering about 50 feet above the ground. He observed it for approximately 5 minutes. The light appeared to be spinning or rotating at a very high rate of speed. It was described as brightly illuminated, bluish-white in color and about the size of a large automobile headlight. 

No automobile headlights, streetlights, airplanes, or any other obvious light sources were observed in the immediate area. The object was silent and appeared to be suspended in the air. DR. XXXX XXXXXX stated that he could not determine whether it was from the ground or at a low altitude in the air. The object then suddenly and without sound or warning disappeared. The duration of the sighting was approximately 5 minutes.

In January 1967, DR. XXXX XXXXXX returned to the area to try to pinpoint the location of the sighting, but could not determine the exact spot where the object had been observed. This discrepancy could be attributed to the darkness of the area and the distance from the road where the object was located.
