The image contains a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page does not contain a photograph, but rather a detailed description of a sphere-like object observed in the sky. The text describes the object as having a red-colored emission distinctly separated from the main sphere, extending upwards at an angle of 45 degrees. The report also mentions the initial observers being awakened by a bright light shining in their eyes, and provides details about the observed size, sound, and movement of the object.
