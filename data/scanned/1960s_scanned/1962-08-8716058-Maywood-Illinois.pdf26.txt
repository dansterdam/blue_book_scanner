"No Case (Information Only)

August 1962
Chesterfield, England

The source vie father on 6-24-62
reported the following incident: On 5-30-62
at 7:30 a.m. his family sighted a luminous or glowing object at a high altitude traveling at very high speed to the south-east. The object was in sight for 3-4 minutes and was described as round, metallic in appearance, and emitting no sound. The family also sighted the object with a telescope and it appeared to be similar in shape to a dirigible but was circular rather than elongated. The witness observed the object through 7 x 50 binoculars at first with the naked eye. No landing or other maneuvers were observed and the object merely disappeared from sight, traveling in a straight path and at a uniform speed. The witness estimate the size of the object to be approximately 100 ft. in diameter and the distance from the observer to be approximately 2-3 miles."
