UFO Observation, 2 December 1967

FAA CONTROL TOWER
DALLAS, MUNICIPAL Airport
DALLAS, TEXAS

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from a pilot on 2 December 1967 which occurred in the Dallas Municipal Airport area. The pilot attempted to photograph the object but before he could photograph the clouds, they had disappeared.

2. Was there any activity originating from your airfield that could have caused this sighting? Did anyone in the control tower see anything unusual and did anyone report a similar sighting to you on this day?

3. Thank you for your assistance on this matter.
