Dear Mr. [redacted],

With further reference to your letter of September 13, and the reply signed on October 2 by Colonel Bronitsky, we have received the following information from our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Without additional information, it is impossible, at this time, to offer an explanation as to what you saw. If you will complete the attached questionnaire and send it to us, the people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to perform an investigation and make an evaluation.

It is important for an individual to report his sighting as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force installation. Your case McDill AFB, Tampa, Florida. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a much better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

No other unidentified flying object reports for September were received from the State of Florida.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
