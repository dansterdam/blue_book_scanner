There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a page from a UFO report document with handwritten text.

Beginning OCR:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 17 MAR 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or narrative explanation of your sighting:

This only reason we noticed it, to my wife turned to me and said, "look" at the lights and she said down before by the neighbor's daughter, we had been watching for an hour and we were going to go visiting and any time anyone came went, we saw two very bright round lights in the northwest and they moved up and down and changed color to blueish green, and they disappeared for long periods of time and we failed to see them again for that night. The next morning we found another neighbor woman had seen the lights about a half an hour after we saw them and we have since found that several families in the area saw the lights, but what they were, we have not the least idea. We were hoping you might be able to tell us what they were. It must have been something, but we called the Sheriff's office and they did not know anything about it. A sighted Plane can be apparently an airplane, but this type did not come close enough for us to identify it as such. We have no other explanation to offer except that is how we saw them.
