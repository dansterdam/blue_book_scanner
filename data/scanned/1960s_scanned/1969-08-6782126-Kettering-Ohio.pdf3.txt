The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

A point of light.

what was the angular size? hold a match at arm's length in front of your known object, such as a street light. compare the size of the match head to the size of the object. this will give you an estimated angular size. how long was the observation from start to finish? if the phenomenon would have been covered by the match head, indicate that in the report.

would have been a star
