The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch appears to depict two different perspectives or views of an object in the sky. The larger sketch on the left shows a curved horizon line with a semi-circular object above it, while the smaller sketch on the right shows a circular, disc-shaped object.

Transcribed text from the document:

33. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
