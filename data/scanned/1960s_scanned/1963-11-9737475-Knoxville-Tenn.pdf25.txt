1. Reference the attached letter from (Deleted), dated 9 Dec 63, requesting information on a UFO sighting which occurred at Knoxville, Tenn., on 1 Nov 63, over Tennessee. The information given indicates that this sighting is obviously in error. Sightings by trained observers of this type are rarely made, and on occasion may even appear as a hoax. This does not, however, appear to be the case. The object which Mr. (Deleted) saw is apparently an astronomical phenomena known as satellite decay and may even appear as a hovering or slow moving light in the sky. This phenomenon has been observed by others and appears to be quite well known.

2. Satellite decay (or re-entry) is distinguished from meteors by:
a. The re-entry always has an easterly component.
b. The color band toward the trailing edge is muted and changes to a dark color spectrum as the object breaks up or decays.
c. The deceleration of satellite decay is much longer. Sputnik IV decay on 5 Sep 62 lasted in excess of two minutes and the brighter Vanguard IV was seen for six minutes at the same time with a final portion lasting two additional minutes.
d. The speed is much slower for satellite decay as compared to meteors or normal satellite passages.
