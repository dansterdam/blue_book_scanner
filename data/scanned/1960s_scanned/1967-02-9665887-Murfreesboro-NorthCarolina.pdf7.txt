The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a handwritten document or report. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will transcribe all the text found in the document:

"When the object at night,
as illustrated, was seen far away it was about the size of a full moon. The other
few stars that one could see at
the time. The object did seem to make
a sound that I could hardly describe. I believe
it was about 300 yards above the
horizon. It is impossible to give the
exact conditions or measurements or conditions or the other
factors involved. The object was a perfect
lighting up and get thought brighter
extremely bright, and not move it
all in appearance. I can't give very details on
it as I can compare it to anything
seen before. I have had experience
people with regard to my obectivity as
they know I do not go into extremes and make more
of things than there actuality is."
