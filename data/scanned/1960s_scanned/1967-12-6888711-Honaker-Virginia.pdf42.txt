There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a hand-drawn diagram and accompanying text.

Text from the document:

"IS WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THIS OBJECT? WHAT WAS ITS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT OR BUILDING? IF YOU CAN DETERMINE THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE FULL MOON'S APPARENT DIAMETER THIS OBJECT WOULD HAVE SUBTENDED.
