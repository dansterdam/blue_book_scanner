MEMO for the record: 24 Jan 67

Contact was made with Major J. J. O'Donnell, McGuire AFB, New Jersey, in response to a request that some UFO Police officer take several policemen into a large auditorium and tell them they were to report on anything out of the ordinary occurring. The only sighting that was investigated by McGuire on 11 Jan 1966 was from a civilian who reported seeing a white light maneuvering in the sky. Major O'Donnell said that he could not confirm that any sighting or report of an individual. All the information was taken over the phone, and Major O'Connell would not consent to having the name and address of the individual who made the report.

Contact was made with Lt. KING (ox-720) at Steward AFS, New York. He said that without a specific date he could not check the sighting. He would try to have a record of any reports he might have received.

Call made back to Lt. King with the correct date of the sighting. He was requested to check on any aircraft out of Steward that could have been in the vicinity. The policeman claim that after the Lt. O'Connell sighting 11 Jan 66, the sighting was lowered in to the area.

Major Harris called from Steward AFS in regards to the initial questions posed to Lt. King. Major Harris said that there were no reports of any aircraft from Steward and that he had checked the records and could find no account of the Jan 66 sighting being reported to the Air Force. He said the Oct 66 case was investigated by Steward.

Contact was made with Air Police at Willow Grove NAS, Pa. in regards to anyone from that base going to investigate in Jan 66. Conversation with Mr. George Albert, Chief Security Police, revealed that no one from Willow Grove was sent to investigate the sighting.
