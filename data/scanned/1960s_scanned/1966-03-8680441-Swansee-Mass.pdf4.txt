There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, which appears to be an old UFO report from Project Blue Book. 

The text in the document reads:

"Forty groufield cheepale just oveen ovens river into our town (Swansea) had some form of round object or vehicle come toward them for soe time. Could not describe it fully etc. Three boys say it was very bright like lights, in a kind of floating motion, and appear to sperat nfront of them again. Can this be verified?? The mere mention of the name of the boy might cause trouble. To save them any embarrassment, I will not include their names. I think this is a very strange occurrence, and I hope you will be able to investigate and see what can be done. Perhaps you could have someone contact me and I could give you more details. The boys were very upset by this experience, and I think it would be best if their names were not included."
