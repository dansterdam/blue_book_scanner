The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified aerial object. The image shows a detailed, intricate pattern of spikes or rays radiating outward from a central point, giving the object a star-like or burst-like appearance. The document caption states "This is the way the object appeared to the witness" and mentions "many, many stars also" being observed.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will extract the text from the document:

This is the way the object appeared to the witness. The object was bright and circular in shape. The witness, Virgil Schultz, stated that many, many stars also appeared around the object.
