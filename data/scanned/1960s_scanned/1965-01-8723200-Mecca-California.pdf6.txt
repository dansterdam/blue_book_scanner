Text from the document:

April 26, 1965

John F. Spaulding
Lt. Colonel, USAF

Dear Sir: 

In reference to your letter of April 13, 1965, there is always a reference to your letter dated April 13, 1965, wherein you request information concerning the matter of a sighting which was reported on or about April 5, 1965. This I may have forgotten to put on a return. However, this is your letter, and I am enclosing a reply to you in the matter.

In the past I have written many letters to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and I have on several occasions left their place without leaving any indication that I have talked to them about this particular flying saucer matter. However, I must inform you that I have contacted them to make the record complete, since in the future someone may have occasion to want the information which I can provide.

Office of Federal Bureau of Investigation
