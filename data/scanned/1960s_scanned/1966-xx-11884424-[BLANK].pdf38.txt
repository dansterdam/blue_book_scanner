Dr. Carl Sagan

Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138

Dear Dr. Sagan,

Are there the type of booklets that you are interested I receive these through the mail from a citizen in New and I have no use for the booklets so you may keep these you wish.

Sgt. Moody, who retired on 31 March 1966, received the attached booklet, "The Book of Space Ships in Their Relationship with the Earth", and requested that I forward it.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
