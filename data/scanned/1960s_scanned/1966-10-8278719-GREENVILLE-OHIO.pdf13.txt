There is no photograph present in this page of the Project Blue Book document. 

The text from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? WENT TO BACK OF IT AND STAYED THERE
15. Did the object move behind something or at any time, particularly a cloud? CIRCLE ONE: Yes No. IF you answered YES, it moved behind: BUT - I LINED IT UP WITH A TELEPHONE POLE SO IT MOVED VERY RAPIDLY DOWN OR LEFT TO RIGHT
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? CIRCLE ONE: Yes No
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound SILENT
b. Color BLUE - GRAY - SILHOUETTED
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment, what was the result? 1/2 OF THE MOON'S DIAMETER - COVERING IT UP TO THE NAKED EYE. ONE RESPECT MATCHES AND COVER NEARLY HALF OF THE OBVIOUS BRIGHT PORTION.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing the relative size of the object that you saw such as wings, protuberances, etc., and especially show the trail or wake or any evidence that the object was in motion. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. (various shapes drawn)
