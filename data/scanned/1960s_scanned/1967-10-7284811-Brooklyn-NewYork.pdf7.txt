Gentlemen:

The enclosed please find a picture and an negative of an Unidentified Flying Object. This picture was taken on October 7, 1967. I did not see the object Jack until it turned up in the print. I have used every method I know possible to identify it but could not. I hope this will convince you, please advise me.

Yours truly,

P.S. I have another picture of the same object but did not send it because this one might have got lost in the mail.
