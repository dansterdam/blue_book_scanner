There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This seems to be a page from a scanned document, specifically a Project Blue Book report.

Using optical character recognition (OCR), the text from the document can be extracted as follows:

h. ANY OTHER UNUSUAL ACTIVITY OR CONDITION, METEOROLOGICAL, ASTRONOMICAL, OR OTHER, WHICH MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGHTING:

(1) I am told that a rocket was launched at vandenberg AFB that night. I am positive that this sighting was not of a rocket or any component thereof nor was it a conventional aircraft or balloon.

2. INTERCEPTION OR IDENTIFICATION ACTION TAKEN (SUCH ACTION MAY BE TAKEN WHENEVER FEASIBLE, COMPLYING WITH EXISTING AIR DEFENSE DIRECTIVES):

(1) None. 

3. LOCATION OF ANY AIR TRAFFIC IN THE AREA AT TIME OF SIGHTING:

(1) I did not see any aircraft at that time although there were normally considerable civilian and military traffic in the area.

POSITION, TITLE AND COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

(1) Chief, Exploitation Branch, Directorate of Intelligence, HEADQUARTERS STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND (SAC) - Subject report was received by this headquarters on 28 September 1965, eighteen days after the sighting occurred. Our analysis of the report indicates the possibility that the sighting could have been caused by a ballistic missile reentry. However, the report does not contain sufficient information to establish this conclusively.
