communications is less than 20 years old.  In other words,
the time during which a civilization like ours is in a position
to communicate with other civilizations is infinitesimally short
in comparison with the duration of life on the planet, and age
of the stars.  
The next question is how long shall we have this ability to
communicate with other civilizations, that is, how long is our
civilization likely to endure?  The answer to this can be
based only on faith and temperament.  Shklovskiy thinks that
a civilization cannot last longer than 10,000 years for which
he is taken to task by his Soviet colleagues.  According to the
Communist conception our civilization, once reorganized by the
adherents of Marx and Lenin, will go on forever as all sources
of internal friction will be removed.  Therefore, the duration
of a civilization should be put down as 10⁹ rather than 10⁴ years. 
Western writers would tend to the longer time scale.  It is,
however, clear that the duration of a civilization is something
that cannot be decided a priori.  Our own civilization may be
said to be 6,000 years old, and whether it will survive for
another 4,000 years, or 400 years, or even 40 years is anybody's
guess.  Some thinkers, notably H.G. Wells and O. Spengler, were
very pessimistic in this respect.  It is well known that our
