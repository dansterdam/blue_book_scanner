UFO Sighting phoned in at 1300 on 12 June 1963
Time/Date of sighting: 2310 local, 12 June 1963
Location: West edge of Xenia (Lanewood Housing Development)
Observer: Xenia, Ohio
ASI 23177
Observer was lying on a chase lounge in the backyard of his home (facing toward the West) and looking straight up when he observed the object. At first it appeared to be a jet plane progressing to the right toward the position of three stars (the constellation Cygnus?) The object then began a series of oscillating movements, climbing progressively to the right toward the position of three stars. This climbing motion continued for about 15 to 20 seconds. About 15 to 20 flashes of blue-white light streamed out meteor and flashing seemed to be high in sky and moved at a rapid speed.
"Phenomenal" (no sound) could be seen, scattered clouds.
