The image appears to contain a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page includes a description of an investigation into a reported UFO sighting.

The text in the document states:

INVESTIGATION:
1. Corrections/Additions to Original Report:
a. Size was estimated to be 30-50 feet long.
b. Shape was oval with points at top and bottom, and each end lights were located. 
c. Color of main object was a brilliant white (difficult to change), occasionally changed to orange.
d. Lights on ends were blue and occasionally changed to green.
e. Distance from viewer when first noticed was estimated to be 1 mile.
f. Movement of object appeared to be to left and right, forward and backward.
g. Object disappeared after about one hour by what seemed to be a combination of a forward climbing flight path which resulted in a angle of approximately 45 degrees. Object traveled away from the viewer and the object appeared to break up in one or two parts which were bright lights and were described by the viewer as an explosion.
h. Object viewed through binoculars (7 x 50 power) and was seen by four other persons. No pictures were taken.
2. Weather Conditions:
Wellington weather records revealed that there was an extremely large inversion from 3000 to 5000 feet which was caused by an increase in temperature and a rapid decrease in moisture. This in itself was so strong it caused extensive false echoes on the weather radar. 
CONCLUSION:
The UFO was, in all probability, an optical illusion created by the reflection of lights from the ground off the inversion layer. The object was able to rise at the inversion layer rose when it was effected by the rising sun on the morning of May 8th, 1966 over the body of water (Galveston Bay) east of Houston.
