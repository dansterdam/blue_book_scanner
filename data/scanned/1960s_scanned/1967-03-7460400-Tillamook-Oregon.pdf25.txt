UFO Evaluation

1. From the data available it is not possible to positively affirm or refute the presence of a material object at the point from which the sighting was received.

2. It is the opinion of this office, however, that the rapid speed changes, the hovering characteristics of the return, the association of the irregular circular return, and which lighted observations all tend to indicate a typical "false" target (on the radar) due probably to temperature inversions which were present on both the 11th and 13th of March.  

3. If, in fact, the return existed at all, this office is of the opinion that it represented essentially a motionless target for 3 to 4 hours on several successive nights without sending an interceptor or so investigate. The uncancelled video echo for the most part apparently was not moving at any excessive speed, and was at attitudes from 8000 to 9000 ft. If this example, including military personnel, are convinced that there is a "metallic" target up there, surely sending up a plane to investigate would be in order. Apparently the visual sightings (as well) are NOT due to "metallic" targets but likely due to a "unidentified disturbances" will not convince many people.

4. In closing, if our analysis of this report is correct, it would appear that Dr. Condon and the Universe of Colorado Physics Department might provide a logical explanation of how these things happen.
