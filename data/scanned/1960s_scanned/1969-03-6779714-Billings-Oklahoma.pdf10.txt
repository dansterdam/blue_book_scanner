Text from the document:

"WHICH PART OF THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE WHEN FIRST SEEN? FIRST SIGHTING WAS ONLY OF THE LOWER PORTION, OR APPROXIMATELY THE BOTTOM QUARTER OF A SAUCER-SHAPED OBJECT. IT WAS ROTATING SLOWLY (APPROXIMATELY 5 R.P.M.) AND ASCENDING GRADUALLY FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO THE NORTHEAST. THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 SECONDS. WHEN IT DISAPPEARED, IT DID SO BY ASCENDING SMOOTHLY AND FADING FROM VIEW. THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECT. IT WAS A CLEAR, MOONLIGHT NIGHT, WITH EXCELLENT VISIBILITY.
LOCATION OF OBSERVER: BILLINGS, OKLAHOMA, APPROXIMATELY 7 MILES WEST OF THE CITY LIMITS. NO TREES OR OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY.
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: THE PORTION VISIBLE WAS A SAUCER-SHAPED OBJECT, WITH A DULL GRAY OR GUNMETAL COLOR. IT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 20-30 FEET IN DIAMETER.
CONCLUSIONS: THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS DEFINITELY NOT AN AIRCRAFT, SATELLITE, METEOR, OR ANY OTHER KNOWN TYPE OF AERIAL VEHICLE. IT MOVED IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH ANYTHING UNDER HUMAN CONTROL. THE OBSERVER IS A MATURE, RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUAL WITH CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN OBSERVING AIRCRAFT, AND IS COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT WHAT HE SAW WAS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY."
