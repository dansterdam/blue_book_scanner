The image appears to contain a form from Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects. The form includes a section where a witness can describe various characteristics of a UFO sighting, such as "Move in a straight line?", "Suddenly speed up and run away?", and "Change color". At the bottom of the form, there is a handwritten note stating "Appeared to be coming to see", and another note stating "Material clouds that seemed to be mounding".
