UFO SIGHTING, BEAUMONT, TEXAS
20 JULY 1961

The following is a re-recording of conversation 20 July 1961 between Trans Texas Airlines flight 110 and Beaumont Approach Control:

RUNWAY 112, WINDS CALM, INDICATING NORTHEAST, OVER FLYBY 2:38p.m. SOUTHWARD BOUND AIRCRAFT AT ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 30,000 FEET. THEY OBSERVED A BRILLIANT TYPE OF MILITARY INSTALLATION. ABOUT A MINUTE LATER AS THEY CONTINUED SOUTHWARD, THEY OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE SAME OBJECT, OR ONE SIMILAR TO IT, HOVERING AND STATIONARY, SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THEM. IT REMAINED SUCH FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT 2 MINUTES AND THEN SUDDENLY ZOOMED UPWARD AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. AIRCRAFT CONTINUED FLIGHT WITHOUT INCIDENT.

The text then goes on to describe the pilots' observations and reactions to the UFO sighting in detail.
