The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract and output the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
DECEMBER 5, 1963

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

FEEL CONFIDENT THAT SIGHTING WAS GENUINE.
ACCOUNTS OF UFO SIGHTINGS, FROM THE RIDICULOUS
TO THE SINCERE, HAVING OBSERVED MANY STARS, HUMAN
SIGHTINGS OF STARS, HAVE COME TO CONCLUSION THAT WHAT
WAS OBSERVED WAS NOT A STAR, BUT A SELF-LUMINOUS OBJECT
APPEARING TO THE NAKED EYE AND HAVING A RELATIVELY
FAMILIAR MOTION WITH THE SOLAR SYSTEM. BUT WHAT I
SAW DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE STAR SYSTEM, THAT WHAT I
SAW WAS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT AND WORTHY OF NOTE.
