There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

We would like to recommend that your class read the book "The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects" by E. J. Menzel and H. Whipple. Published by Doubleday, this book contains an authoritative treatise on the UFO phenomenon by Dr. Donald H. Menzel, Director of the Harvard College Observatory. It explains many of the particular phenomena accounts for each category of UFO appearance, so that we think this book will be most helpful.

Enclosed are several copies of the new Air Force Technical Report on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects. These too will be helpful for your class.

Sincerely,
