The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter dated November 1, 1966 from George P. Freeman Jr., Lt. Colonel, USAF, Chief, Civil Branch, Commander, Information Division, regarding a person's inquiry about an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation.

Text from the document:

Dear Mr. ___,

This is in reply to your letter of September 13 regarding your unidentified flying object sighting. Please excuse our delayed reply. The volume of correspondence has precluded a prompt reply to your inquiry.

We are unable to positively identify what you observed on September 13, 1966. There are no UFO reports from that date in the late Champlain area which could be correlated to the Project Blue Book Office.

I am enclosing UFO form 164 which is used in making UFO reports to the Air Force. If you would like to complete this form and return it, we will then attempt to analyze the information.

Thank you for your letter, your interest in our program is appreciated.

Sincerely,
GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Commander, Information Division
