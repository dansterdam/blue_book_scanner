The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on what appears to be a form or questionnaire. I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 20 MAY
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

A bright CIGAR shaped object with a whitish glow, about the size of a large plane, was sighted over the Nashua, New Hampshire area at approximately 9:10 PM on 4/20/64. The object appeared to be moving away from me and descending slightly. The object stopped and disappeared, and made no sound at all.
