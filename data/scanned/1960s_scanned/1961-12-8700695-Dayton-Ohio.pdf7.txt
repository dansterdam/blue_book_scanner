Sacramento, Calif.
Here's an unusual item from Sacramento, California, dated December 8, 1961: A weather-Air Force radar station a few miles outside Fairfield, California, had reportedly tracked a very large object moving rapidly across the Sacramento Valley from the southwest to the northeast. The object was tracked for a brief period by a sophisticated military radar system, but as it approached, the radar apparantly "lost" the object. The object was never seen visually, and apparently left no physical traces, but the radar operators were completely convinced of its reality. These reports led to the jet chase.
