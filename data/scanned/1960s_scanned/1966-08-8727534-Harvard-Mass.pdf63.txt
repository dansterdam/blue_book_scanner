The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely a page from a Project Blue Book report.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

As night set in, we saw the object disappearing, but it had a strange light, about the size of a basketball, and it would change colors from red to white to blue - very strange. It appeared about the size of a basketball about 5 or 6 miles away, and it was moving very slowly, almost stationary. I had a strange feeling about the object, and I don't know what it was. I tried to follow it with my car, but it just disappeared. I don't know what it was, but it was very strange and I have never seen anything like it before. They appeared about the size of an ordinary basketball, about 5 or 6 miles away, and they changed colors from red to white to blue, which was very strange. I don't know what they were, but they were not ordinary aircraft, and I have never seen anything like them before.
