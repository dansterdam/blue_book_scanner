The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten letter or document describing a UFO sighting.

I went in the house. I told my sister about what happened. She said maybe there were some aliens in it. They might have seen me pointing and turned out their lights. The next day I looked in the newspaper for any reports on the 10:05 object. I'm still thinking about the UFO. PLEASE file this in your files as a UFO report. If I see anymore UFOs, you'll be the first to know. Thanks for your time.
