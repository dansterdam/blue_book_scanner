I know what I seen with my own eyes, Retired school teacher. I have. Taught school at Middleport for over 20 years and am well known in the community. On April 7, 1967 at approximately 8:40 P.M. my wife and I were driving home from a church meeting. It was a clear night with no clouds in the sky. We were traveling south on Route 18 about 3 miles west of Middleport, N.Y. when I noticed a bright light in the eastern sky. I pointed it out to my wife. We both watched it for about 5 minutes. It appeared to be hovering in the air and changing colors from bright white to orange to red. After hovering for about 5 minutes it suddenly took off at a high rate of speed and disappeared over the horizon in a matter of seconds. I have never seen anything like it before. It was quite a sight. I would be willing to take a lie detector test or send a committee to come to Middleport to check out the details of my story. Please let me know if you require any additional information.
