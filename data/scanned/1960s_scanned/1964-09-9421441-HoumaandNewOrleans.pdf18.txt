State Representative Sees UAO in Louisiana

We can thank Member Robert G. Atchison for the information given here. He is a State Representative Charles G. Schiller, an electronics engineer, who was returning to New Orleans from the Michoud Plant and was returning to New Orleans from a consultaton in Baton Rouge. It was a very clear night, and Mr. Schiller saw a "metallic object" over Lake Pontchartrain on Monday (September 14) at 11:15 PM. He said he stopped his car and watched the object for about 5 minutes and it didn't move. He had no definite shape. He glanced at the time and when he looked back, the object was gone.
Paul Atkinson of the Times-Picayune of New Orleans, had an article in the September 16 edition, telling about this sighting in the Lake Pontchartrain area. He said the man claimed the object as about the size of a passenger jet, and it was a "glowing, dull silvery color". With that of Eastern Air Lines Pilot Truman Gifls in 1957 when a craft was "trailing a thin silver line behind it, and rotating, and it was getting ready to take off from Lafayette (sic). He watched it for 2 minutes, then the crew and they watched the craft make a "shallow angle climb out and then abrupt departure-just faded away, he said.
A Michoud plant engineer, including the sighting of the principal witness and the sighting of a "round, luminous object" over Lake Pontchartrain on August 31, by District Judge Driver P. Schilling, and Assistant District Attorney it was "between an estimated 600-1000 feet in altitude", was also mentioned.
