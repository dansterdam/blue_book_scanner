We are in receipt of a letter from a citizen concerning her observation or report of a UFO sighting on 3 Sept 65 at 1045 pm which is similar to many reports which our project has received on occasions. Her previous observation of the object indicates that in our evaluation, it is suggested that an AF Form 164 be sent to her along with a 3" x 5" card for additional information that we require for a more complete evaluation. It is suggested that Mr Stanley Shuff of the Ohio Ground Observer's Corp be notified by the Air Force.
