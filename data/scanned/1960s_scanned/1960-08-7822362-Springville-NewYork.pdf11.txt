The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document. The document appears to be a letter from the U.S. Air Force's Public Information Division, addressed to a person in Springville, New York. The letter acknowledges the recipient's letter from September 22, 1960, concerning an unidentified flying object observed on August 25. The letter states that the original letter contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion, and therefore requests that the recipient provide the documents related to the case to the Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for further analysis and evaluation.

Here is the full text of the document:

19 October 1960

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Sincerely,
