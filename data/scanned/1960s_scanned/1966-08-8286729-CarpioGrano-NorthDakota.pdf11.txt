1. This office has no explanation for this incident. It seems possible that ball lightning (or similar) was sighted in an aerial maneuver which caused a temporary failure to interruptcommunications - but not for 36 hours.

It is suggested that this is an ideal case with which to inaugurate the $300,000 contract with the University of Colorado.
