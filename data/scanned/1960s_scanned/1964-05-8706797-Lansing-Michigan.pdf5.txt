The bluish, circular object was described as "a great, big, swift, sort of spinning" and a "light-colored, shiny, metallic thing."
Witnesses began phoning reports to Lansing police and radio and television stations shortly after the first sighting at 12:10 a.m.
Many of the sightings were in an area near the East Lansing Shopping Center at Old Groesbeck on Lansing's northwest side.
