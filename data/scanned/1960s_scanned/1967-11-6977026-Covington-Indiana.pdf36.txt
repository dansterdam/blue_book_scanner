1. On the night of 18 Nov 1967, at approximately 10:30 p.m. local time, a couple living next door looked outside and saw an elderly couple outside their house. The elderly couple was attracted to the sky since it was clouding in. While looking into the southeastern direction, they watched a peculiar light pass across the sky from SE to NW. Her attention fell to a second "light" following the first. The time was between 10:30 - 10:40. As they looked inside and told her husband what she had seen. "They both went out still a third "formation" was seen coming from the SE. Policyhold camera at the request of her husband because he wanted to see if the objects would "show up" on the film. Time lapse approximately 10 minutes (10:40 - 10:52). By this time the first object disappeared overhead, the second "formation" showed up again nearer in attitude, but not so distinctive in brilliance and composition, compared with the first. Also took a sharp backing from the film. Only the larger object in two shots and two follow one another in their sequence the smaller ones.

2. The flight path appeared straight, the objects going from SE to NW. There was no note heard. The lead object did not change position or altitude or laterally, and the "diamond formation" maintained its integrity through the observation. No hovering or apparent speed change.
