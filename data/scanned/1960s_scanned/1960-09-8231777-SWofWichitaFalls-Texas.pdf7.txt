Something was reported as having hit the ground at Sheppard AFB. Reports coming to ATIC with great frequency. The 112th group from Ft. Belvoir has been sent to scene. First report to ATIC said it was seen in the early morning of 28 September and that a search would be started by Sheppard at daybreak. In addition to personnel at Sheppard investigating, press is on scene, also radio and TV. Nothing on the space track. ATIC has no positive information, but does not believe it to be a moon dust item (this is their vernacular for the refuse of any earth launched satellite, or what have you). People at Sheppard claim they know that it fell in a nearby area. ATIC believes that it is meteoric. Major Cooper may be contacted Tel 3225621, ext 516.
