This page from the Project Blue Book document contains two sketches, but no photograph. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an object above it. The instructions ask the viewer to mark the positions of the object when it was first seen (point "A") and when it was last seen (point "B"). 

The second sketch shows two larger sketches. The one on the left depicts a road with buildings on either side, and a person standing in the road. The one on the right shows a landscape with a person in the foreground.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
