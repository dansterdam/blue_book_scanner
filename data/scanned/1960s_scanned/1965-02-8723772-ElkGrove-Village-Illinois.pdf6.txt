Major Quintanilla 3 June 1965
Elk Grove Village, February 8, 1965

to hear the NICAP people regaling one of the NBC crew members and to talk with some local and interested parties...They didn't know that a special agent was listening. Along with the usual vilification of the Air Force, they spoke of a radio program put on at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and wandering into a forbidden area near there where they found "little green men" or the least models of them. They were shooed out of this "restricted" area...Then the NICAP man went on to say that NICAP would have to show that during the Banmendian saucer incident the Air Force was in "dereliction of duty" as the U.S. had not reacted properly. If those were not his exact words, that was certainly the sense of it. The NICAP members showed out in their usual uncritical form that those men however are believed to be undeniably chatty and certainly fair and honest, according to their lights.

We finally got away from there at 1:20 a.m. and the next day I'm thinking this over, I came upon what is probably the solution.

I asked the girl where the moon was and she stated that she did not see the moon, but that it was very clear. She said she knew it was too light to see the moon. This seems to be a good reason and quite significant...Neighbors and there were no clouds, but we should check meteorological conditions on that day...

References to the nautical almanac for February 8 (the first said) which would have showed this whole case out of control, but it now has been established that she went to the doctor on February 9. Therefore, the declination was 15~ and fully illumination...There is no question from her general demeanor that she is excitable, and most people are not aware of how the moon looks at exactly first quarter or nearly first quarter.
