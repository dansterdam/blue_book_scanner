TO: HQ USAF SAPODC (Mrs Hunt) 
WASH DC 20330

Mrs Hunt has requested an evaluation of his report on the UFO sighting in Little Rock, Arkansas. This observation is evaluated as a satellite. The description, duration and direction of flight are consistent with this analysis. The project has coordinated this finding with other reporting agencies and evaluated meteorological, astronomical, or atmospheric conditions, such as an inversion. There are more than thirty satellites visible at times which are visible to the naked eye.
