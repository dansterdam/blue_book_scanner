The Old Question: Do Flying Saucers Exist?
From the Stars, Says "Yes"
According to a statement made recently by Mr. Julian Whipple, the Science Director of the Harvard Observatory, the old question of whether or not flying saucers exist still remains unanswered. He said, "We have seen so many objects in the sky that could not be easily identified that there is evidence that some such things as flying saucers exist."

Mr. Whipple was among a group of scientists who have expressed definite opinions that such unidentified flying objects do exist and he indicated that many eminent astronomers and other scientists are convinced that they have seen strange objects in the sky.

The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) has collected many reports from reliable witnesses, including pilots, military personnel and others, indicating the existence of strange flying objects. The sightings have come from every part of the world and have been reported by responsible individuals who have no reason to fabricate stories. The Air Force Project Blue Book is continuously analyzing all reports of unidentified flying objects.

Some of these reports are quite definite and descriptive. For example, the crew of a Northwest Airlines plane reported seeing an object the size of a B-47 bomber which maneuvered above them at an estimated speed of 4,500 mph. The object was observed for several minutes. Other pilots have reported seeing objects that performed aerial maneuvers impossible for any known aircraft. The pilots are convinced they saw something completely foreign to any aircraft with which they are familiar.

The only point that seems to be debated is the nature of these flying objects. There are many theories - some say they are interplanetary vehicles, while others suggest they are some form of natural phenomenon as yet unknown to science. The Air Force apparently has no definite explanation for many of the UFO sightings, but continues to investigate all reliable reports.

Whether these objects represent visitors from another planet or are some form of unusual natural phenomena, the fact remains that experienced and reliable observers have seen these strange objects under conditions which make their reports highly impressive. The mystery continues.
