There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, which appears to be an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

a real saucer? a - that's the limit a yellowy one light on top bottom light on and a ring of colored lights all around it was circling round and had a sound to it like a dynamo one blinded me suddenly then went off into the woods - faster speed than a jet or anything i'd seen - seemed to appear going very fast and then slowed down closer to me my car had engine stall and lights went out as it passed over it the lights came back on when it got farther away - i've seen enough of them this time i want to report it the color seemed to change as it moved appeared very bright the experience of myself and - can concur in the report and pay my fine if necessary because i'm convinced now even more of this visitatation - there can't be any question now in my mind these are real vehicles and not imaginings or optical illusions the publicity put out confusing the public is what has been for a long time in my opinion, to give the public doubt and the various military spokesmen have been helping in this as this case shows. i may be forced to take a polygraph test as well to show i'm telling the truth, but i have no fear of that either way the thing that flew over us was not anything like a jet or anything man-made.
