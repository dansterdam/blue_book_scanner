The image does not contain any photographs. However, it appears to be a page from a UFO report document, containing handwritten text describing a UFO sighting.

The text reads as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 30 March 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting.

As UFO #1 was almost on horizon, just hovering very fast, there was an instantaneous, extremely bright flash, approx. 45Â° up and to the right. Our attention was attracted to it, naturally. From the location of the flash came UFO #2, traveling very fast. It slowed down, hovered over the other spot on the horizon where UFO #1 had just disappeared. In 2-3 d, it was about 1/2 mile or UFO's ft. of second duration away. The same soft white color was not as intense, either, as UFO #1. We watched it year at 2125 I left with my office soon to take him to a dance; UFO #2 was still hovering. It's subsequent actions, to me bearable, can be deduced, if desired, by the listed witnesses of the report on UFO #1.

The flash was somewhat I had never seen before. If had no color, but that doesn't really describe it for an analogue could be a flash bulb (detached), or an instantaneous magnetic flare or what have you heard for instance. Actually, intuition says it came from UFO #2. No stable high performance visible or stable UFO was but there was certainly an occurrence.
