DEAR SIR:

This letter concerns my witnessing the U.F.O. sighting last Sunday night while crossing the bridge over Weston Lake, south of Greenfield.
I noticed a large glow in the sky to the west. As it came closer I noticed that this was not a plane. There were no signs of lights four to six in number, evenly spaced, with trails similar to meteors. I requested the lady cab driver to pull over so I could get a better look.
As I got out of the car, the object passed directly overhead, moving rapidly. The lights and trails did not diminish or change. There was no sound. The cab driver and her eight year old daughter watched these lights with me. They agree to the above and feel this was a person who has amateur experience in stars and night observations. It is suggested that I contact this number to think this was authentic. Common sense suggests to me that this was a space flight.

Personal note: I am not a kook or individual prone to imagination. I feel this is worth your investigation.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
