Transcription of the text:

8 January 1965

Mr. [redacted]
Toledo, Ohio 43614  
Dear Mr. [redacted],

The sighting of June 13, 1964 could have been caused by a luminescent or great metallic-appearing cloud cover a few inches in diameter. The appearance as a nearby, stationary celestial object was no doubt an illusion due to atmospheric distortion.

Illumination is a problem, however, and it appears that you could not have seen details or color. The fact that the object appeared to change from stationary to apparently moving and back again, is characteristic of atmospheric effects and not a solid, physical object.

I am sorry that this does not fit your observation, but this is the only explanation that seems plausible to me. If you could provide any additional details that might clarify the sighting, I would be glad to consider them.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
