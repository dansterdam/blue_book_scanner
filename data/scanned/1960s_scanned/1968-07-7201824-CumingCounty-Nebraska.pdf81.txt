such a plasmoid might be moved from the high altitude of its formation down- wards to lower altitudes, against its buoyancy.

This characteristic of plasmoids, to move along magnetic force lines, seems to be common for many reported sightings, as for instance, the descending course frequently mentioned (as greatest speed) and the prevalence of their occurrence near transformer stations and similar situations.

The observed long life of some plasmoids is difficult to interpret if they are assumed to contain gases of our atmosphere only. cases of high ionization electrical, which indicate the presence of charged particles, like lightning, have to be considered, which would give an idea of the consequences the passage of the components of a plasmoid, of elements of the ionized end of the table, with their high concentration potentials, should substantially extend its life.

I know of only few reported observations of the collapse of ball lightning cases of recombination energy, by describing carbonized vegetation and sand fused into glass at the point of ground contact.

I hope that the foregoing will help you to show that a rather large body of evidence points in the direction of our present report, and that a consideration should be given to the possibility that a considerable number of supposedly unexplained UFO-occurrences could be plausibly interpreted as theories that belong to science fiction.
