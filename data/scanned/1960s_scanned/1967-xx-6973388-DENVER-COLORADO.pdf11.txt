TYPED COMMENTS MADE BY DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK ON 31 OCTOBER 1968

DENVER, COLORADO
Evaluation should be changed to "Insufficient Information".-

whole thing seems unreliable. eg. "10 feet diameter held at arm's
length!"
Finally, reported by a 20 yr. old lad. Gross lack of information
bits for the input.
