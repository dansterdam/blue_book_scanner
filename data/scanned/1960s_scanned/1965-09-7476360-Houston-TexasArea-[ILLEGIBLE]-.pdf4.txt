The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten diagram and text. The diagram appears to be a sketch or drawing depicting the motion and path of an unidentified object in the sky, with directions and compass points labeled. The text accompanying the diagram provides instructions and questions related to observing and recording the object's movement.

27. In the following sketch, imagine you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Show how the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" and "B" on the start and end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
