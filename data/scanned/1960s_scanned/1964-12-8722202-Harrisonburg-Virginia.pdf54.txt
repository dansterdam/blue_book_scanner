Just Don't Shoot, Sheriff Warns

Virginians See Flying Saucers

By TOM PENDERGAST

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - All the little green men reported in the sky, Sheriff Rutland Hamm of Augusta County says, "Just don't shoot. I ain't going to let anybody in the county start shooting." 

"This thing has gotten completely out of hand," says Sheriff Hamm. 

If John B. Kent, of Augusta County, "is right, and we see reflections of these strange objects in the sky," then anyone carrying firearms accompanying them, "will be dealt with, says Hamm.  

"Besides, he adds, even if creatures from outer space have landed us - 'Who's got the right to move them down?'"

Even the Air Force has gotten into the act. It has discovered no evidence to confirm the existence of either flying saucers or little green men. But, for the record, "Our cause are never closed until the reported objects are satisfactorily identified."

Almost daily, Virginians are reporting "unidentified flying objects - UFO - in several parts of the state. And some claim they have seen little green men wandering around on the ground." 

"Anyone can go out at night," says Kent, "and see strange things in the sky."
