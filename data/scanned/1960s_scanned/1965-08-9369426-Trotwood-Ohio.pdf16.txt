Here is the text extracted from the document:

Gentlemen:

I recently visited my son, his wife and their child in-law and found the visit to be particularly interesting because it gave me a chance to meet my daughter-in-law and to observe certain phenomena which she had not seen before.

My son's wife told me that she had seen something rather strange in the sky, which she did not understand, sometime before my visit. She did not report it to anyone but friends and family. She did not know what it was.

Her name is XXXXX. XXXXX, Colorado.

The date of the sighting was between the 15th and 20th of August, 1966, sometime between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 midnight. She and her brother were in the car, she was driving, her brother was in the passenger seat, when they noticed something strange in the sky. It was about 3:30 p.m. and the night was clear with the moon. 

Joe saw the UFO first as he was gazing out the window and it appeared suddenly. It was white in color and seemed larger than a plane and lower than a plane. It was brighter than the stars and appeared to be solid. The object was cigar-shaped with a glow around it. It seemed to be hovering or very slowly moving. It was between 500 yards and 1 mile from their car. The object was stationary and was not a shadow but a glow. The object seemed to be projecting rather than part of or a shadow. This object was silent and did not have any lights such as would be on an airplane. It had no sound and did not appear to be moving in any direction. It just seemed to be hovering or sitting. After a short time, it simply disappeared.
