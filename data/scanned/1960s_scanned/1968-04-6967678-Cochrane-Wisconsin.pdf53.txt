LEITHA - 19

And some of the school teachers were 
like I was a crack, and my husband said he wished it had been him instead 
of me, and I wished it would have too.

H    Well, I wish it would have been me, because I have never seen anything
like that; I would like to.

L    I'd never want to see one again.

H    You don't, huh?

L    No sir.  Not after that, because I thought it had control of me, and 
when it came above us - you know if you stay in a house at night and 
everything is still, there's still the noises of living, you know, but
when this thing was there, there wasn't even the noise of living.  It
was nothing.  It was an eerie quiet.

H    I see.

L    And then something else I was thinking about.  When it got hot it was so
hot that you're feet and your hands, it was when like when you touch
dry ice.  That's the kind of hot it was.  Real hot like that, but it
seemed like it was in an oven, and yet it was just that hot.  It was
just instant hot.

H    So I' suppose you'd call it a sort of a dry heat.

L    Yes, and at the same time it was stuffy.  Kind of choked in your breathing.

H    Well, is there anything more that you could tell me.  For instance, how
did you feel the next day.  Both physically and mentally?  I mean how did
xxxxxxxxxxxx I don't mean that it affected you mentally, I mean how did
you think about it?

L    Well, every time I went outside I was looking up.  And I guess maybe
inside I felt a kind of jittery and outside I didn't shake or anything, 
but I was still uneasy and I kept looking up and for a while - now it's
almost a year later - but for a while, I though, Gee, if they have
some place on this thing, you know, this spaceship.
