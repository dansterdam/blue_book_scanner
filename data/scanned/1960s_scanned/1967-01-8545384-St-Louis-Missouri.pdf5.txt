Transcribing the text in the document:

I am related by sight of the case and watched through my window the object as it came overhead. Without a doubt the object was not a conventional aircraft and moved with a speed and maneuverability far beyond any plane I have ever seen. The object made no noise and was emitting a strange reddish-orange glow. It hovered a moment and then shot vertically upwards at an incredible speed, far faster than any jet aircraft. I am at a loss to explain what I saw, but I can assure you it was no ordinary aircraft. The object was clearly not of this world. I hope this report will be of some value to your investigation. Please let me know if you require any further information.

Sincerely,
