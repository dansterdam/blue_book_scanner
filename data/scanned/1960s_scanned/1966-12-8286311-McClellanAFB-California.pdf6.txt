Proposed reply to letter from G. M. Coia, 19 December 1966

Dear Mr. Coia,

This replies to your letter of 19 December 1966, in which you requested information on any planets which may have been responsible for your unusual observation.

A review of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac 1966, revealed that Jupiter was rising on an azimuth of approximately 55 degrees at the time of the sighting. Jupiter, with a stellar magnitude of -2.1 on 17 December 1966 would have been quite bright and could have accounted for the observation.

Your sighting occurred outside the limits of the United States. We wish to thank you for bringing this sighting to the attention of the United States Air Force.
