"Subject: G. F. Dale, R.R. 4, Dale, Indiana. 

On 8/29/64, at 11:35 PM, all July 29, 1964, G. F. Dale, RR4, Dale, Indiana, reported sighting along his driveway room (13 yards from house). Dale claims he was attempting to retrieve his cows (which had escaped from pasture). As he was walking along, he observed a round, reddish-orange light in the sky. The light appeared to be about 300 yards to the northeast, and was about 10 to 15 feet off the ground. He estimated the diameter of the object to be about 15 to 20 feet. Dale watched the object for about 15 minutes, during which time it remained stationary. He then attempted to approach the light, but could not get any closer to it. The light then began to move, at a very rapid rate, and disappeared from sight in a northeasterly direction. Dale claimed that when the object was directly over his head, he could hear a humming sound, similar to a transformer. At the time of the sighting, the sky was clear and the moon was shining brightly.

Dale stated that he has served in the Armed Forces, and was stationed in France during W.W. II. He claims to have had no previous sightings of unidentified flying objects, and stated that he knows of no one else who observed the object on this occasion. Dale is employed as a welder, and has the reputation of being a reliable, sober, and truthful individual. The investigator has talked to Dale on several occasions, and has found him to be a very straightforward and credible witness.

It is the opinion of the investigator that Dale observed some type of unidentified flying object on the night of July 29, 1964."
