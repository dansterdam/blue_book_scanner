The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from the Anaconda Building Materials Company in Hamilton, Montana. The text in the document discusses an observation of something that was viewed at 9:35 P.M. on the evening of July 8th, 1963. The observer described seeing a "large, disc-shaped object" that flew across the sky and then disappeared. The observer states that he had observed the object through binoculars and noticed that it had changed direction several times. The letter provides details about the observer's experience and their thoughts on the incident, but does not contain any photographic evidence.

Dear Sirs:

I am inquiring into what I viewed at 9:35 P.M. on the evening of the 4th of July, 1963. A disc-shaped object that was brightly illuminated came across the sky and disappeared in the distance. I had never looked at the moon through binoculars and he said that he hadn't. The object turned bright when it was closer and we all saw it in bright light. I had the glasses again at that time, and I said I doubt if it made them any more. Then just bright was even brighter. I thought that if they were deceiving me, but after close observation, the star that I had picked out was smaller than it and went across the sky. It proceeded and said yes, that is what I saw. The object was estimated to be approximately 45o tangent in relationship to the horizon and moving from east to south. It looked exactly like the ones I have seen before in the newspapers. I do not know if you would be interested in knowing what this object was, but if you don't mind, I would be interested in knowing what this object was as I could not find any mention of it on the radio or read of it in the paper. I sincerely thank you for any information that you can furnish me in this matter.

Sincerely yours,
