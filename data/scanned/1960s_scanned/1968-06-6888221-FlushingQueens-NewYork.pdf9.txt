AS SKY DARKER, OBJECT RETAINED
VISIBLE; WHERE BRILLIANT-
LUMINOUS

1. WHAT FIRST CALLED THE ATTENTION OF THE OBSERVER(S) TO THE OBJECT(S)?
A OBJECT FIRST SEEN IN PHOTOGRAPH - VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE - REASON FOR TAKING THE PHOTO

2. A. WHAT WAS THE ANGLE OF ELEVATION OF THE OBJECT(S) WHEN FIRST OBSERVED? (THE HORIZON IS 0 DEGREES, DIRECTLY OVERHEAD 90 DEGREES). THE OBJECT MUST APPEAR IN THIS PHOTO 5 TO 50 DEGREES. LOOKING UP IN THE SKY WOULD BE 45 DEGREES.

B. IN WHICH DIRECTION WAS THE OBSERVER LOOKING WHEN THE OBJECT(S) WAS (WERE) FIRST OBSERVED? (USE NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST OR POINTS IN BETWEEN.)
WEST IN 3 PHOTOS
SOUTH IN ONE

* Mr. [redacted] saw the objects after developed - reason for taking this photo is a very difficult to see object in the photo, angle from one photo to another varies, unable to find reference for measuring angle from horizon.
