CHEMICAL LAUNCHES CONTINUE

EGLIN AFB, FLA., JAN. 17--A chemically produced vapor cloud was visible within a 300 mile radius of Eglin AFB Monday evening due to the second day's third high altitude research smoke test launched from the Air-Space Launch Facility on Santa Rosa Island.

The second launch of the day took place at 5:13 p.m. (C.S.T.), followed by a third at 6 p.m. The final two launches are scheduled to take place late Wednesday afternoon.

Both launches Monday evening were very successful according to Mr. Marshall Cartledge, Space Systems Branch of the Aircraft and Missile Test Division, Air Proving Ground Center. The launch vehicle, a two stage Nike-Iroquois, contained a vaporized barium payload which was released at an altitude of 100 nautical miles.

Mr. Cartledge said the cloud formed an elongated pattern along the lines of the earth's magnetic field. The cloud drifted in a northeasterly direction and was visible for 30 minutes.
