There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document that contains only text.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

7. The object of concern to me appears to be very nearly in focus. The witness pointed out in his letter that it would not be too in focus. However, I shall reproduce one of the other possible object photographs which is out of focus, showing the blurred characteristics of the other objects.

8. The difference is very much in evidence around the object indicated. The distance is indicated to be less than 200 yards from the points forwarded to me.

9. The appearance of this object indicates that it is fairly transluscent in the same direction as the one previously mentioned. This, coupled with the fact that the background is slightly distorted through it, indicates that the object is probably real and not just an image on a screen.

10. Distortion of the sun in the vertical plane is a common phenomenon as you notice is indicated in this case. Other frequent distortions of this type which results from discontinuities in the atmosphere, it would appear that if this were a real object it would have shown some distortion.

11. I am of the opinion that the object is translucent, and the spot on the film gives evidence of high intensity, probably due to translucency in the direction to the observer.

12. The two photographs of the same scene were taken at Arcata, California (140 52' - 124 05') on 9 April 1960. At 11:03 EST and 12:04 EST (16:03 GMT). The elevation was 35 degrees, and the azimuth was approximately 160 degrees, with four minutes between exposures. It is possible that the object moved between exposures.

13. The photographs are being retained at AFSC as a part of this case file.
