34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 29 9 67
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

After we reported the sighting, several reliable sources reported seeing something unusual but never reported it for fear of being ridiculed. 

The only thing we want you to believe is, we did see something that neither they nor I are familiar with.

If you ever find out what that thing was, it would be thankful if you somehow let us know so we can stop wondering.
