"Poulabaro, 
3-39-66

Gentlemen,
Some time in the fore part of the month of January 1966 there was an occurrence or incident of something unusual being observed in the sky, apparently a vehicle floating or hovering a short distance above the ground. It was observed for some time by a number of people and there were bright lights observed by this group, the lights at times appearing to move and at times remaining stationary. 
There was no apparent change in the speed or direction of the vehicle during the time it was observed, which was reported to be approximately 15 minutes. The vehicle or object was reported to be about 75 to 100 feet in diameter and of a dark color. There were no noise or sounds associated with the object.
These are the basic facts as I have been able to determine them from talking to the people who observed the incident. There is no way of verifying at this time the accuracy or completeness of their statements.
Apparently the people who observed the incident are convinced that they saw an unusual object in the sky that evening, but I have no way of determining the validity of their observations or the conclusions they have reached. It is submitted for whatever consideration you may give it.
Sincerely, 
/s/ unknown"
