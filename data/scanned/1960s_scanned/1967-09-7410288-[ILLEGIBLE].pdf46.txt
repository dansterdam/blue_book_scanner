There is no photograph present in this page from the UFO report document. However, the page contains several sketches and illustrations, including a compass rose diagram and a series of sketches related to tracking the motion of an unidentified object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the sketch where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the sketch where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course of the motion.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
