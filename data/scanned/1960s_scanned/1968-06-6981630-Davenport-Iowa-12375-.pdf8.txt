DAVENPORT, IOWA 

On June 6, 1968, at approximately 9:40 PM, several witnesses reported seeing an unidentified flying object in the sky over Davenport, Iowa. The object was described as a dark, elliptical shape that hovered in the air for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view.

According to the witness reports, the object was seen by multiple people in the area and was estimated to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. No sound was heard coming from the object, and it did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion.

The incident was reported to the local authorities, who in turn notified the United States Air Force's Project Blue Book, the official government program for investigating UFO sightings. An investigation was launched, and the case was documented in the Project Blue Book records.

The photograph included in the file appears to be a blurry image of the object as reported by the witnesses. However, the quality of the image makes it difficult to discern any clear details or features of the object.
