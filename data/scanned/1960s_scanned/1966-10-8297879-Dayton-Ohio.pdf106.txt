11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers watched a cylindrical shaped object move off toward the southwest. It discharged some diffuse material into the path of the object which was observed. The front part had a red light. The red light pulsated and the following part displayed a constant direction and constant speed. Description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. The flashing red light could have been the anti-collision light that all aircraft must have in operation when in flight.
