Dear Morris Broomall:
A friend of mine has seen what he claims to be an USAF bomber on August 8 about 10:30 pm. Is there any possiblity that this could have been a UFO which might have been taking pictures of the area? I would apreciate any information you may have.
I am Thomas D. J. Phillips, a Registered Nurse with a keen interest in science and philosophy, and I would welcome any leads that you may have that would be of use in pursuing this matter further.
Your truly yours,
Thomas D. J. Phillips
(Area code 215)
