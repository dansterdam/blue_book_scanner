OFFICE OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS INVESTIGATIONS
Dear Sir:
In light of the recent reports of U.F.O. sightings, I have been disturbed by the contents of your report. While these sightings have become more numerous, I am concerned about the lack of concrete evidence to substantiate their veracity. 
On the night of 28 June 1965, around the time of 7:30 P.M., several objects were sighted over Exeter, New Hampshire. These objects were described as being metallic in appearance, and it was noted that they seemed to be hovering and maneuvering in the night sky. While I understand the interest and excitement surrounding such phenomena, I must caution that hasty conclusions should not be drawn. The reports indicate that the objects were heavily clouded and were very low in the sky, which could potentially lead to misidentification. I would strongly urge that a more thorough investigation be conducted before any definitive statements are made.
Furthermore, I am concerned about the reports of civilian witnesses claiming to have seen these objects. It is my belief that such sightings are more likely the result of misidentification or overactive imaginations than any tangible phenomenon. I would encourage you to be more skeptical of such accounts and to seek out more reliable sources of information.
In closing, I would like to reiterate my concern about the lack of concrete evidence to support the claims made in your report. While I do not wish to dismiss the possibility of unidentified flying objects, I believe that a more measured and scientific approach is necessary. I hope that you will take these concerns into consideration as you continue your investigations.
I hope this will aid your investigations.
Sincerely,
