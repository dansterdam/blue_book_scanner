More UFOs Spotted Here

"They" were back Monday night. Strange unidentified objects sighted again in Oklahoma - some say they were "rather scary" compared to the fleet of unidentified flying objects seen over seven other states.

An Oklahoma highway patrolman spotted a green luminescent object on Oklahoma Highway 51 near Claremore last night. The officer said a jet interceptor approached the object but it disappeared.

The officer said a lot of other people also had observed the object and that several of them had called the UFO and appeared to be close to it.

Living costs to go up

The cost of living, says RAYMOND ORTIZ, will rise dramatically in the future due to inflation and other reasons. Ortiz, who has been investigating the UFO situation, says the appearance of the strange objects some call "flying saucers" will create a tremendous public interest in the subject. This in turn will lead to more scientific research and that research will increase the cost of living, Ortiz predicts.

The story about "More UFOs Spotted Here" describes the sighting of strange unidentified objects in Oklahoma, including a report from a highway patrolman who observed a green luminescent object and a jet interceptor approaching it. The "Youth Has His Say" section features a prediction by RAYMON ORTIZ about the cost of living increasing in the future due to inflation and increased scientific research into UFOs.
