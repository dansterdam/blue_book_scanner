Vandenberg Sighting Report

5. There were several visual sightings in addition to the initial visual sighting as 2300.

6. Three flights of fighters were dispatched by the Air Defense Command to investigate; they found nothing.

7. The radars were closed down and the exercise terminated at approximately 2:30 am at a time when targets were still being observed but remained completely unidentified.

8. The tracking radars had produced (and the results were available to us for study) numerical data on the targets including range, azimuth, elevation, and velocity, printed out at 15-second intervals.

Detailed Description of Sightings

Information Available Before Investigation
was visiting at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena on other contract business. A telephone call from the office in Boulder advised that Blue Book had notified us of a very interesting sighting at Vandenberg involving simultaneous visual and radar observations. It was reported; in addition, that in a test three nights after the sightings, made to determine whether the radars could be made to observe bogeys similar in nature to those seen the night of October 6, the radars did in fact pick up targets that looked similar. decided to extend his trip by one day and visit Lompoc on October 18. agreed to accompany him. A subsequent trip proved necessary on November 8. In reporting the circumstances of the sightings, information learned on the two trips will, in general, be reported as if accumulated at one time. This will contribute to clarity of the report.
