The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved horizon line, with the instruction to place a mark "A" on the curve to indicate how high the observed object was above the horizon when it was first seen. The second sketch shows a landscape view with a person standing on a road, with the instruction to place a mark "A" on the sketch to indicate the position of the object when it was first seen.

32. In the following sketch, Imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object became later.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" on the position where the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this.
