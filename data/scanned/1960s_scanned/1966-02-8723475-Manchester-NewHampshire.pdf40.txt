Place: Manchester N.H., Hayward Street near Porter Street looking North. 2 U.F.O.'s going west toward the Merrimack River coming from the East. Objects seem to be directly over Rt.101, time 1+ minute. 
At ******** Street, KED1680 was watching Channel 7, TV interference 8:28 to 8:35, placed call from Midland 1-Watt transceiver on Channel 9 to KED1680 about U.F.O. The transmission was interrupted, cut off the fellows in Derry, they were not heard for a few seconds. KED1689 had to repeat transmission. The object was first seen by Mr. ******** street. He was with me at the time we watched the U.F.O.'s with my binoculars at 7X. The objects were flat on bottom, round on top, sort of reddish orange. Accidently turned on portable spot light and the rear object also flashed bright light 2 or 3 seconds later for about 6 seconds about the same time length as my light was on. We were on foot. KED1680 resides at *********.
