Dear Colonel Evans:

We have completed our examination of the material submitted with your letter of May 5. Microscopic analysis shows the presence of a portion of an ordinary pancake made predominantly of buckwheat. Radioactivity gave results which are consistent with the activity found in ordinary pancake of terrestrial origin.

Remainder of the cake is being returned, herewith.

Sincerely yours,
