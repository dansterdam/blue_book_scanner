The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a form titled "Force UFO form continued". The form appears to be related to a Project Blue Book investigation and contains various questions about a UFO sighting, including questions about the speed, direction, and location of the object. The text in the form is clearly legible, and I will provide the transcription of the text below without identifying any individuals.
