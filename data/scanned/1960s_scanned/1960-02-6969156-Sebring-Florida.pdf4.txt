The image contains three sketches, but no photographs. 

The first sketch shows a curved line with a point labeled "A" on it, and another point labeled "B" on the same line. The text describes this as showing how high an object was above the horizon when it was first seen, and how high it was above the horizon when it was seen later.

The second and third sketches are larger and show different landscape scenes. The second sketch appears to show a road or path with mountains or hills in the background. The third sketch shows a person standing and looking out at a horizon with mountains or hills.
