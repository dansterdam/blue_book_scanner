REF CNO MSC DATED 12 OCT 61, DTG 201442Z SUBJ UFO EVALUATION. THE PTD
EVALUATION OF THE CAPE CANAVERAL UFO SIGHTING WHICH OCCURRED ON
7 SEP 61 DURING THE TESTING OF A TITAN MISSILE IS AS FOLLOWS:

PART ONE. BASED ON FACT THAT "BOOGIE" IMAGE WAS SEEN ONLY BY BU
CAMERA AT PATRICK AFB AND NOT BY SENSORS AT OTHER TRACKING SITES, IT
IS CONCLUDED THAT "BOOGIE" WAS NOT, IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO
TITAN. PART TWO. CALCULATIONS BASED ON MISSILE POSITION AT BURN OUT,
THE TIME WHEN "BOOGIE" APPEARED, INDICATES THAT THE IMAGE IS VERY PROBABLY THAT OF A SMALL METALLIC GAMMA FLASHING IN SURFACE OF THIS
ANALYSIS ARE ASFDE FILMS USING THE SAME TYPE OF EQUIPMENT WHICH SHOW
STAR TRACKS SIMILAR TO THAT OBSERVED IN THE TITAN FILM. PART THREE.
THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL DATA HAS BEEN REVIEWED ACCORDING TO CONFIRM
THE EVALUATION:
A. COMPLETE MISSILE TRAJECTORY DATA AS CONTAINED IN
"DATA REDUCTION REPORTS" PREPARED BY RCA/AMC. ACCURATE GEOGRAPHIC
POSITION, ALTITUDE AND VELOCITY DATA INDICATE THAT THERE IS NO
CORRELATION BETWEEN THE MISSILE AND THE "BOOGIE" IMAGE.
