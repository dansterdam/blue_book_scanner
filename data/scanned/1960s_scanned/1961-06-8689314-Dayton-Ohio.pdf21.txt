REPLY TO: GAFOL-32 (Major Coleman) 
SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING

1. Attached is a copy of a letter from Dr. and Mrs. ------------ reporting the UFO sighting incident and information concerning this case. Based on their report, this questionable report lacked much to be desired in the way of supporting evidence. It is suggested that perhaps Mrs. ------------ be contacted and asked to forward the original drawings, photographs or any other contact Mrs. ------------ may have had with the UFO and/or witnesses to the area office.

2. In what direction were you looking at the time the object was sighted?

3. Was the object first sighted straight ahead, or was it a little off to the side?

4. What was the elevation of the object when first sighted? What was its relative movement - from the horizon to overhead, etc.

5. Attached is a copy of a letter from Mr. ------------ reporting the sighting of a UFO. A child examination indicating this limited information reported. Therefore, suggest your office send him an ATIC form for completion.
