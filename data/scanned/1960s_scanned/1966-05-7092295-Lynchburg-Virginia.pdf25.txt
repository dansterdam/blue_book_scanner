The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed letter. The letter appears to be a response to a previous letter dated 13 December 1966, where the sender states that the United States Air Force does not investigate sightings outside the continental limits of the U.S. The letter goes on to say that the sighting was filed for information purposes and that Project Blue Book, the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects, is described.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Proposed reply to letter from ____________, 13 December 1966

The United States Air Force does not investigate sightings outside the continental limits of the U.S. Therefore, we filed your sighting for information purposes.
