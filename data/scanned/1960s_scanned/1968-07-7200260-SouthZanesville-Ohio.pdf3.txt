Text transcribed from the document:

Made Thursday, a friend and I observed a peculiar experience.

We were about 2 miles northeast of Zanesville, Ohio. Going in a test about two hundred (200) feet from the highway house. We were attracted down the road by the peculiar movement of grass and leaves in a circle about fifteen feet in diameter. This peculiar movement was observed for about one minute.

At the next moment observed a very dim beam of light on the ground a few feet in front of the grass was stopped, it seemed to disappear with a flash. I wondered if it was connected with the movement of the grass. I only had the flash light of the family. We drove into the tent and remained out, went back outside and showed them up the movement that was in the grass. I then turned my flashlight on the grass and there was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. There were no tracks in the grass and no disturbance whatsoever than what we had observed with our eyes. I would like to know your opinion on what we saw.

Yours truly,
