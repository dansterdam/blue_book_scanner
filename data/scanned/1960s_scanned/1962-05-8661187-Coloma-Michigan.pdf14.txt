The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with various questions and instructions for the witness to fill out.

The text from the document is as follows:

15. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color dark grayish or silver, white underside
17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and specifically outline trails or vapour trails if present. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

13. The edges of the object were:
a. Clearly defined
b. Like a bright star
c. Sharply outlined
d. Don't remember

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, than how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
