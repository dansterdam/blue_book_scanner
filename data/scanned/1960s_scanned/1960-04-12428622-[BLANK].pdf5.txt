The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a detailed textual description of a UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

To get back to France: How does one even begin to explain the first of the remarkable series of French reports? Well, if this case stood alone it would have little significance. Science cannot deal with an individual case. There be repetition, and pattern.

Three weeks later, September 14, there was a repetition--In broad daylight, and observed by hundreds of witnesses in a half dozen villages in the general area 250 miles S.W. of Paris. Only one newspaper mentioned it, and only by chance did 'it get investigated. Witnesses were mostly farmers and a few priests and schoolteachers. One witness reported: "It was about five in the afternoon. Emerging from the thick layer of clouds that looked like a storm coming up, we saw a sort of luminous blue violet mist, of a regular shape something like a cigar or a carrot. Actually the object came out of the layer of clouds in an almost horizontal position, slightly tilted toward the ground and pointing forward like a submerging submarine. This luminous cloud appeared motionless. Whenever it moved, its movements had no connection with the movement of the clouds, and it moved all of a piece, as if it were actually some gigantic machine surrounded by mists. It came down rather fast from the ceiling of clouds to an altitude which we thought was perhaps a half a mile above us. Then it stopped, and the point rose quickly until the object was in a vertical position, where it became motionless.
