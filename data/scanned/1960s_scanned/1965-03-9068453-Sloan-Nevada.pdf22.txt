The source of this UFO report visited the SPO PIO Office (SSI) on
12 August 1965 and provided the below information: Captain Charles
D. Keller, Commanding Officer at that time, conducted the interview.

Mr. ---- was employed by the ---- , Los Angeles, California.
On 20 March 1965 he was driving alone on U.S. Highway 91 about 20
miles out of Los Vegas. Going westward (arm of Sloan, Nevada) at
about 1930 hours he stopped the car on the road for some reason and
noticed a light off to his left in the direction of mountain area.
After stopping the car for about 10 minutes, an object 1000 to 1500
feet in altitude was observed. It appeared elliptical with a single
light intensity steady burning emission, relative to his car (estimated bearing about 150째). The UFO travelled in a northwesterly direction as he observed it.

He saw the object for the first seeing the UFO, took a camera which he had in
the car, but as he prepared to take a picture it turned towards him,
then turned away, and he did not take a picture. He reports that he
snapped the picture without using the viewfinder. It is the opinion that
he might be having memories of UFOs he reports to disappear." The sighting was
clear with no clouds or haze.

When the UFO first sighted it was at an angle of about 30째 - 40째
above the horizon. It moved across the sky in a horizontal path and
passed in front of the car at an estimated distance of about 800 -
1,000 feet. The object then made a sharp turn and climbed in an arc
passing over a small hill which can be seen in the photograph, it was at
an angle of less than 30째.
