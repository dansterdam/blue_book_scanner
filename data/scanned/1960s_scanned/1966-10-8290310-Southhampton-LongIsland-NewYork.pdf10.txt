The image provided does not contain a photograph. Instead, it appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s and 1960s. The page contains a handwritten annotation "576" at the top, and the text at the bottom says "Southhampton-LongIsland-NewYork".

As requested, I will now act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and produce all the text found in the document:

576
Southhampton-LongIsland-NewYork
