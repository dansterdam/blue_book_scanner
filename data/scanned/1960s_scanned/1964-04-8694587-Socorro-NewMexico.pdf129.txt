This page of the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a detailed written description of an incident that occurred in Socorro, New Mexico in 1964.

The text describes the events as reported by Lonnie Zamora, who was on patrol when he heard a noise and turned off the road to investigate. He described seeing an object on the ground and two people near it. The object was white or silver in color and egg-shaped. Zamora took Polaroid pictures of the area and the object, though the text does not indicate if those photographs are included in this document.

The text goes on to provide a detailed sequence of events, describing how Zamora observed the object, the noise it made, and its eventual departure. The text also mentions that Zamora's account was corroborated by other witnesses and investigators.
