The Commanding General:

The sighting on 23 February 1956 of an unidentified flying object observed near Nome, Alaska, is submitted for your consideration. 

On the date and time mentioned, a light was observed hovering over the town of Unalakleet, Alaska, by two reliable witnesses, one of who was a pilot employed by Wien Alaska Airlines. This light appeared to be about 100 feet in diameter and about 200 feet above the ground. It moved slowly in a southerly direction, stopping and starting in an erratic manner. The object finally disappeared in a southwesterly direction.

An investigation was made on the scene and statements were obtained from the witnesses, copies of which are attached. The object was observed for about 15 minutes and was considered to be definitely of an unidentified nature. No aircraft or other known objects could be associated with this sighting. The object was silent and no sound was heard.

On all of the available information relating to this sighting, it appears to have been a UFO of a type not previously reported. It is recommended that this report be forwarded to the ATIC for their consideration as to the possible identification of the object observed.

Respectfully,

G-2, USAF OF ALASKA
