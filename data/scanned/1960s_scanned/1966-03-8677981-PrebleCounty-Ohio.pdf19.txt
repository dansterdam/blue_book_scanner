There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object seemed to get more distant as we watched it. It seems to have drifted off, slowly fading into the distance.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):         Yes___   No___   Don't Know X   IF you answered Y...

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):         Yes___   No___   Don't Know X   IF you answered Y...

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - The object did not make any sound that we could hear.
b. Color - Light, silvery, metallic color, like a star reflecting sunlight.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known height - how much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Cannot be determined

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing things such as size, proportions, etc., and especially unusual trails or wings. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
(Drawing shows an oval-shaped object with a tail-like feature trailing behind it, which the testifier says appears to be a "light trail of some kind", not a physical tail. They also note the object seemed to fade away "rather than simply disappearing".)
