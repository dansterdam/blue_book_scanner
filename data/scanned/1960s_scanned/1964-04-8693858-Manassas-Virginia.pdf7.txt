(e.g. 270 degrees is a wind from the west, 250 degrees is from south of west). The rise rate is 1000 feet per minute. The 250 degrees winds would carry the radiosondes train into the NE quadrant which would appear to the observer as a movement to the north. The apparatus motion winds which occurred at higher elevations and from the SE quadrant. At this later time the distance of the radiosondes from the observer reduces the apparent motion.

3. No explanations of this nature are conclusive but there is enough consistency between the observations and the supporting data above to make our hypothesis plausible. Please let me know if more detailed analysis is required.
