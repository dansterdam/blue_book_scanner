The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document that is part of Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page discusses tape recordings that were made during various interviews, and how those recordings would not be used for public distribution, but rather as support for the investigation.

TAPE RECORDINGS

Although we conducted numerous interviews, we felt the three that were recorded were the most significant. Other interviews, in some cases, supported the original sightings. One tape recording was taken in private under the suspicion that the interviewees were being coached concerning the statements made and they did not wish to be given national publicity, but could be used for support of the investigation. A transcript accompanies the case.
