Dear Sir:

On the second Monday in the month of November, 1961, I saw a object gliding silently through the sky. This object had a green luminescent glow. There were photos of the "UFO". They all took in the light of this object. I am sending the photos and negative that might help you determine if it was a flying saucer. If you want to see the other negatives write back to me and I will send them to you.

Yours very truly,
(Signature redacted)

P.S. I am holding the best negative in case you do not answer back.
