AMERICAN UFO COMMITTEE
29 November, 1963

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, director
Dearborn Observatory
Northwestern University
Evanston, Ill.

Dear Dr. Hynek:

I have enclosed, as you requested, a full report of our meeting last month. A full discussion of the sighting was had, and I feel that you would be interested in the information we have discovered regarding this case.

Mr. agreed and myself, along with Dr. Ur, of the American Astronomical Society, were granted an interview with a membership of about 1,000. We plan to concentrate on "Fighting Flying Saucer" literature, and I shall be reporting to you on our progress.

Mr. Gregory told me to tell you that he has ordered a copy of the NICAP report on this incident. As you no doubt know by now, it is a matter of great public interest, and there have been many requests for information on Congress, as we know you are aware is how matters now stand.

If you have any questions on this incident please let me know. Thanking you for your interest, I am,

Sincerely yours,
