FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
Jan-Feb 66 
15 Sep 65 
PERU

The text on the page describes an incident where two shining oval-shaped objects were reportedly seen on the ground by a group of inhabitants in Huancabamba, Peru. The objects were described as being about 250 meters in diameter, and the inhabitants also found a kind of "soldier's water-bottle" near the objects. There are also mentions of other physical evidence found near the site, such as pieces of a substance resembling glass. The report states that the objects seemed to have landed in the district a few days prior to the incident being reported.
