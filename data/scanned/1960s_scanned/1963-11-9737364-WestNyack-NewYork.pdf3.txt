The image contains a diagram that appears to be a sketch or drawing. It shows an arc or horizon line with angular measurements and a radial design or compass rose-like element on the right side of the page.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Those marked "A" on the extreme high to low values should show the horizon (skyline) as you first saw it. Please show the position of the object (if any) when you first saw it. Please show the course over which the object moved as you observed it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion of the object or objects made. Indicate the end of the path and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? (Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.)
