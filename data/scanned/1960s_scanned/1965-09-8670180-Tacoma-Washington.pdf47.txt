TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

I was awakened about 12:15 AM 9-8-65 by a bright light coming in the window. At first I thought it was an airplane but as I watched it, I realized it was not an airplane. It was about the size of a DC6 and hovered silently about 1,000 feet up and 500 yards from the house. I watched it for about 10 minutes before it shot straight up and disappeared from sight. The night was very clear and the object was visible the entire time. I did not hear any sound from the object.
