The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing a UFO sighting report from Carcas, Venezuela on July 25th, 1965. The text describes an object that was seen from a window at the witness's home, which did not move quickly, instead moving in a straight line and weaving to the southwest before disappearing. The object was described as a brilliant point of white light that flew rapidly in an ellipse trajectory and then disappeared upwards.

Carcas, Venezuela, July 25th. Mr. Ismael Ramos Martines reported that on this date at 8.p.m. he saw a disc-shaped object from the window of his home at Guaicaipuro. He called his mother and sister who also saw the object and reported the object as an orange red, moving at a high velocity and estimated the sighting time at 5-7 minutes. The object did not speed, taking 6 or 7 minutes to cross the sky. It moved in a straight line, weaving to the southwest just before it veered sharply upward. Mr. Martines watched the sky until 10:30 p.m. but he then saw a fast-moving brilliant point of white light which flew from northeast to southeast. He called his sister and they watched the light as it flew rapidly in an ellipse trajectory. Then it disappeared upwards.
