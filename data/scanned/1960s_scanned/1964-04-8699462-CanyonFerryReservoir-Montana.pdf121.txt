780 four to the right 
a saucer was hovering over 
Canyon Ferry Reservoir. It 
had intense blue-green lights on 
the under, and they were pulsing
The saucer did seem to be a 
mechanical object with some 
structures & exhaust - seemingly
hover 120-150 yards above the water
for 15 to 20 minutes, then it 
ascended straight up and out of
sight to the north at high speed.
The saucer was totally silent - no
sound - as it hovered. It did give 
off a few small objects from it - they 
went down towards the water 
and appeared to drop into the lake.
Then the main craft went straight 
up and out of sight, at terrific speed.

The occurrence is well documented by 
S. Apr 21 - and we can forward a report 
to NICAP and get their view on this.
This will be explored for any extraterritorial,
military, or other explanation
