This page from the Project Blue Book document contains two images. The primary image is a compass-like diagram with a person standing at the center, surrounded by directional labels. The text states that this diagram should be used to indicate the direction of the observed phenomenon when it was first seen.

The second set of images shows two similar landscape scenes, one with a person standing in the center, and the other with a split view. The text states that these images are "not applicable - it was directly overhead, and did not occur with the observer."

Transcribing the text from the document:

AFR 80-17(C)
SA: NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

[Compass image]

Picture not applicable - it was directly overhead, and did not occur with the observer, come with it.
