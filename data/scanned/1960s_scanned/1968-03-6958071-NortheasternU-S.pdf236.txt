SUBJECT: UFO Sighting 3 March 68

Time: 3 March 68 (2210). Time was taken from an electric clock which is accurate.

DURATION: 45 Seconds

OBJECTS: 1

COLOR: Fire Color

SIZE: The front (ball) was about half the size of the full moon. 

BRIGHTNESS: About the brightness of the full moon (definitely brighter than Venus)

DIRECTION: The observer was facing south looking out the window. She said the object was coming toward her and that it was slightly larger than the moon was going down. She said she guessed so.

FIRST SEEN: SSE at about 45 degree elevation.

LAST SEEN: (Same general area) SSE at about 30 degree elevation.

COMMENTS: The observer said it was falling toward the earth at a slight angle and she felt that it would have hit in the wooded area south of her house. The object disappeared by burning out but slightly flared brighter. The object just glowed out. It was a few seconds (not too certain) from when it started to decrease in intensity till it blacked out completely. The observers husband also saw it.
