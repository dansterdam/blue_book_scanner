FLARES USED WITH REFUELING OPERATIONS:

SOURCE: NCOIC of REFUELING SQUADRON AT WPAFB

KC-97s carry M-4 flares for emergency use. These are used primarily when communications by radio are cut or the A/C to be refueled cannot locate the tanker A/C. The normal color is a two-ball yellow and green flare fired out of the rear of the A/C. The flare looks like a roman candle and falls in an arc descending. The duration can be up to 30 seconds. Red flares are carried also, but these are used in emergency only and not for identification of refueling operations.
