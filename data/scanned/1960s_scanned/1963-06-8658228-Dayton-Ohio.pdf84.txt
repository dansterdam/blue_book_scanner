There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document, with questions and space for handwritten answers.

20. Draw a picture to show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment, describe the results.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words common objects or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The text appears to be a questionnaire related to a reported UFO sighting, seeking detailed information about the observed object's motion, size, and disappearance.
