Optical character recognition (OCR) of the text found in the document:

I sighted out the object again and attempted to see it a little closer. Back in almost the same location as before. The object apparently appeared to float on their own on them. They were 3 feet away from each other. They disappeared shortly after, just the same way as before.

On these occasions my hand and watch frequently stopped or fluctuate a little uncertain. Ground a swayno (Ground radar, no change). This seems to be leaving a deep impression on the people concerned. Pacing Emergency Report. Wind velocity from West, velocity 5 to 10 mph, elevation approximately 30,000 feet, duration 3 to 4 at 9:00 p.m.

Respectfully,
