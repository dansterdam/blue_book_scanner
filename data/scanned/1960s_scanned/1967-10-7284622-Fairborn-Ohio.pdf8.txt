The image contains a sketch with instructions for the observer. The sketch depicts the horizon with the object's apparent position and movement. There are instructions to draw a picture that will show the motion of the object or objects, and to indicate the direction changes during the course. The image also contains a compass rose, which is commonly used for orientation. However, the image does not contain any photographs.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line that shows the horizon (skyline) where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the horizon where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a sketch of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
