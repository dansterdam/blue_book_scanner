Apparently to story concerning a possible UFO sighting made people anxious. It's expressed that there shouldn't be any concern or alarm over the matter, as the school has used the occasion to point out how difficult it is to make accurate observations, even under ideal conditions. The school is taking a sensible approach and not sensationalizing the incident. Please do not consider any report on this matter to be anything other than the school's desire to be completely factual and to avoid any appearance of exaggeration.
