1. Enclosed is a UFO received from a Mr.____ of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who seems to be a reliable source.

2. The information and this report is accompanied by 35 mm color slides and maps - also enclosed. We at Truax were unable to make an explanation of the sighting and could not see anything in the slides with the limited means available to us here. The slides are being forwarded in the hopes that more advanced photo interpretation methods may be able to glean some information from them.
