10,000+/- centigrade.

According to the area astronomers there are no astronomical bodies that could account for such a birth of flight. According to the weather people in Toronto, the sighting was lost to view, there was no interception or identification action taken. The Cleveland and Syracuse interceptors reportedly noting the objects in the general area during the day of sighting but could not confirm visual contact.

The only balloon release during the day or sighting would have been the regular 10 a.m. release of weather balloons from the Buffalo and Niagara Falls.

Preparing Officers - 2nd Lt. Frank C. Oberkoetter: Information Officers (Colorado) contacted with local astronomers in Buffalo and they could not offer any solution. Neither the towers at the Buffalo or Rochester Airports received any reports of any flights which could be correlated to the sighting. The usual flights in the area at that time (17 June) as two men saw an object, bluish in color, moving in an erratic path, then it disappeared, then all the information to identify the object sighted.

There are no existing physical pieces of evidence of any sort that I know of. None of the observers took pictures.
