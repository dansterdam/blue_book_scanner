UFO REPORT

Sebring, Florida

Date: 16 MAR 1967

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object

Summary: UFO Sighting - On the evening of March 16, 1967, at about 8:00 p.m., Mr. Robert Ward was observed a large, brightly lighted object in the sky over his home. The object appeared to be hovering and then began to move rapidly to the north-west. At the same time, Mr. Ward's dog began to bark and act very nervous. The object was described as round, with bright lights around the entire periphery. The sighting lasted for about 15 minutes.

When Mr. Ward first observed the object, he immediately called his wife and son to also observe it. All three members of the family watched the object for the duration of the sighting. Mr. Ward stated that the object appeared to be about twice the size of a full moon and was very brilliantly lighted, with the lights seeming to pulsate. At one point, the object appeared to be surrounded by a hazy glow. The object then moved rapidly to the north-west and was soon out of sight.

Mr. Ward stated that he had never seen anything like this before and that he was quite startled by the sighting. He felt that the object was under intelligent control and not an airplane or any other known type of aircraft. This report is being forwarded for your information.
