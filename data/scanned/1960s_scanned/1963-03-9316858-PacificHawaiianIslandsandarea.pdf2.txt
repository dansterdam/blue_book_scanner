MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBJECT ZOOMS OVER HAWAIIAN ISLES
HONOLULU, Mar. 13 (UPI) - An unidentified flying object was seen over a large section of the Hawaiian islands last night, newspapers and radio stations were flooded with calls.
Capt. Paul Steucke of the Honolulu Sector Command of the National Guard said the object was possibly a rocket or some sort of space object flying at a predetermined course. He said the object was first thought to be a jet at a very high altitude, but then noticed that it left a vapor trail.
HAWAII - March 11, 1963 - The sighting of an unidentified object over the Hawaiian islands is still being investigated by the State Adjutant General's office. Residents of the islands, including tourists, still have not forgotten the incident of February 28 when a UFO was sighted over the Barbers Point area near Honolulu. The object, estimated to be several hundred feet in length, was observed by literally thousands of witnesses, including a number of National Guard pilots who were aloft at the time on a routine training mission. The object appeared to be a bright, reddish-colored, elliptical-shaped craft, and it maneuvered at an extremely high rate of speed.
On March 12th, a high rate of speed was again reported by hundreds of witnesses as the UFO travelled over the Hawaiian islands. National Guard pilots said they had visual contact with the object and that it was far exceeding the speed of any jet aircraft. Newspapers and radio stations were flooded with calls.
