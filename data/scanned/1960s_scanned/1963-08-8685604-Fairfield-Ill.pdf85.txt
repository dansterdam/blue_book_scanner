WAYNE COUNTY PRESS, MONDAY 19 AUGUST 1963

SIGHTINGS IN SKY
APPEAR ON WAYNE

Some Reported in County Over 
Week-End, Others in Other 
Counties.

Are Wayne County Residents
Witness to-the-sky activity as 
strange as they describe? Recent 
reports from Wayne and adjoining 
counties indicate that there is.

Last police-reported sighting in 
the Fairfield area was Wednesday 
night. The object, described as a 
large, bright light, was sighted on 
several occasions around Fairfield 
over the week and is attracting 
considerable attention.

Last Tuesday evening a large ob
ject, described as a star-like light, 
was reported by several persons 
in the Fairfield area. It was ob
served for several minutes and 
then disappeared. 

Early last Saturday morning a 
Fairfield man, who asked to re
main anonymous, reported seeing 
a strange lighted object in the 
sky. He said it appeared to be 
about half the size of the full 
moon and was a greenish-yellow 
color. He observed it for about 
five minutes as it moved slowly 
across the sky, he said.

At Mt. Vernon, Ill., a Fairfield 
man reported seeing a strange ob
ject in the sky which he said was 
a bright star-like object which re
mained stationary in the sky for 
about five minutes, then suddenly 
disappeared.

CLAIM AIR FORCE 
KEEPS LID ON UFOS

Representatives From Private Or
ganizations Contend There Is 
Suppression of Evidence.

A claim that the U. S. Air Force 
is suppressing evidence about un
identified flying objects was made 
Saturday night by representatives 
from private organizations study
ing UFOs.

The claim was made during a 
televised interview when the repre
sentatives contended that the Air 
Force has identified over 700 UFOs 
but has kept most of the evidence 
secret. They said the Air Force's 
official policy of denying evidence 
of UFOs is "inherently dangerous".

The representatives, who identi
fied themselves as members of the 
National Investigations Committee 
on Aerial Phenomena and the 
Aerial Phenomena Research Or
ganization, said the Air Force has 
been with Time Magazine. It 
is a "complex phenomenon" with 
more than 12,000 reported cases 
on 6,000 files of UFO sightings, 
most of the reports still top 
secret.

"Inherently Dangerous"
The NICAP board of directors 

said the Air Force has been with
holding information and sup
pressing evidence of UFO ac
tivity from the public. Air Force 
Col. Robert Friend, an intelli
gence officer, denied the NICAP 
charges and said the Air Force 
has been open about all evidence.

A publicity release from NICAP 
said the Air Force denies high
quality, multiple-witness UFO 
cases, such as the recent sighting 
in the Far East.
