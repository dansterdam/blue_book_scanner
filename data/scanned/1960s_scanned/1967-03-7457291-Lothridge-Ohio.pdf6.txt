There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document. It seems to be a handwritten narrative describing a UFO sighting.

TRANSCRIPT:

It was about 9:10 P.M. March 7, 1967 that my husband and I were driving down a country road. I was looking to the right and I saw a bright object with a white light on top and 2 white lights (one on each end).

It looked like it was about 30 feet long. I couldn't tell how wide but it was definitely not round. And the lights was a perfect circle (about once per second). And the light would seem to dim and then brighten. The object seemed to be hovering over the plane. It was quite a distance until the plane was directly under it. Then the light would seem to dim and then brighten. The object seemed to be just hovering there. I don't think they saw the object. I was telling my husband but he didn't seem too excited about it. Be seemed to think it was just reflecting. I saw this for about 30 seconds.
