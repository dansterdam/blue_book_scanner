There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report. 

The text in the document reads as follows:

(1) Captain Donald D. Dettloff, AD 3033215, Assistant Base Operations Officer, 4602d Air Defense Wing, Colorado Springs, Colorado.

(2) The following agencies were contacted in an attempt to obtain additional reports on the sightings: 
 
(a) Denver ARTC. This agency checked their radar and flight logs for the period 0050Z to 0115Z.

(b) Colorado State Patrol.

(c) Local Law Enforcement Agencies in Colorado Springs, Broadmoor, Garden of the Gods, Garden of the Gods Park, Cheyenne Mountain Park, Pueblo, Canon City, and Salida.

(3) A complete survey was made in turn contacting all fire towers and ranger stations in the area.

(4) FAA contacted towers at Peterson Field and Pueblo Municipal, Pueblo.

(5) The lodge manager on top of Pikes Peak and the toll gate operators for the road leading to the top of the peak.

(6) In addition to the above checks the North American Air Defense Command Operations and Facility Center was contacted. They indicated there was no unusual activity at that time that could have caused the sightings.

(7) The sightings correlated with red "X"s to indicate direction and distance, but produced little additional information.

(8) Preliminary analysis of the sightings:
 
(a) The film taken from all five witnesses leaves little doubt that the objects were present. However, the film may prove inconclusive as to the true nature of the objects.
 
(b) The objects did not demonstrate any flight patterns or maneuvers that are not possibleto modern aircraft.
 
(c) No one else had seen these objects before, although several individuals felt they had seen similar objects on previous occasions. The other witnesses, however, could not confirm these earlier sightings.
