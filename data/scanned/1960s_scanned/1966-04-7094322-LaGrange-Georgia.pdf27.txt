The text in the document is as follows:

"The Broad Street Dormitory, LaGrange College, LaGrange, Georgia, is located west of the main entrance of the college campus. The building, which was formerly a hospital, is a three-story structure with a brick exterior and a tile roof. There is a small alley which has numerous houses and high trees on both sides. A small bank of trees faces the street on the south side of the building. The building and the alley are on the north side of the Broad Street hill. Screens were on the windows. Visual scrutiny of the area where the UFO's were observed could not be obtained from within the dormitory above the line of trees with the present trees appearing to be partially effective visual screens. Three sketches are appended to this report as Attachment 3 for reference."

"14. On 4 April 1966, 2255 (7:55 p.m.) Sgt ROBERT RAY 21831, Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, LaGrange Air Force Station, LaGrange, Georgia, was interviewed and stated in substance: Several small single engine aircraft and two twin engine aircraft were observed landing on the runway at the Callaway Airport, LaGrange, Georgia. Two jet aircraft were also observed overflying the field at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. Only the landing and takeoff of the small aircraft were reportedly observed. Military aircraft are frequently in the area and on occasions remain overnight, causing additional speculation by the local residents. The weather was good and visibility was approximately 15 miles. Sgt RAY was unable to offer any possible explanation for the several UFO sightings reportedly observed in the area on the night of 6 April 1966."

"15. On 6 April 1966, 2326 (11:26 p.m.)  ...Cpl FRED ANDERSON, 31457723, Det (S), 6903 Radio Relay Squadron, USAF, Columbus, Georgia, was interviewed. He stated that he had observed three unidentified objects southwest of Columbus, Georgia, during the period from 2030 to 2115 hours (8:30 p.m. to 9:15 p.m.), 6 April 1966. The objects appeared to be larger than stars, red in color, and were hovering or stationary. They could have been aircraft but were much larger than any aircraft which could have been in the area, according to Cpl ANDERSON. He stated he observed them through 7 x 50 binoculars and that the sighting lasted for approximately 45 minutes."
