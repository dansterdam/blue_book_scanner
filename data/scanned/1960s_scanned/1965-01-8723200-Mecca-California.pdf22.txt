Attached is a color photo OF a UFO submitted to this office FOR AF's EVALUATION. It appears to have been submitted to this office recently by Mr. Clifford C. BURMONT, of Mecca, Calif, about 65 miles east of Los Angeles near the American Canal, east of Mecca, Calif. According to Mr. BURMONT, Calif., he did not see the UFO itself but said he heard a rumbling sound immediately after he saw a flash. He estimated the time as approximately 8:30 am, PST, on 4 Aug 1965. He took the photo on Ektachrome color film. He estimated the diameter of the object as approximately 200 feet, bell-shaped. He estimated the altitude at approximately 2,500 feet.

Can you please reply directly to Mr. BURMONT on his UFO report and advise on what would appropriate for a copy of its disposition?

Incidentally, has a SAFOI Fact Sheet on UFOs been published since the one dated 15 Jan 1960? If so I also would like a copy and any other material available.
