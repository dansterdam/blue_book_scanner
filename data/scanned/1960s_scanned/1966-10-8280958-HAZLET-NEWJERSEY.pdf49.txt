There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten letter describing a UFO sighting.

Dear Gentlemen:
I am the boy who witnessed the sighting on October 10. The umidentified observation. he was on Friday night October 6 that I saw it. I was coming home from watching TV 
it to you instantly, but my cousin noticed it first. Hamilton, Ohio, and told me about it. Within 10 minutes, he had seen it too. 
within 20 minutes, he had seen it 
minutes form when he had first observed it.
He estimated it was about 30 feet from all of the corners of the building. He called me at strange sight, large and round in years.
The main reason I am writing this is because I spend many hours watching these things. I have never seen anything like this before. Watching these U.F.O.'s, I would like them do their crazy light is a sight to see. But the most disturbing questions come to me. Are these U.F.O.'s come down or a play with us and disappear.
