TAC G-13 On 4 August at 12302 (approximately) the crew of a T-33 jet saw a bright light altitude, high speed UFO pass directly overhead on a heading of 060 degrees. The object was 12-15 degrees of arc in apparent size and was a bright light. (1) Can station November sighted the same object and reported that it lit up the whole sky as it passed overhead. (2) Investigation revealed that it was probably an Atlas missile fired from Vandenberg AFB. The bright light over ocean station November was probably the light from a flash which followed the launching of the Atlas missile. This was much brighter and larger in apparent size than the sighting reported by the aircraft. However, the aircraft saw not only the light but also some of the missile flight time. Therefore, I believe the sighting and the missile flight were one and the same. d. On 5 August, at 13112, several aircraft at 28-33N/I 45W reported a strange flashing object which climbed rapidly and flew into the clouds. On 5 August at 05002, a teenager reported a bright light in the sky since no other details were available, this sighting was ruled non-significant and no investigation was made.
