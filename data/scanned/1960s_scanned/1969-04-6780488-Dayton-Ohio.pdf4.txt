April 7,1969

Dear Sirs:

I am an amateur astronomer and would like for your department to give me an explanation for a UFO sighting I made on the evening of April 7,1969. The objects were traveling in a pair and were quite close together (barely observable with the naked eye but telescopic observations confirmed that there were two objects). I was doing my homework when I looked out my window and saw a very bright object moving very slowly. When I looked again, it had disappeared. I always keep my telescope ready in my bedroom and I went "outside on my porch (for it was 72" outside and I wanted less distraction) and I took out my telescope and pointed it at the area where I had seen the object disappear. It's course was for about 10 or 15 seconds and I pushed inside to get my telescope and mounted it on the porch. It is an EAL astronomical mounting and I swing with ease. Under 35x the two objects were clearly defined. They were points of light yet their visual magnitude was brighter than -3. It outshone Jupiter easily from where I was looking. After it had travelled a of the distance of its course, it began to fluctuate in magnitude, gradually diminish as it traveled its course. After it had passed 3/4 of its course, it began to fluctuate violently in magnitude but still remained in sight. If was about 35 degrees above the horizon looking to the east. It traveled along its path for approximately two minutes before vanishing toward Alloth. When it vanished, it did so gradually, telescope still trained on it.
