The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

A new object is finally disappear; it made a peculiar southernly direction, it then seemed to slow down and disappear below the horizon, the object, once it started to disappear, seemed to be blinking in an irregular manner.

"AS IT TURNED TOWARDS THE EAST, I COULD OBSERVE IT CLEARLY, LIKE A BALLOON, TUBE, OR CYLINDER AT ANY TIME WHEN IT WAS NOT OBSCURED BY CLOUDS."
