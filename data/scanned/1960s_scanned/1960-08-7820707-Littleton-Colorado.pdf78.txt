At approximately 7:30 p.m., on August 8, 1960, near Littleton, Colorado. They observed a bright light, round in shape, approximately 10-15 feet in diameter, at an estimated height of 1,500 feet above the ground. 

The light made a slight humming sound, and seemed to oscillate or emit a pulsating light. It was observed for a period of approximately 2 minutes, and then suddenly disappeared. The witnesses stated that the object did not seem to just go out, but rather appeared to accelerate at a high rate of speed and was gone in an instant.
