On the evening of July 23, 1967, at approximately 6:44 p.m. I had been watching cloud formations to the west of my home when a bright orange object appeared in the sky. It was round in shape and slightly larger than a basketball when viewed at arm's length. It made no sound and appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 500 ft. I watched the object for about 2 minutes as it moved in a straight line from southwest to northeast. It then appeared to increase in speed and altitude and disappeared from sight. There were no other witnesses to this sighting as far as I know. My wife was in the house at the time and did not see the object. The sky was clear and the sun was still above the horizon when I observed this occurrence. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and reflected the sunlight as it moved across the sky. I have had an interest in astronomy for many years and this was the first unidentified flying object I have ever observed.
