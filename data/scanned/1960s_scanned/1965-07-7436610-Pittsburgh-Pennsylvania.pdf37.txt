The object's height was 9 feet, including what appeared to be its protruding from the bottom. The craft displayed a greenish-gray color. There was a hollow in the top that could have been a dome. 
This claim comes from the landing of the dogs. However, when the object took off a few seconds later, a yellowish glow appeared beneath it, and a whistling sound - which Crowe could not attach to any conventional aircraft - was heard. After the reaction of Manly. Strangely enough, as soon as the object was in the air, the dogs suddenly stopped barking.
From various parts of Australia during late July and early August, at least one photograph was taken.
