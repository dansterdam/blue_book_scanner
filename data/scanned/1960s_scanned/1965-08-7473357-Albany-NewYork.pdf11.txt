On August 0, 1965 at approximately 9:15 p.m. while observing the night sky, a witness living in Loananda, NY made a sighting of several silvery objects. A sketch made from the observation was submitted to the UFO newspaper. She said they made no noise, and were at very low altitude, moving southward at high speed. Each was five or six feet across, according to her estimate.
