COMMENTS OF INVESTIGATING OFFICER

Mrs. [redacted] indicated she sighted the object from her car when returning home at approximately 2:30 hours. She did not stop or take any further action as she was in a hurry. She claimed the object was suspended at an approximate 45 degree angle, 1000 to 2000 feet in the distance and remained stationary for some time. She made it clear on several occasions that she did not believe in flying saucers and was quite convinced as to what she had observed. To investigate such objects, she had to repeat two or three times what called her attention to this object and each time the answer was the same.

Summary: I drove down the route she traveled; this route has large trees overhanging from both sides of the road and at one time or another the trees would have definitely obscured her vision. It is interesting that she could identify the object and make such detailed observations. She appeared nervous throughout the questioning. It is my opinion that her sighting is either exaggerated or fictitious, and I would not recommend any further action or investigation.
