Secretary of Defense
Washington 25, D.C.

Sir:

I thought of a new organization to help our defenses in one way or another and it is very much like the organization the Sky Watchers are except the sky watchers will watch for ICBM's and rockets etc. and I have formed an organization of my own.

The organization is called the "Aerial Observers". We will train men and women to go on the streets and watch the sky and report any strange objects or ICBM's or rockets to the local authorities and the President with full details about what they have seen. It was started about 7 weeks ago.

They will have men and women with telescopic lens to take movies or any pictures that can be obtained. The local authorities will be notified and they can take further action.
I will appreciate very much if you will look into this matter. 

Sincerely

Vernon, Texas
