The image contains a table with chemical analysis data for three samples. There is no photograph present in this image.

The text in the document is as follows:

The three pieces of sample #2 were analyzed separately, and a comparison of the relative intensities of the emission lines from these pieces is given below.

Element     22a°     25°     26°
Rb             23c     2.5     9-. 
Ba             53     10.3    0.
Sr             33      6.3    1.
Cu             50     10.     10.
Nl             1.2     0.     9.
Mn             8.8     0.     0.
Fe              0       0      0.

This table is normalized to Cu is = 10, and indicates that Sample 2b contains a more uniform concentration of Barium than the others, and the others contain no Manganese.
