The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a project record card from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The card documents an observation of some type of object on January 17, 1961 near Troy, Ohio. The "Type of Observation" indicates it was observed visually and by radar. The "Brief Summary of Sighting" describes a light that crossed the sky and "exploded" without any sound. The "Conclusions" section provides more details about the observation, noting that the object was reported to have returned and exploded and that attempts were made to contact witnesses, though the report is categorized as "Insufficient Data".
