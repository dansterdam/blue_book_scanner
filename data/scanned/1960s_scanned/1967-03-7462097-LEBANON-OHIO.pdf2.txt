ATLINED FOR THE RECORD

9 Oct, 1967
Nicholas Manakas (works somewhere on base) says he has additional information on both the 20th Sept. 67 Tipp City Case and the March 67 Lebanon (Ohio) sightings. However he would not reveal this info. to the case officer unless Gen. Goldworthy was present. We were unable to meet these conditions.
