Dear Major Quintanilla,
This report is dated 8/27/66 and concerns a sighting that occurred on 8/24/66 in Harvard, Massachusetts.
SIGHTINGS CASE NO: 6-6-66 CATEGORY I
LOCATION: Harvard, Massachusetts
WEATHER: Clear, Project Blue Book Case
Dear Major Quintanilla,
This report is being forwarded to your office, along with an enclosure, for any evaluating you might wish to perform in connection with the investigation of this sighting.
About 11:30 p.m., 24 Aug 1966, a resident of Harvard, Massachusetts, a civilian, phoned the American Legion Post in Harvard, and reported sighting an unidentified object in the sky. The control officer there notified the local State Police about the sighting.
The witness, who was driving home on a country road about 2 miles from Harvard, stated that he saw a brightly lighted, oval object hovering over a field at an estimated altitude of 500 feet. The object was observed for about 5 minutes and then it suddenly accelerated and disappeared. The witness described the object as 20 to 25 feet in diameter, with a bright blue-white light around the rim, and a series of flashing lights in the center.
I have talked with the witness and find his report to be credible. He appears to be a reliable individual and his story is consistent. I am enclosing a copy of the State Police report for your information.
Sincerely,
Hector J. Quintanilla Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
