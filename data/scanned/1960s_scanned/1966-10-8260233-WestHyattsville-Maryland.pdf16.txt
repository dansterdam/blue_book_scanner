Transcription of the text in the document:

In whom 24 May 1966

I have been studying the reports of the mysterious maneuvers and landings by what appears to be the "U.F.O.'s" coming the Gat est.

I believe many people have expressed their views on these maneuvers and they have been trying to clarify the misunderstanding of such maneuvers.

Many thanks for your interest.

Sincerely yours,
