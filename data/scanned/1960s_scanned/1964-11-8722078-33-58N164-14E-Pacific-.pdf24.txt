NO CASE INFORMATION ONLY, 19 NOV 64 ITALY
ALSO OTHER BACK DATES

Dear Mr. _____,

Thank you very much for your recent letter regarding UFO sightings in Italy. I apologize for the delay in answering, but I hope you will understand that the work involved in investigating the many reports received in this office is very time consuming. 

Blue Book, the Air Force agency for the investigation of UFO objects, is aware of the official position of the Italian government on this subject. It is 16 years of investigating over 9,000 reports of unidentified flying objects, a considerable portion of which have been sighted, investigated and explained by qualified technical observers. However, a significant percentage remain unexplained.

Air Force investigators continue to study the relatively small number of cases, like this one, where UFO reported characteristics may indicate some evidence of unusual or unconventional characteristics beyond the normal experience of flight and known laws of science.

Difficulties or delays in the release of UFO data are often due to the necessity of protecting certain classified information or technical sources and methods. It would be extremely difficult for us to try to undertake a full investigation of this case with the limited data provided.

I am in touch with the Assistant Air Attache in Rome for further information regarding this sighting. He has been informed of your interest and cooperation in this matter is appreciated.
