P.O. (2212)
T.R. Mahon, Airman LED, Ohio 45123 
2 April 1965

Mr. George Cannon 
U.S. Defense Road
Lynx Addition, Ohio

Dear Sir,

The object that was submitted to the Air Force at Wright-
Patterson AFB was tested at the Air Technical Intelligence
Center. A report on the test results is attached. While no
identifiable evidence or the object was found, tests con-
ducted indicate the object was of unknown origin and
did not exhibit evidence of space residence. The sphere
is being returned to you under separate cover.

In expressing your patriotic duty as an American citizen in
submitting this object to the Air Force for analysis.

Sincerely,

MAJOR QUINTANILLA, JR.
