The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document, possibly a report or summary from Project Blue Book, discussing an investigation of a purported high-speed object observed in the sky. The document describes attempts made to gain access to the "photo lab" and obtain any photographs that may have been taken, but it seems no photographs were ultimately obtained. The text is detailed and provides information about the investigation and the reasons why no photographic evidence was available.

The film was permitted at technical and that to paid the normal price to have this film processed.
