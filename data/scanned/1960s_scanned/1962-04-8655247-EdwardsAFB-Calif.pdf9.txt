Building Best Enlisted Leadership is Role of Senior NCO Academy
Since the Air Force officer training programs or education through the Senior NCO Academy have grad-uated thousands of officers, it is only natural that the enlisted leaders in the Air Force should be given particular attention. The NCO Academy located at Perrin AFB in Albuquerque, N.M., is an outstanding example of the leadership training given to the NCO.
At the NCO Academy, selected leaders are trained to handle their affairs and responsibilities as senior NCO who have a vital part of administering the Air Force. While all NCO's receive some professional training, the Academy is set aside to give in-depth instruction in administration, personnel, supply, operations training, and other technical and supervisory skills.  
Approximately 1,000 students are trained during the 12-week course offered each quarter by the academy. Students are chosen from among the senior NCO's with the best background of experience, leadership, and military knowledge. This course gives them the opportunity to broaden their knowledge and master skills for the benefit of the Air Force.
Physical fitness is an important part of Academy life. Each student must meet certain physical standards to enter the course and while undergoing training they are kept busy with drill, exercise, and sports. This program develops the physical condition necessary for NCO leadership.
The first class of 25 master sergeants entered the Academy in January 1957. Since then more than 5,200 senior NCO's have graduated. The Academy has been instrumental in providing the Air Force with its most outstanding and effective NCO leadership. Graduates are in demand worldwide and are assigned to key leadership positions in major commands. Upon graduation, they receive promotion to higher grades. The Academy program is considered so important that major commands are authorized to send promising NCO's to the Academy for training.
