1. We have something which the evaluation "possible" uncovered. It is all a question that can go in taking the above's testimony more or less at face value. It is interesting that two independent witnesses were in good agreement as to certain details. So much so that I believe still a third time, then said that it flashed and flicked, and both said that it last 15 minutes. If we make their composite testimony, then the direction of motion is unbekable. It can be adopted only if we severely discount statements that statement that it liked red and green alternately around.

2. I don't know where Bellevue, Ohio, is but I would suggest that next time it am in Dayton I make a point of investigating these witnesses even if only by phone. I think particularly on the length of time supposedly still. I believe this is a crucial point and if certainties that its standing still was the result of radial motion, one thin, how five minutes, then we have a substantial air observation in any case, identified, would apply for the moment until further interrogation.
