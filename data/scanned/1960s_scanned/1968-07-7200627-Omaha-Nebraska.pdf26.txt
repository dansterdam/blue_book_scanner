While by 1 18-year old observed two very bright, near overhead lights, suddenly appear, nearly overhead they stated it was ISO feet in diameter and brii':ly overhead then disappeared, noticed by wife. Hynek's experiment with boys in cornfield some days ago on similar objects on ground and green lights in back indicated outside aircraft of some kind, but this pass by could have been stars as it passed.
