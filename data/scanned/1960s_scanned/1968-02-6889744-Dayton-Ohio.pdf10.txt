The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with a form-like questionnaire. The text in the image reads:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: ___ Day ___ Month ___ Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
