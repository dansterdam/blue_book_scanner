NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

FEBRUARY 1963
PIEVE DI CADORE, ITALY

PIEVE DI CADORE, ITALY, a young painter named Painter Mario Salmaso, 21, claims he saw a luminous object and a man nearby in a plastic suit which was transparent. He did not attempt to make physical contact with the object. The sightings were made in February. He says he was walking near some woods when he saw a huge, round luminous object. He claims that there have not been any of these pictures, which must be quite sensational if they existed.
