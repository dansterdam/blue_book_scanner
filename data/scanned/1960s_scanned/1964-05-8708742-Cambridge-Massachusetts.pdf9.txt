1. We have received a letter from Professor Paul F. Rowe of the Massachusetts Research Foundation, 55 Iovonia Street, Brookline, Massachusetts, concerning a UFO sighting.

2. We are forwarding his letter to the Air Force consultant for Project Blue Book, Doctor J. Allen Hynek, for evaluation since he is well acquainted with the cause of the sighting. 

3. It is requested that you inform me of the result of this referral.

4. It is possible that Doctor Hynek is acquainted with the observer due to their Smithsonian/NASA association during the satellite tracking program.
