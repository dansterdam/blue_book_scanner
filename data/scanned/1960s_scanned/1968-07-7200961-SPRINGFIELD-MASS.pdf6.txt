Dear Sir,
The report on a UFO which you will read following this paragraph has been sent to you a little late. Because why it is being sent to you a little late is as follows: I had originally sent this report to Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland, and received an answer that this week later. They had sent the address of "Project Blue Book" and said that investigation of unusual aerial phenomena has been the responsibility of the United States Air Force and to direct my inquiries to you.
An exact report on the UFO which my father and myself observed is contained in the following part of this letter.
The night of the Twentieth of July at approximately 11:00 PM, my father and myself had just stepped outside of our car when I noticed an unusually bright object in the stars (as it seemed). As I observed this stubby cylindrical-shaped object I called my father and asked him if it was just an illusion or was this object really moving. He answered and said that it was moving and without any apparent sound.
This object was of an apparent to be of a fantastic altitude and moving at an amazing rate of speed with a very small tail and an appearance in brightness and also six times that of any star I could see. After watching the UFO for about ten minutes, it disappeared.
