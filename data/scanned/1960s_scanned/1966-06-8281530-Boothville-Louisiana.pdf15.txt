14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The witness stated that the object did not disappear, but rather "it seemed to be at a long distance and gradually diminish in size until I could no longer see it at all."

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The witness selected "Yes" to indicate the object moved behind something, but did not specify what it was.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The witness selected "Yes" to indicate the object moved in front of something, but did not specify what it was.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - "like a humming at all!"
b. Color - "light yellow"
c. Size - "about the size of a star"

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object's surface is covered by the match stick. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match stick?
The witness stated the object "seemed to be at a long distance and gradually diminish in size until I could no longer see it at all" and provided the approximate size as "about the size of a star", indicating the angular size was quite small.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you are such as color, approximate size, and any unusual trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The witness provided a hand-drawn sketch showing an elongated, cigar-shaped object with a pointed tip at one end and a trailing effect behind it, indicating the object was moving. The witness described the object as "lighted up" and stated it "seemed to be at a long distance and gradually diminish in size until I could no longer see it at all."
