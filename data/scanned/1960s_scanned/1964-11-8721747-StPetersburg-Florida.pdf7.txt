SUBJECT: UFO Sightings, November 1964, Florida

TO:  Hq USAF SAFOI FB (Mrs Hunt) 
WASH D C 20330

1. Reference the attached letter from Joan Whitemour and Mrs Helen G Hartmann pertaining to unidentified flying objects.

2. The following is a suggested reply:

We have received your reports from 5-20 Nov 64 regarding various observations of satellite-like objects.

On the limited data presented for each observation it is impossible to make a firm statement as to the cause of each sighting. However, the characteristics presented do not indicate that these sightings could not have been caused by the passage of various satellites and/or high flying aircraft.

In reporting observations a certain minimum amount of information is required for evaluation. This includes a description of the object, duration of the sighting and the time motion sequence if others reported any motion.

These objects reported may or may not be caused by the same phenomena. It is unlikely that all of the sightings are actual UFOs. The definite curves (not an illusion) have significant periods of time, were accurately reported, and the echo schedule for November are available.

The characteristics presented do not indicate a balloon observation: meteorological sightings or other phenomena; however, it is difficult to determine how the witness can state that the object was definitely not an airplane.
