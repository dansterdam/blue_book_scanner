A huge triangular, as big as a house, with lights on the corners and flashing. Most unusual, no sound, no motion. This was not a conventional aircraft.

21. DID YOU NOTICE ANY ODOR, NOISE, OR EMANATION FROM THE PHENOMENA OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF, ANIMALS, OR INSTRUMENTS? DESCRIBE IN DETAIL.

(Handwritten Text)
A surprising sound, as if a strange machine, and it left no physical evidence. I didn't touch the ground.

I didn't take care. If I 800 flight off the ground.
