There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from what appears to be a project blue book document with a sketch and some handwritten text.

The handwritten text on the page says:

"In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

There is also a sketch with labels "A" and "B" on a curved line and a compass.
