The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

SUMMARY
State your own personal evaluation of the report. What do you think the object was? Do you think something other than the sighting motivated the caller? Include your evaluation of the caller's reliability.

ACCORDING TO THE CALLER'S DESCRIPTION:
HE DID PHOTOGRAPH SOME TYPE OF OBJECT, RATHER THAN AN OPTICAL ILLUSION. I WOULD NOT HOWEVER, CONCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF UNCONVENTIONAL SHAPES OR MIDDLE COLORS. I DID NOT FORM ANY OPINION *OF SOME OTHER MOTIVATION FOR CALLING.
I DID NOT ONE APPARENT CONTRADICTION; HE SAID HE WAS JUST PHOTOGRAPHING A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET, YET HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOS SOUNDS TO ME LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE, IN FACT, BEEN SHOOTING AT THE OBJECTS.
I WOULD APPRECIATE HEARING WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS REPORT IS AND WHAT ACTION (IF ANY) IS TAKEN.
