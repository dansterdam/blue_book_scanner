Dear Sir

About two weeks ago my neighbor and I saw a phenomenon. We both had a difficult time but there were no more than three or three and a half minutes. we called the other neighbors and two or three came back toward us. Soon after that it turned back and went up in the sky. It was a brilliant light and three or four times the size of the moon. It passed through that area and when it got up to the tree, it go out of sight.

I hope this will cast some light on it for you.

Sincerely
Arnold
