10,000 in the United States alone for the period 1947 through 1965, were designated by Dr. Donald H. Menzel, Director of the Harvard University Observatory, as "a heterogeneous collection of facts, fiction, and guesses." The Air Force indicates that reports of unfamiliar objects in the sky have been made by a wide range of observers - military and civilian pilots, amateur astronomers, housewives, etc.

Description of Various Types of UFOs:
Descriptions of UFOs often are inadequate for subsequent explanation due to the conditions under which the sighting was made, the qualifications of the observer, or the difficulty of translating the elements of the sighting into meaningful terms. Basic descriptive data usually are expressed in these categories (with examples):

Shape (cigar, propeller, aircraft, disc)
Size (various widely) 
Color (various) 
Motion (hovering, supersonic, vertical, zigzag)
Means of propulsion (unknown - flaming exhaust or none; various noises or silent) 
Structures (may or might; seldom over water or touching the earth)
Disappearance (unknown; apparently solid to "invisible")

Trends in UFO Activity:
Experience derived from nearly twenty years (post-1947) of UFO sighting activity indicates that activity may be reported in "waves" of observations, sometimes in a localized area. The activity in Europe in 1946, in the United States in 1952, and the high number of sightings in 1957 after the launching of Sputnik reflect such patterns (see Figure 1). In the aftermath of the Sputnik I launching in October of 1957, official.
