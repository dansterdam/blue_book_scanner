Please verify a report covering an unidentified flying object, Sebring, Florida, on August 7, 1967.

What were you doing when this sighting occurred?
My wife and I were driving on Highway 27, returning home to Sebring, Florida, from Avon Park, Florida, approximately 8:00 P.M. on August 7, 1967.

What did you see?
As we were driving, we saw an object in the sky. Can you describe the object?
The object was stationary, hovering in the sky, about 10 to 15 degrees from the horizon. It was round, and white in color, and appeared to be metallic. It seemed to be about the size of a car. What did you think it was?
We thought it was an aircraft or some type of UFO. Why did you think it was a UFO?
Because of the way it was hovering and the way it disappeared. It did not seem to move like an aircraft.

What did you do when you saw the object?
We pulled the car over to the side of the road to get a better look at it. The car then stalled and the lights went out. Did you see or hear anything else?
We heard a humming sound coming from the object. She tried to start the car several times but it would not start.

What happened then?
I thought the object was not a plane because it hovered and then disappeared rapidly down to the low horizon and the law. I thought at first that it might be a missile because it moved so rapidly, but it did not seem to be a missile either, and it hovered in one position for some time. We did not see or hear a helicopter, but we had heard a helicopter that was out in that area earlier.
