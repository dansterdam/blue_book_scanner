2. Captain Dewan report that he and his co-pilot observed an unidentified object while enroute to Sault Ste Marie Airport from Detroit. Approximate time of observation was 1800 EST. They observed a very bright white light that appeared to be hovering. The object was in their sight for approximately 1 minute. It appeared to be a half mile to three fourths mile distant and at an altitude of about 1000 feet. The object then accelerated and disappeared.

3. A check with local radar sites and air force activities revealed that no aircraft of a military or civilian nature were known to be in that area at that time.

The UFO questionnaire - form 14D was not possible.
