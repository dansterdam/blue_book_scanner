Dear Captain Quintanilla,

Reference is made to my phone call this morning. I have talked to Major Casper who was the Cloud Gap Special Operations Officer at Albuquerque, based at Kirtland AFB, during the time this incident took place. Cloud Gap operations were conducted in an area about a hundred miles north of Socorro, New Mexico. Cloud Gap personnel did not have any information for special lighting which would possibly have led to the description provided by police officer Lonnie Zamora.

Since certain aerial surveillance flights were being conducted by Navy aircraft, IA 50's, in the area in question, a check on such flights revealed none were flown on 24 April 1964 in connection with Cloud Gap.

We have no information on this sighting other than that provided by your SGT MOODY who was a participant on our project and that picked up from the newspapers.

I have enclosed an article found in the Los Angeles Times of 20 May which may be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

KENNETH A. YOUNG
Colonel, USAF
