Dear Sir:

On two recent evenings - April 3 and 11 - beginning at about members of my family observed a bright, stationary object about 45 minutes near my home some 9 miles southwest of Camden, Ohio.

At first sighting, this object resembled a brilliant, low-hanging, grayish-white light. It remained in view for about 45 minutes, then, assuming a reddish glow, disappeared over the horizon in a northwesterly direction.  

I merely mention it in passing, and don't know whether any relationship or not, but some cheap carts are housed in our backyard close to where this phenomena occurred.

According to reports, others in Preble County, Ohio, and Indiana have seen the same, or other similar object. I would be discuss the matter further, should you care to contact me at the above address.

Yours truly,
