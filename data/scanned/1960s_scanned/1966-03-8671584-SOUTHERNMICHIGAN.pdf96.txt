Major Quintavilla,
Took a call from the WFBH Radio in Indianapolis,Indiana 0315.
Wanted to know if we were going to send an investigative team to Indiana today. There was UFO that crashed into a gravel pit last night, 24 Mar 66, at 2030 hours near Indianapolis and the sheriff is on the scene at present. I informed them that we had not received a report from Indianapolis and could do nothing until the observer reported it observation to the Air Force. The radio station replied that he figured it wouldn't be reported since the sheriff was on the scene. Thanked us.
