1. We would like to thank Col Lt M W Secret for his excellent military career and outstanding flying object sightings. It is one of the most comprehensive sightings which we have encountered and which assures us that the accuracy of our visual analysis will enable this office to answer inquiries on this sighting with confidence.

2. We are re-evaluating the sighting to that of a small aircraft 'ch landing flight, as Lt Secret suggests.
