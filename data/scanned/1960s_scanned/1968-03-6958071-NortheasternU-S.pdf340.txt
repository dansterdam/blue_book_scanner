Data you can-review this questionnaire: 17 MARCH 1968
1. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

As I have stated earlier, I have never seen a jet trail on it after the sighting. There was no sound. The object stooped the year end, a distance of several miles, and there was no sound. There were several details for sound of the "jet" plane. There were no sound. I must emphasize that very strongly.
