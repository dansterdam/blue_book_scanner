16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered 'in front of':
Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound; b. Color; c. Size to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with the head of the match.

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing the object that you saw such as wings, fuselage, etc., and especially show the direction the object was moving. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
