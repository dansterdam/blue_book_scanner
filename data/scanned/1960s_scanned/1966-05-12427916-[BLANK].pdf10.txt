Special Studies 22 UFOs

In addition to "in-house studies," the Air Force contracted with an industrial consultant in 1951 for an independent analysis leading to: Special Report No. 14 (Analysis of Reports of Unidentified Aerial Objects), dated May 5, 1955. The methodology used in the preparation of this report is discussed below.

Consequently with this independent study, the Air Force appointed a Scientific Advisory Panel chaired by Dr. H. P. Robertson (California Institute of Technology). This five-man panel met during the week of January 14, 1953, and examined 75 of the best documented UFO cases. The panel concluded that the phenomena presented no threat to the security of the United States. It further recommended that the Air Force deprive the project of its special status, which would aid in decreasing the mystery attached to the subject. News releases and all matters dealing with the public would be handled by the Office of Information at the Secretary level.

Air Force Regulation 200-2

In 1953, Air Force Regulation 200-2 (see Appendix A) was issued, which established the responsibility and procedures for reporting information and evidence on UFO's, and for releasing information to the general public.

This regulation established the UFO Program to investigate and analyze UFO's over the United States. Such investigations and analyses are directly related to Air Force responsibility for the defense of the United States.

A questionnaire (see Appendix B) was prepared for use in documenting sightings of unidentified aerial phenomenon, entitled "U. S. Air Force Observation Questionnaire."
