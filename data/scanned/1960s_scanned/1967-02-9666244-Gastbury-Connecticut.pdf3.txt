Dear

On February 19, 1967 while shooting with my cousin, I spotted a unidentified flying object. It was round and white, and was hovering around 1800 and 1900 ft. We went to the nearest police and reported the incident.

I would appreciate it if you could investigate and publish the information.
Thank you
Sincerely
