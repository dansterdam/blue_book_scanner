"Another sighting, from the Buenos Aires newspaper "El Mundo," dated November 22, 1963, stated that Argentine residents of this city rushed to their windows at 12:30 A.M. to observe a strange object in the sky. The object was first seen at 12:10 A.M. and was visible for about 45 minutes. It was described as an elongated luminous mass, larger than an airplane and giving off a reddish glow, traveling at a high speed in a zig-zag course above the horizon. Among the numerous witnesses was a policeman who stated that the object was totally silent and did not appear to be an airplane or meteorological phenomenon. The witnesses stated that the object was clearly visible and that they could make out its shape and size."
