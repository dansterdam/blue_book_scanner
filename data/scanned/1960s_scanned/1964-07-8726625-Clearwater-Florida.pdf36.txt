The image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it appears to be a handwritten document or notes. The text in the image is blurred and illegible, and I cannot produce an accurate transcription. Without a clear photograph to describe, I will simply provide the text information provided in the context, which indicates this is page 36 of a document from the 1964-07-8726625-Clearwater-Florida.pdf file.
