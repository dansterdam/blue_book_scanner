In the early evening of 8 December 1960 a large oval shaped object was observed about 2 miles SW of Seminole, Texas. The object was in sight for about 20 minutes. At times it appeared to be hovering and at other times it seemed to be moving slowly. The object made no sound and was estimated to be 30-40 feet in diameter. At times a reddish-orange glow was seen around the edge of the object.

Several people in the area observed the object and it was reported to the Sheriff's office. Some of the witnesses were quite frightened as they had never seen anything like this before. Their descriptions of the object were consistent with one another.

The object was observed to leave the area at a high rate of speed, going straight up and disappearing from sight. No aircraft or other conventional objects were seen in the area at the time.
