The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document. The text on the page provides details about an observed object, including its size, trajectory, and parabolic orbit. The text also discusses the difficulties in determining the object's velocity and distance due to the information available.

Parabolic orbit: 1=11°, 2=17°, 3=17°, 4=17°
For comparison, white Sundisk's orbit was different- just two observers from his paper,
their differences due to what velocity they adopted:

d1=12.5°, b1=11°, c1=11°, d2=11.5°, b2=11°, c2=11°

It is rather surprising that our parabolic orbit, while in agreement with the above in velocity, is not in agreement with the various distance-the true being about 1 mile being indicated, while the various observers have it farther away-much farther away.

Without this one condition being satisfied it seems impossible for us to make an accurate determination of the size of this object.

This condition has been brought up before and been the cause of much discussion among the numerous observers who have reported and yet do not agree on the characteristics which they have observed.
