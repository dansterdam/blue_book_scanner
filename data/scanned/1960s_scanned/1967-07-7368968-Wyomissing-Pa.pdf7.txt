Transcription of the text in the document:

Gentlemen:
I wanted to inform you about the report I made on July 9th, 1967. This report was made to see if the cause of the disturbing night was investigated further. The incident occurred last night and I was quite frightened and bewildered by the event. This occurred at about 10:30 pm, my time. I had just returned home from my factory job and was preparing for bed. As I looked out the window, I saw a large bright light appear outside. My first impression was that it was a plane or helicopter, but as I watched closer, I saw that it was neither. It was hovering about 150 to 200 feet above the ground and was quite bright. The light was so bright it almost seemed to illuminate the area around it. All of a sudden, the light began to move. It moved very fast and close and I was terrified. I literally could not move or speak. The light then shot upwards at an extremely fast rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The whole incident lasted about 30 seconds. I wanted to report this to you again in the hope that my account may provide some additional information that could be useful in your investigations. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Sincerely,
[Signature]
