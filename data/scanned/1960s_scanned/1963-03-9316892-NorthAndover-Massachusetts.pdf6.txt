North Andover, Massachusetts
March 31, 1963

SUBJECT: Sighting of unidentified aerial objects

At approximately 3:45 today, Sunday, I spotted three bright objects circulating in an east-northeasterly direction over North Andover. The objects were circulating each other and passing each other. I saw them only for about a minute then suddenly they vanished. I'd say they were at an approximate height of three miles and traveling at an approximate 1,000 miles an hour.

Case 23: The committee generally disagrees with classifying this as unidentified because if the facts are as presented, the phenomena observed can be attributed to a natural or conventional explanation, if the details are provided by the observer. A lack of sufficient information or insufficient follow-up is the reason for the disagreement.
