UFO Photo Baffles
Astronomer At B.U.

BOSTON-The mysterious, well-lighted object which appeared to three persons in Weymouth, Mass., on the evening of June 26 has been photographed by an astronomer at Boston University.
The astronomer, who declined to be identified, said the object looked like a "flying saucer" and that its underside "had a very complicated pattern."
The object was sighted by Mrs. Doris Bingham, a Braintree housewife, and two companions who have not been identified. They reported seeing the object hovering over a Weymouth backyard for about an hour.
The astronomer said his study of the photograph "supports" the accounts of the three witnesses. He said the film showed an object with "a very bright light underneath" and that the "complicated pattern" was visible on the underside.
The State Board Head World Pay Raise She Didn't Want. The Commission on Administration and Finance said yesterday it would provide the necessary funds for a proposed 15% pay raise for state employees, despite the objections of Gov. Endicott Peabody.
