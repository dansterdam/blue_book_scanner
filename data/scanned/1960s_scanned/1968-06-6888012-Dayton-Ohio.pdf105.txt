The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely part of the Project Blue Book UFO reports.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text contained in the document:

At question #3 of the questionnaire you state: "change brightness" or "flicker or flicker" 

The sample was the shape similar to approximately 30 feet long and 10 feet wide, as to the changing of its brightness, if real, seemed to show by its irregular pulsating nature the flashing or fluctuating on and off, to disappear from around object in upward direction as opposed to any other direction. Light than very strong from object contrasted with only the bright phenomena observed. At night right of its disappearance it reappeared about 70 feet away and hovered motionless for about 10 minutes, then started to re-appear slowly.
