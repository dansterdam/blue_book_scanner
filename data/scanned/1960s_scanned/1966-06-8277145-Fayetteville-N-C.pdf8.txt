The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and some text. The diagram appears to be a sketch illustrating a UFO sighting, including instructions on how to draw the motion and direction of the object. The text discusses instructions for the observer, including placing marks on a compass to show the object's position, and drawing a picture to illustrate the motion of the object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
1st - observation was one light above the other moving parallel to ground
2nd - 5th single lights moving straight REFERRING TO THE END
