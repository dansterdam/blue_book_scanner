14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes. it moved out of sight rapidly - I could not keep track of it.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
Yes. If you answered YES, then tell what.
It moved behind some haze or fog, then reappeared.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes. If you answered YES, then tell what.
It moved in front of some haze or fog.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Noise - like an engine, but much slower 
b. Color: Light - Bright white or silver
c. Size: About the size of a dime held at arm's length

18. We wish to have the apparent size and the angular speed of the object. Hold a match stick or a pencil at arm's length in line with the object. Note the apparent size of the object in relation to the length of the match or pencil, and the speed of the object across your field of vision in relation to the match or pencil. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the match or pencil would the object have covered, and how fast would it have moved in relation to the match or pencil?
The object was about 1/3 the length of a match stick held at arm's length, and it moved across the field of vision about as fast as the match stick moved when waved back and forth slowly.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you may have noticed, such as exhaust, wings, tail, etc. Please do not make this sketch from memory, but from what you actually saw.
(There is a sketch of an oblong oval-shaped object with a tapered end and some interior lines or markings.)
