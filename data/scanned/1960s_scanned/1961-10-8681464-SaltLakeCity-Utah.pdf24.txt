I can't give you any description or shape of the object other than the sun was reflecting off the object. It appeared to be a metallic object. But I cannot give you any shape or size to any instance such as a pea or a baseball?

Could you determine the color?
The only color I could determine was silver.
Was this a solid silver color or did it appear to be vibrating or flashing?
It appeared to be flickering to a certain extent. I guess it was due to the reflection off the sun.
