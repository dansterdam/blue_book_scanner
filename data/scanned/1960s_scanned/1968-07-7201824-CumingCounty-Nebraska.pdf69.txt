MEMO
PHILIP J. KLASS
Jan. 29, 1969
Dear Hector:
As I long to know your interim report on the Omaha Fireball and the MIcors 1967.
This could prove to be a very important case.
P.s. You probably will not hear much from me for the next two weeks, since I will be crisscrossing Europe on a trip. When I return, (3) on being held by the CIA or DOD, on my last visit in Boston, Truth is that I am going skiing in Vermont and for 3 weeks, and shortly after I return to U.z. I will take a week to visit avionics companies in West Germany-this will be wrapped up writing my stories.
So please help to squeltch any of the above rumors.
