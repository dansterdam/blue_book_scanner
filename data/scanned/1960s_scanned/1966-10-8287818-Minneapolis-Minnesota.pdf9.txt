Freeman Jr., the Chief of the Civil Branch Community Relations Division of the Office of Information, responding to the recipient regarding an "unidentified flying object photo" that was provided.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr. _____:

We have been informed by Mr. _____ that you have reconsidered and are now willing to let the Air Force evaluate your recent unidentified flying object photo.

If you will forward the original negative, we will analyze it. If you have been using the type of film in your Polaroid camera which produced both a photo and a negative, a print and negative will be acceptable. The photo and/or negative will be returned to you.

In order to analyze the photos adequately we will need the following camera information:
(a) Type and make of camera.
(b) Type, focal length, and make of lens.
(c) Brand and type of film.
(d) Shutter speed used.
(e) Lens opening used, that is "f" stop.
(f) Filters used.
(g) Was tripod or solid stand used.
(h) Lighting used.
(i) Exact direction camera was pointing with relation to true North, and its angle with respect to the ground.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Sincerely,
GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
