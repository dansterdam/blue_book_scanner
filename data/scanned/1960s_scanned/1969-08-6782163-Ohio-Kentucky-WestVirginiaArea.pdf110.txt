This image appears to contain two sketches or drawings, but no photographs. The larger sketch in the center appears to be a compass or directional diagram, with annotations indicating "Direction of Travel". The two smaller sketches at the bottom appear to show a person or figure on a road or path in a landscape setting.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

DIRECTION OF TRAVEL

In the sketch below, a place as it may have appeared at the position of the phenomenon when last seen, and a small sketch to show the movement of the phenomenon between 'A' and 'B', that is, schematically show whether the movement was straight, curved, erratic, etc. (scheme to small to determine).
