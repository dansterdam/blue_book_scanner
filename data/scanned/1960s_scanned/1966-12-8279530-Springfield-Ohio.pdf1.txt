11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observed an object that appeared as a light. One witness said the object was a bright light that seemed to hover over a plane north and south. The object then moved rapidly to the east and appeared to land. The object then came back to the east again and appeared behind a tree, but then came back in another area of the sky.
The description is consistent with that reported for an aircraft observation.
