The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

The sighting of August 13th, 12:17 A.M. Eastern Daylight Time was observed by a Mrs. U.S. in the East Greenburg, and it will follow mentionary two other two sightings differ from that.

Mr. --- had been out most of the night watching for the appearance of the object be sighted the might before. On the first time it was a retrograde satellite he kept a vigil all that evening on house and had gone in for just a few minutes before 12:17 A.M. and missed sighting another similar one which passed.

When he got outside, under object directly overhead, apparently hovering some from the east, exactly in the zenith and proceeded at a rate of about 2Â° per second was about 20 or 30 feet across the western horizon, where it faded out. The entire journey in 25 plus or minus 5 seconds (when we're retired memory over the telephone, it came cut 35 seconds). He stated the seemed to move definitely faster than a-jet, but by no means as fast as a meteor. He rules out a planes on several points. He also states the cause as they are in the New York-Pittsburgh flight pattern and extremely familiar with planes from that standpoint, and from travel in the Naval Air Force on a regular commuter for four years.

It is interesting to note that if the objects on successive occasions been a retrograde satellite, the period would have been 4 hour and sure giving an extremely short period which is singular and so much that observes.
There is the outside possibility that he observed natural satellite which would have had a life of just a few days inasmuch that night until dawn, but the object did not reappear. So the passage would have been considerably to the west, the object might have lost in the earth's shadow at about 3:00 A.M.
