The image contains two elongated shapes that appear to be drawn or sketched, with multiple arrows pointing towards them. The text below the image describes the observation, stating that when first observed from a distance, the light appeared to move to the right and stop, then to the left and stop, before continuing to move. The text also notes that no shape or body could be seen at that distance, only the lights.
