Transcribed text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object would appear to be above the horizon. Next, place a "B" on the same curved line to show how low the object would appear to be above the horizon. The line between the "A" and "B" represents the total angle through which the object would pass when you had seen the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Give a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
