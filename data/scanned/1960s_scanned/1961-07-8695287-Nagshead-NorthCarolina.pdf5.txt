The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a form with instructions and various fields to be filled out. The form appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. If POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the total size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand:
(Circle One):
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Quarter
f. Silver dollar
g. Grapefruit
h. Basketball
i. Other _______________

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22):
a. Very sure
b. Fairly certain
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? _____________________________________________________________

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could have the object that you saw. If what you imagined would be different from what you actually saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
