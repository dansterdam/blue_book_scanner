Dear Sir,

I would appreciate it very much if you could give me any additional information on Project Bluebook. Also, I have a copy of a picture that the U.S. Air Force allegedly made in 1952. If you could give me any information on this, I would certainly appreciate it very much.

Thank you for your time and trouble.

Sincerely,

[Redacted]
