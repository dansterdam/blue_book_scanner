There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, with handwritten notes and responses to various questions about a reported UFO sighting.

Here is the text from the document, as transcribed by an OCR system:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? WELL IT WENT OFF A GREEN COLOR THAT WAS LIKE A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT AND DISAPPEARED VERY FAST.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't know. If you answer yes, it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't know. If you answer yes, it moved in front of: THERE WAS A HIGH LEVEL SMOKE SCREEN OR CLOUDS AND IT SEEMED TO GO BEHIND IT.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound SOUND WAS A HUM
b. Color BRIGHT WHITE - SQUARE - CHANGED TO GREEN

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? I WOULD GUESS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE MATCH HEAD

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label the picture to show such things as the relative size of the object, direction, etc., and especially the direction the object was moving. 
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

OBJECT FORMED A SQUARE, IT WAS CLEAR AND BRILLIANT, FLEW ALMOST SILENTLY, CHANGED COLOR TO GREEN, AND SEEMED TO BE SMALL IN ACTUALLY MOVING THROUGH CLOUDS ABOUT 4000 FEET HIGH.
