The image contains a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a UFO report form. There is a sketch of a UFO drawn on the bottom portion of the document, showing a circular object with red light rays going upward and blue circular lights.

The text from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Cant say, -100'150' altitude, stopped in sight for a moment and then disappear at super speed,

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Every small, at around 15 ft altitude
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. If you have drawn a picture to show the shape of the object, the details on the drawing should agree with your description in the previous question.
