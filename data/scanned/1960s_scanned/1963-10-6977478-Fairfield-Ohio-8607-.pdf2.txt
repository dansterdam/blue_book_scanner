He stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape and was hovering in the sky at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet. Mr. WINGER reported that the object was silent and remained in the same position for several minutes. He further stated that the object then suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight.
