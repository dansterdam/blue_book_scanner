Sighting Report
August 15, 1966
Mr. and Mrs. Bishop
Minneapolis International Airport control tower

In the log-book of the control tower there is an entry at 0330 UP (2230, August 15), noting that a Mr. Brew, a controller, observed a UFO to the NE of the tower. Mr. Brew thought that the object was a reflection of the moon, and paid no attention to it, according to his watch supervisor Mr. Bishop; shortly thereafter a phone call from White Bear Lake (15 or 20 miles from St. Paul) from an unknown person called attention to a similar observation in the same direction, but by that time there was nothing visible. 

Mr. Bishop's number is 612-681-7539.
