Transcription of the text in the document:

My original report of my sighting of the object which I called a UFO occurred on June 27, 1960 at about 11:15 PM. I was standing in the doorway of my home at (redacted) in Danvers, Massachusetts, when I noticed a bright light moving in the sky from the northeast. It moved in a zig-zag manner and stopped abruptly before moving away at a high rate of speed. I told my wife and three children what I had seen. This object did not resemble any conventional aircraft that I am familiar with. I have had a lifelong interest in aviation and am quite familiar with various types of aircraft. I am a reserve officer in the U.S. Air Force and have been for many years. I am a solid citizen in the community and have no reason to fabricate or exaggerate my story. I had one of your investigators, a Mr. (redacted), come to my home shortly after the incident and I described to him in detail what I had observed. I hope this additional information is helpful to your investigation. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
