FOR SUSPECTED ASTRONOMICAL SIGHTINGS WE USE THE SERVICES OF DR. J. ALLEN
HYNEK, ASTRO-PHYSICIST AND PROJECT BLUE BOOK CONSULTANT, ALSO DR. CHARLES P.
OLIVIER, HEAD OF THE AMERICAN METEOR SOCIETY, AND DR. ROBINSON, AN ASTRONOMER
FROM WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB. WE ALSO, FREQUENTLY REFER TO OPEN LITERATURE
SUCH AS SKY & TELESCOPE FOR CURRENT INFORMATION ON COMETS, METEORS, AND
AURORAL DISPLAYS.
ALTHOUGH MY OFFICE STAFF IS SMALL, WITHIN THE WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB
COMPLEX, I HAVE THE SERVICES OF PHYSICISTS, CHEMISTS, ASTRONOMERS, METEOR-
OLOGISTS, AERODYNAMIC ENGINEERS, AND PHOTO ANALYSTS. THESE PEOPLE ARE
AVAILABLE TO THE PROJECT WHENEVER THEY ARE NEEDED.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD, THAT I HAVE RECEIVED EXCELLENT ORGANIZATIONAL
AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FROM ALL ECHELONS IN THE AIR STAFF. THE SECRETARY
OF THE AIR FORCE AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF ARE INTERESTED IN THIS PROGRAM.
I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE AIR FORCE MUST EVALUATE SUBJECTIVE
INFORMATION WHICH CANNOT BE DUPLICATED IN A LABORATORY. WE ARE EVALUATING
AN OBSERVER'S INTERPRETATION OF AN EXPERIENCE OR EVENT. WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF METEORITES, WE HAVE NEVER RECOVERED ANYTHING TANGIBLE OF EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL
ORIGIN.
