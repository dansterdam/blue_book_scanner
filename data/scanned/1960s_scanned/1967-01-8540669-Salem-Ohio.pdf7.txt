The image does not contain a photograph, only handwritten text. I will proceed to output the text found in the document:

They seemed to be quite slim and they were about 3 feet long. They would just hover and didnt seem to move very much. At first sight, I thought they were some kind of small boys, till I got a closer look and saw what they really were. I passed night where they did, and went into a state of fear that I had never experienced before. They were quite bright and had a slight blue glow to them. They were hovering approximately 30-40 feet off the ground. There was a little silence and apparent fear. We were slightly awed. 
There were no second scene to come - just one brief silence. Aside from not being able to move it reminds me of a Barkley house call. I felt sorry I could not have seen this thing better. This could have been a visiting race from some other planet. Strange - the only recorded incident.
