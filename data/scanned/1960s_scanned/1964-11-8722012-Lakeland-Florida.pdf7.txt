Dear Sir,
My friends and I were out watching the storm when we noticed an orange light.
The light was hovering about 500-700 mph. Decor did not change (no color change) and had no sound. We could not figure out what we were seeing. After watching it for land 5 minutes it just disappeared in front of our eyes. Three of us saw it. I was should tell you about the incident. 
Sincerely,
