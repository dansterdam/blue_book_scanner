EQ USAP SAPON-CC (Mrs Hunt)
Reference the attached letter from information on this unidentified observation. The following is presented:

Your very vivid description and realistic drawing presented, indicates an operation similar to an upper air research balloon as it bursts. Balloons of this nature are launched by the U.S. Air Force generally programmed to fly between 30,000 feet and 125,000 feet. They can be destroyed by ground stations determined to the balloon's position.
In the past, observations of this nature have assisted in recovery of the instrument packages associated with these projects.
We wish to thank you for presenting this observation to the Air Force.
