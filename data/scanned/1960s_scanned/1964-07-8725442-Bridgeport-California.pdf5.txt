Dear Mrs. XXXXXXXXXX,

This is in reply to your letter of July 22, 1964, requesting information on a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) made on July 12, 1964 in the Bridgeport, California area.

A BOAC flight was making a scheduled approach to the Bridgeport airport at 5:30 a.m. on July 12, 1964, when the crew observed a strange light in the sky. The light was observed for about 15 minutes and then disappeared. The aircraft crew stated that you observed one of the phenomena.

I regret that we cannot be more specific on this particular sighting. I suggest that you continue your interest in this field and report any further sightings to the Office of Information Division.

Sincerely,

MAJOR M. JACOBS
CHIEF, INFORMATION DIVISION
OFFICE OF INFORMATION

Mrs. XXXXXXXXXX
Alameda, California
