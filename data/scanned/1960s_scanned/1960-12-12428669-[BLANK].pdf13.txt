COLONEL TACKER: Well I'd say they've been definitely on the decrease.

COLONEL TACKER: Approximately two per cent for the last four or five years. Let me go out -- this is a claim, really, of some of the UFO groups in claiming that the Air Force withholds information on this subject. They say that we give an erroneous figure when we give two per cent and I have been very careful to stress that that is in the last five years. Initially in the program, I'd say what UFO uncovers on the high as twenty per cent back in the 1940's.

And certainly this unit at Bedford would be able to
