Berea, Ohio 
Reported 8 July 1964 
11:40 PM EST

Report from Mr. X, age 28, male, Caucasian, high school graduate, married, employed as a printer. He was in the backyard of his home when he observed a large, lighted object in the sky moving slowly from east to west at an altitude he estimated to be about 500 feet. The object appeared to be circular in shape, had a bright, luminous glow, and made no sound. It remained in sight for approximately 2-3 minutes before passing out of sight to the west. Reporting person appeared calm and sincere in his account; no indication of hoax or hallucination.
