28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

OBJECT STARTED MOVING SLOWLY, THEN ACCELERATED TO APPARENT SPEED AND WENT OUT OF SIGHT IN DISTANCE.

Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
