3. IS THERE ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT THAT YOU FAILED TO MENTION OR WHAT YOU SAY DESCRIBES WHAT YOU SAID OCCURRED IN YOUR OWN WORDS: 
MY NIGHT MANAGER CALLED ME TO OBSERVE WHAT HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE A MISSILE FIRING OR SOME TYPE OF AERIAL ACTIVITY. WHEN I WENT OUTSIDE I OBSERVED A QUITE BRIGHT OVAL SHAPED OBJECT HOVERING MOTIONLESS IN THE SKY. IT SEEMED TO BE HOVERING DIRECTLY OVER THE TOWN AND WAS QUITE IMPRESSIVE TO WATCH. AFTER OBSERVING IT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES IT SUDDENLY SHOT OFF AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. I HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT ANY TYPE OF AIRCRAFT WITH WHICH I AM FAMILIAR. WHATEVER IT WAS, IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE ANYTHING NORMAL OR CONVENTIONAL.
4. DID YOU NOTICE ANY GOOD, NOISE, OR HEAT EMANATING FROM THE PHENOMENON OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF?
