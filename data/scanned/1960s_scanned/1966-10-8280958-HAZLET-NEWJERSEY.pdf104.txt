Dear Sir:

I am writing to you as a result of an incident that occurred to me. About eight weeks ago, I was outdoors running and partly dark when I noticed to go in to 6:30 or 7:00 in the evening, and since it was partly dark I could not see very well. Just as we were almost home, I happened to see a blue light that I could see any shape my telescope. The sky was clear, and the moon bright. Everything was perfect still. As I watched what I thought was a bright star, it moved in a circular motion as if to clear the sky of something that was not a star. It was something know was not a star or anything like that. Something to the effect of being similar and then from the motion of lessening gradually the light became more and more scattered and gradually the light became more scattered and gradually became smaller and smaller and finally disappeared completely. It was something I know was not a star or anything like that. Something to the effect of being similar and then from the motion of lessening gradually the light became more and more scattered and gradually the light became more scattered and gradually became smaller and smaller and finally disappeared completely.
