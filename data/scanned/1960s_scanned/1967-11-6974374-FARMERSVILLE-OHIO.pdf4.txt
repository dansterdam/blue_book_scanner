SUBJECT: Request for Comments on UFO Observations
TO: Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Dill Reference the attached report from Farmerville, Ohio on an unidentified observation of 5 November 1967.
The reported sightings on 29-30 October 1967 which were considered as possible indication did not result in definite identification. The observations on 5 November 1967, as given, deserve more analysis.
We would appreciate your written comments as to the possibility of this sighting being induced from other sources or man-made objects on this date.
Farmerville, Ohio 20:21 EST. Since the sighting is so given as 20:00, duration taken and the moon had a southern declination angle which, of course, indicated that the moon was the culprit. The moon, of course, was not full but that its illumination was not so complete as to account for a "bright object" of such duration. The explanation, that the moon was the object involved, does not appear adequate. The object observed did not seem to have the characteristics of the moon, but I do not think this was a serious sighting. Also, he said he thought it might be some "moon which the "moon wouldn't be visible" wait it was.
