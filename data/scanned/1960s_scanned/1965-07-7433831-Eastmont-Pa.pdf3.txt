KWL COMMENTS: VISUAL SIGHTING REPORTED IN PART ONE WAS PROBABLY THE BALLOON SIGHTED VISUALLY BY INTERCEPTORS OVER OHIO.THE SIZE, DESCRIPTION AND FLIGHT PATH APPEAR TO CORRESPOND (2) THE RADAR TARGET IN PART TWO COULD BE THE LIGHT PLANE SIGHTED BY THE INTERCEPTORS, ALTHOUGH TIS IS ONLY A POSSIBILITY, IT DOES LIKELY APPEAR TO HAVE SAME FLIGHT PATH AND OTHER FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS
(3) THE OBJECTS IN PART ONE AND TWO WERE NOT THE SAME AND I BELIEVE THE ABOVE CONCLUSIONS AS TO THEIR IDENTITY ARE VALID.
