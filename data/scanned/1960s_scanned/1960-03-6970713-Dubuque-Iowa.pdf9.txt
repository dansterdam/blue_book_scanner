The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

(B) The very nature of the observations rules out celestial of subterranean origin (stars, meteors, etc.).
(C) The nature of the sighting also rules out "light phenomena" such as balloons, birds, etc.
(D) The direction of the objects' flight compared with wind directions as the time excludes balloons from being considered as the correct identification.
(E) The rather widely separated points of observation rules out "psychologic aberrations".
(F) The character of the witnesses discounts the possibility of a hoax.

IV. Arguments for Unidentifiable Objects (UFOs):

Charles Morris is a commercial pilot and has logged 5,000 hours in 14 years of commercial flying. He is familiar with aircraft of most types. He apparently saw the objects at rather close range. He told Ralph Ingersol, writer for the Dubuque Telegraph-Herald, that he saw them distinctly as they passed over his ship. They looked like "very large glittering objects." He was seeing them from the side, and they looked "very large certainly larger than anything I've ever seen in the sky."

"They couldn't have been jets; they weren't fast enough, for one thing - a jet would have been gone before I could get a good look at them. True, as jet probably would have disappeared that fast, but these objects were only moving at a moderate rate of speed - perhaps 200-250 above the haze." (From Dubuque Telegraph-Herald, March 6, 1950, p.8)

This sighting lends support in the fact that, the check with Traux AFB, Madison, Wisconsin, by the Telegraph-Herald indicates, the objects had not been reported in the area, because as far as we can tell from that page, those objects had not been reported in the area. This suggests that these sightings were genuine, unexplained Unidentified Flying Objects.
