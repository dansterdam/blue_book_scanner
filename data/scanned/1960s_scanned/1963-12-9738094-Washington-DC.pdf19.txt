2.  On the data presented, we have been unable to evaluate the sighting(s) since the object(s) and/or objects viewed were apparently over International Airport during a period of very busy air activity and no reports were made from air traffic control or other official sources. The phenomenon was observed, but believed to be a natural occurrence and/or may be unidentifiable. No conclusion as to the cause of the sighting and/or sightings.
