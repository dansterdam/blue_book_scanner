REPORT ON VISUAL SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
(Compiled August 3, 1965)

On Monday night August 2, 1965 between approximately 10:10 and 10:25 P.M. my wife, [redacted], and I visually observed an object in flight over the northern part of Austine. The following is a description of the object observed and the path flown:

The object was first observed in the northern sky at approximately 10:10 P.M. at an angle of approximately 15° from horizontal. It, to the naked eye, appeared as a bright star moving slowly from west to east. The object was then observed through 12 power binoculars. It was then ascertained that there were several individual white lights, the number of which is unknown but is felt to be four or five. The object appeared (on basis of the lights) as a large dirigible, its speed, however, was stated to be slow (estimated around 50 mph) and the lights varied from time to time in intensity. To the naked eye, the intensity ranged from the brightest star (or possibly brighter) to almost fade-out.

The object continued eastward across the northern sky (at what appeared to be a constant altitude) for about five minutes. It then appeared to be motionless for less than one minute. At this point, the object had traveled through an arc of approximately 70° from our vantage point. The object then appeared to have risen vertically for a few (less than 10) seconds. After approximately two minutes, we realized that it was moving almost directly toward us, e.g., in a westerly direction.
