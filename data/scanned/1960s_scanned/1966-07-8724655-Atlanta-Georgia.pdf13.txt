On July 25, 1966 at approximately 0840 GMT I observed two bright lights traveling slowly over Atlanta, Georgia, south toward the horizon. These were observed with the unaided eye. No sound was heard. This gave impression of being silently high. Observed for about two or three minutes.

At about 0925 GMT I viewed a bright light to Northeast at about 30 degrees above horizon with distinctly changing colors of red, green and white. With the unaided eye this seemed larger than a star and seemed to disappear distinctly faster than a star and the colors were distinctly rotating. It appeared to be stationary.

On July 26, 1966 at 0745 GMT I viewed the object at about the same position as previous observation. Through binoculars it was noted to have an alternating red, green and white lights with the hanging part reflecting these colors. Green seemed to be the predominant color.

On July 27, 1966 at a time unknown I noted the presence of the object East-Northeast with the only difference being that it appeared smaller. During this observation it was moving from about 30 degrees to about 80 degrees above the horizon, and toward the East.
