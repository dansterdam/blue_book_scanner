Dear sir:
The very intriguing fireball observed over the Philadelphia area on Dec. 7, 1963 from 5:06 p.m. to 6:09 p.m. EST was carefully monitored by our staff. Unfortunately, cloudy conditions prevented a visual tracking of the object, but considerable photographic data was obtained.
Many observers, including members of your office, have reported seeing the fireball from various locations. We would be most interested in receiving any information you may have regarding this event, and in particular the exact time of observation and direction from which the object was seen.
It is possible our data can be correlated, thereby enabling us to determine the trajectory and possibly the origin of the fireball. Please let me know if you can assist me in this regard.
Yours truly,
