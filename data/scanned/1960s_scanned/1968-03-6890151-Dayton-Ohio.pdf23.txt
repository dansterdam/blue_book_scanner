Transcription of the text in the document:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'A' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 'B' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'A' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A 'B' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE 'A' AND 'B' WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. ALSO SKETCH ANY UNUSUAL FEATURES OF THE PHENOMENON, SUCH AS LIGHTS, SHAPE, ETC. THEN COMPARE THE TWO SKETCHES.
