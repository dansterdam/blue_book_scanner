14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
It disappeared, but I can't give any more detail on that.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object this experiment will cover. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
about 1 inch

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[A simple sketch is provided showing a circular or ovoid shaped object with a trailing 'tail' or 'vapor trail'.]
