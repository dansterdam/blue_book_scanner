Official Report By
Norwalk, Ohio

On December 1, 1965, I saw a bright white light which would turn a blue-green color and would seem to go up and down faster than it turned a fiery red and disappeared. On several nights while watching TV, I would look out the front window and see a bright light like a searchlight being turned off and on, while I would watch for a week at approximately 10:30 to 11:30 p.m.
