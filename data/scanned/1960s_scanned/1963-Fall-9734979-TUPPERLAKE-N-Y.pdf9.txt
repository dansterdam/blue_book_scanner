Transcription of the text in the image:

The object I am reporting was of a brilliant white color, oval in shape. It appeared from the north and was traveling in a southerly direction. It passed directly over my car, which was stopped at the time, at an estimated altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet. It was visible for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared into the distance. There was no sound or trail of any kind. The night was clear and the moon was nearly full.
