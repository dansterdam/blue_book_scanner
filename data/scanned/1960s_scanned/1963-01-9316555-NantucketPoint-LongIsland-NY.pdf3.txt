Dear Sir:

Your letter and I own and operate a small radio telescope in Nantucket Point out there in Montauk, Long Island, N.Y.

Do you have and can I send you the results of our activity, necessarily not to transmit and use what information I may learn if any about our position and what goes on. I'm not in a good position to send you and learn from you as well and as far as I can see no need to know about experiments in that level.

Nancy
