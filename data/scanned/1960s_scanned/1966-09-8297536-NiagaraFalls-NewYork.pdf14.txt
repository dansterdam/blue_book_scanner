Subject: Sightings of UFO's

During the last week of August, 1966, 3 - 4 persons working iir the tower at the Niagara Falla Airport, Niagara Falls, New York, have been concerned witnessing events in the sky which they believe might have some significance from a military standpoint.

Beginning on Sept 1st, 1966 UFO sighted, apparently circling around an area at high altitude, and then descending lo a lower altitude. This UFO silhoueltea was observed over the greater part ot the day by several observers, and was described as being metallic in appearance, glistening in the sunlight. Although I did not observe this UFO myself, I did talk to some of the observers, and they appeared to be quite sincere in their descriptions, and stated that the UFO had no visible means of propulsion, and appeared to maneuver without any audible sounds.

Sept 4th, 1966  UFO sighted, apparently approaching the Airport complex along the Niagara River, at a moderate altitude. This UFO showed definite features, i.e. reddish glow, conical shape, and there was no sound associated with its passage. It passed over the Airport, and disappeared from view.

Sept 7th, 1966  Drone-like aircraft circled the Niagara Falls Airport area for approximately 20-30 minutes, at low altitude. This craft was described as being disc-shaped, with a reddish glow around the periphery, and no sound was noted. Witnesses to this sighting were Maintenance personnel, aj 330 Bombardment Training Squadron, located at the Niagara Falls Airport.

I feel that this event, with no known explanation, should be of interest to your office, and any additional information or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
