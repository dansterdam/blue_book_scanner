Dear Mr. Crowder:

First I should like to thank you for your kindness in spending time with us on the 14th. I know this time you must be very weary of the whole matter after having reported the story so many times.

Would you be kind enough to clarify a couple points for me?

1. After the intense flash of light and after the object had disappeared or disintegrated, was there a sound you heard that you described as a whoosh or was the spot where the object had been, completely silent?

2. If you saw flames, approximately how high would you say the flames were, i.e., in such relation to the object as it was, a foot? 

3. If you saw flames going out, or until you felt it was safe to before going out, or until you felt it was safe to before going out, or until you felt it was safe to leave, how long did it last?

Again, thanks for your assistance.

Cordially,
(signed)
Philip J. Klass
