"Mr. Roy Porter, Chairman
NICAP OFFICE SUBCOMMITTEE
Box 19
Newton, Mass.

Dear Mr. Porter:

Please accept my apologies for the delay on this report. I am now past my general exams and ready to go on any further assignments.

It was a night when I visited with Mrs. Campbell, the Chairman, that we discussed various projects for the coming year. Among them was the wish to show the regular input from the consultant on any significant sightings. You feel it is important to show this regular input, and I agreed that this would be a good idea.

However, I am at somewhat of a loss regarding what further changes could be done on a regular basis. If you have any ideas on this, or criticisms of what I have done, please let me know.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]"
