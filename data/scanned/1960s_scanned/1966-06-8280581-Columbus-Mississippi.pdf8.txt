They observed a bright, flashing light in the sky. The light appeared to be stationary and was blinking in a random sequence of red, green, and white flashes. After observing the light for approximately 5 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. The informant described the light as being many times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. Visual sighting only, no other sensors were used.
