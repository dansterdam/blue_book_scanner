Dear Sir:
During the early summer of 1962, when said flight sightings were being reported in the [redacted], I witnessed what appears to be a similar situation. When trying to get a closer look at the said object, it eluded or seemed to just disappear. This was also witnessed by several other individuals who were with me at the time. The object was of the small metallic type and appeared to be changing course and speed as it maneuvered in the sky. It then seemed to just vanish into thin air.
I would be most interested in any information you could provide regarding this incident or any other similar sightings in this area.
Thank you for your attention in this matter.
Yours truly,
