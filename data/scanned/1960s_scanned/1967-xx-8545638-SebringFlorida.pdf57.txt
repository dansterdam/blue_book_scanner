Country: Mass.
NAME: MARSHALL, LT. COL., USAF

NOV: 1964

Flying Saucer
The object, reported by several observers, was very large and outstanding. Its motion was that of two windows of gigantic proportions. No sound, no smoke, but the windows pave blue reddish in color.
The object, which emitted no smoke, hovered above the treetops and then suddenly rose straight up silently and with tremendous speed. It flew towards the east to west.
Whether to make a full report or remain silent was difficult decision to make. The object was witnessed by several persons but the general public seemed to be skeptical of such reports.

The officer of the day at Otis Air Force Base was notified but found nothing flying. It was decided that there was nothing flying so no report was made.
