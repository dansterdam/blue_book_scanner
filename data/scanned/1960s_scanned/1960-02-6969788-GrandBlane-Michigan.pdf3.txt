UNIDENTIFIED FLYING ODJECT  REPORT

BAPS-33 (RR3 Factory)

1. Appearance - Attached copy of letter to APO from Robert Selfridge 
Air Force Base, identifying picture as "unidentified flying object, 
stationed 20 April 1960".

2. This color slide shows a peculiar-shaped object on the picture. It has been analyzed as follows:
The object appears to be on the picture - taking the crater Plato as the outstanding feature. The object apparently is a satellite, dark in color, and the only one visible. There is nothing else unusual shown in the photographic field.

It is the opinion of photographic experts that the object is not a process plate defect but a satellite as it exhibits none of the usual characteristics of a process plate defect. When viewed with the naked eye, the object appears a distinct, identifiable point of light. Microscopic examination reveals damage to the emulsion in the area concerned.

3. The attached letter does not spell out the claims of the observer. While it identifies the object as a "flying saucer in the vicinity of the moon", there is no obvious support for this. The object was a space craft in the vicinity of the moon, but its identity as a flying saucer seems to be a presumptuous conclusion.

4. It is the observation that the blue spots on the slide are not but result from damage to the emulsion, probably during the developing process.

5. Suggests the slides be returned to the subject. Comments:
