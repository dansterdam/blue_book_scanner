The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

The text on the page discusses an evaluation of the testimony of four individuals who claimed to have witnessed an unidentified object in the sky. The document discusses the reasoning behind the evaluation, including the possibility that the object could have been the moon, and the challenges in verifying such phenomena.

The text output is as follows:

reasonably consistent with the evaluation that it was the moon.

I cannot follow Hynek's reasoning that, as far as he could see, it was not the moon.

Hynek says "Unless we discount the testimony of all four." I don't see the testimony of all four, as they, despite her declaration to the contrary, was probably very excited and hysterical. Under such conditions, autolcinesis is common.

I have observed it myself. Moreover the phenomenon can be transmitted to another person.

In brief, I have heard so much over the years, about "stars cavoring over the sky," and the impossibility of explaining them, and the lack of understanding and appreciation of auto-kinetic effects, that I think the time has come to review such cases. Or, in the case of new cases involving "jerky motions," to recognize the auto-kinetic syndrome.

I see no stretching of the evidence whatever to identify this object as the moon. And if, by the qualification "given" Hynek means to distinguish between the actual testimony and possible conclusions drawn from testimony, then he is not properly "weighing" the reliability of humans witnessing such a phenomenon. I see no reason to assume that the "icasite horizon" was obscured," simply because "not one of the four saw the rising quarter moon." That is a complete misstatement. Everyone, including Ardene, testified that the object "looked like the moon." It was Ardene who insisted that it could not be the moon because of its apparent motion. And Hynek concludes by the statement, which seems to me completely unwarranted by the evidence, that "it seems unlikely that the four, particularly the engineering student, would not have recognized the moon over a previous at least five minutes."

The transcript speaks for itself. The engineering student described what he thought he saw as the moon. The only reason he doubted it, was because of the silence. And much the same response came from others. Moreover, I see no reason why, from the evidence itself, at least three of them reported that they were really seeing something that looked like the moon.
