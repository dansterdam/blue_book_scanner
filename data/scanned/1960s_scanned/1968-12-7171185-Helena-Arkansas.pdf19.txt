The image contains a hand-drawn sketch that appears to depict the path of a UFO sighting. It shows a valley with mountains on either side, and an arrow-like trajectory of the observed phenomenon moving from right to left. There is also some accompanying text that provides instructions for the observer and asks them to estimate the angular size of the observed object.

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

AFR 80-17(C1)

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE ANGULAR SIZE, TRAIL, EXHAUST, AND INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING. 

These were no upper trails or tails. It rose directly up fron valley to south.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR TREE. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH -- NOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH.
