1. Enclosed is the attached letter from Mr William B. Hassell of El Paso, Texas, transmitting information on an unidentified flying object on 29 June 64, at El Paso, Texas.

2. The above sighting was investigated by the 25th Bombardment Wing, and the report indicated that the object in question was first observed at El Paso, Texas, and tracked on radar by an FAA station and the El Paso Air Force Base. The object proceeded in an easterly direction.

3. The film was forwarded to Dallas, Texas for processing. Although the film contained blurred images, it was determined that the object was not sufficiently defined to be considered an authentic UFO sighting.

4. The film was examined by the Photographic Interpretation Laboratory of the Air Force Systems Command, and in the opinion of Jack Spiro, the photographic interpretation specialist, the film did not contain any evidence of an authentic UFO. Therefore, it was decided that the film should be treated as an uncorrelated object and no further investigation was indicated.

5. The vita was a first description of a sighting, although it contained relatively innocuous details, and the photograph was inconclusive with no clear evidence of a structured device. Therefore, this case was considered as a balloon observation.
