"NORTHEAST OHIO 
LOCAL SIGHTINGS - GREATER AKRON AREA - 1964

29 September 1964

Badin Township, Ohio

On 29 September 1964 at about 8:00 PM, a man and his family were outside their home in Badin Township, Ohio, when they noticed a bright light in the sky. This light illuminated the whole area and appeared to be larger than a star. It was hovering about 500 to 600 feet in the air. This light was described as bluish-white in color and was visible for about 10 minutes. It then moved away to the east and disappeared. 

The witnesses stated that the light seemed to illuminate the spot where it was hovering. They also related that it made no sound at all.
