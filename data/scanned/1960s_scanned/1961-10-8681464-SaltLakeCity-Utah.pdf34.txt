SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH - 2 Oct 61: About 1:00 P.M., a private pilot, apparently a metallic, disc-shaped object as he was taking off from the Salt Lake Central airport. He first thought it was an aircraft but saw no wings or tail, so he began watching it closely.

The object appeared to hover at least fifty feet across and four only to have it move upward "like an elevator", then to the south at high speed. An astonished pilot and other witnesses said the object was about the size of a silver dollar but that it appeared quite large, proportionately, in the sky. After hovering a short while, the disc moved straight up again, then disappeared to the west.

The object was also seen from the ground by airport officials and other witnesses. The disc is said to have been in sight for two to three minutes. In appearance, except when it turned toward the sun, the disc shone brilliantly.
