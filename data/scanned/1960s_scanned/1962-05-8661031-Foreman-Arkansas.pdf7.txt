IS FORWARDED FOR YOUR INFORMATION. QUOTE, GENTLEMEN: THE
OTHER NIGHT MY FATHER AND I SAW A VERY STRANGE SIGHT IN THE SKY.
I WAS IN THE EAST WHERE WE SAW IT. AT FIRST WE THOUGHT IT
WAS A SATELLITE, BUT THEN WE DISCOVERED IT WASN'T BECAUSE IT
STARTED TO MOVE LIKE A SHOOTING STAR. WE WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT TWO
MINUTES AND THEN IT BLACKED OUT. WHEN IT BLACKED OUT WE
COULD SEE NOTHING BUT DARKNESS. COULD YOU POSSIBLY TELL ME
WHAT THIS COULD BE? YOURS TRULY, CLIFF. UNQUOTE. LETTER DATED 5
