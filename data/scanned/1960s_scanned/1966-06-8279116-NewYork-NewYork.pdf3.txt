Dear Sirs:

I submit the following credible incident secondary to an investigation conducted in the General Electric Central Park area of General Park around 52nd Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues.

I was sitting in a parked automobile on 52nd Street and suddenly I was dazzled by a small object (darkish in color) swiftly moving up and down in a series of zigzagging maneuvers. This object was so fast that it seemed at times to be in two or three places at once, as it literally flitted in an incredible manner up, down, and around. I was quite amazed and perplexed as to the nature of this object and its unnatural performance.

My senses are very keen, and I was able to determine that this object was small, about the size of a basketball, and egressed or appeared to come out of a slight haze or vapor trail. It then would suddenly disappear and reappear again in a different location. This activity went on for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, then it just vanished completely and was not seen again.

This incident happened about 3:00 PM on a clear day, and many people including myself had an opportunity to observe it. I trust this information will be of interest to your organization and I will be glad to furnish any additional details if required.

Yours very truly,
