CONTENTS: The observer called the duty officer to report a UFO sighting on April 16, 1968. This report # 117 was sent to the observer. Since the witness was last seen and the exact date was not given, the sighting was given only as April 16. The time of the sighting was also different by a month, as we also received a completed form 117 from the listing observer on 16 May 68. The details of the observation are that the course, time, and speed are conflicting, but the sighting is considered case conflicting.
