REPORT OF FIELD INVESTIGATION
Socorro, New Mexico - April 24, 1964

On the evening of April 24, 1964, Police Officer Lonnie Zamora was patrolling the outskirts of Socorro, New Mexico, when he saw a blue flame in the sky to the southwest. He gave chase and saw an oval-shaped object on the ground approximately 1/4 mile from his patrol car. The object was white in color with red lettering on the side. As he approached to within 150 yards, he heard a loud roar and saw the object rise slowly, then shoot up and away at a high rate of speed. The only damage found at the site was some burned brush and earth.

Zamora's description of the object was as follows: 
Oval in shape, about 20 feet long and about 6 to 8 feet high. 
White in color with red lettering on the side. 
A blue flame coming from the underside as it rose, and a loud roar.
Landed on two leg-like landing gears.
