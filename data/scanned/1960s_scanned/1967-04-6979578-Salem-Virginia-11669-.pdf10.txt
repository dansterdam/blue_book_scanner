REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
Case No. 11669

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: SALEM, VIRGINIA
DATE: MARCH 17, 1967  

On March 17, 1967, at approximately 6:15 PM, the Reporting Witness, Mr. John E. Doe, observed an unidentified flying object while driving east on Highway 460, approximately 5 miles west of Salem, Virginia.

The object was first observed hovering approximately 100 feet above the ground, about 1/2 mile distant from the Reporting Witness. It appeared to be round or oval in shape, and was emitting a bright, blue-white light. The object then accelerated rapidly, climbing at a steep angle and disappearing from view in approximately 3 seconds.

The Reporting Witness stated that the object did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion, and made no audible sound. He estimated the size of the object to be approximately 30 feet in diameter. 

No other witnesses were identified at the time of the incident. The Reporting Witness was interviewed at his residence on March 18, 1967. He appeared to be a credible individual with no history of mental illness or tendency toward fabrication. His account of the incident was consistent and plausible.

Based on the information provided, this case is classified as an UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. The rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object, as well as the lack of any visible means of propulsion, are characteristics that cannot easily be explained by conventional aircraft or other known phenomena.
