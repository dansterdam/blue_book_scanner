The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

TDYET/UFO
Request for UFO Information

USAF (SAFOTRC)
Reference the attached letters requesting information on unidentified flying objects. The replies indicate that no further reports have been prepared and are with the Director of Technology and Subsystems.

FOR THE COMMANDER
JAMES C. MANATT, Colonel, USAF
Director of Technology and Subsystems

The handwritten note at the bottom of the document says "Jo Sophie (May 67)".
