The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which is a collection of documents from the U.S. Air Force's historical investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document, produced by an optical character recognition (OCR) system:

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE AND WHAT WERE THE SPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UFO SIGHTING? THE WITNESS STATED THAT THE ANGULAR SIZE HELD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH. GIVEN THIS INFORMATION AND ASSUMING THAT THE WITNESS IS APPROXIMATELY 5'10" TALL, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE UFO WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 1 DEGREE OF ARC. THIS MEANS THAT THE UFO WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SAME APPARENT SIZE AS A QUARTER HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. THE WITNESS DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS BEING METALLIC AND ROUND IN SHAPE. NO OTHER SPECIFIC SPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS WERE REPORTED.
