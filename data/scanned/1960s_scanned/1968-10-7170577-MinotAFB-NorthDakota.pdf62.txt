The image contains a compass-like diagram at the top, as well as two sketches or illustrations in the bottom half. The compass diagram appears to depict the direction or orientation of an observed phenomenon. The two lower sketches show landscape scenes, potentially related to the observed phenomenon.

The text in the document is as follows:

"IF THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. MAKE A SKETCH OF THE AREA SHOWING LOCATION AT WHICH PHENOMENON APPEARED AND INCLUDE ANY LANDMARKS OR BACKGROUND DETAIL TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT APPROACHED YOU AS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
