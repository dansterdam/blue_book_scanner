"No Case (Information Only)
24 January 1963
East London, South Africa

The Daily Despatch, East London, published a report on January 24, 1963 from a Mrs. H.E. Jenkin, Sherwell, Berea, East London, South Africa regarding a sighting of a strange object that she and her husband saw on January 23, 1963 at approximately 9:00 p.m. While driving home, they saw a brilliant, stationary object in the sky. It was large and seemed to be emitting a ball of light or glow around it. It remained stationary for some time and then moved off at a high speed, disappearing from sight. The caller was impressed by the object and considered it to be a genuine Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)."
