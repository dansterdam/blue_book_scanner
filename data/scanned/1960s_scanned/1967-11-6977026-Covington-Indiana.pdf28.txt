Lt Mareno and Col Quintenilla all details of his sighting of 19 November however, do to the time lapse he said he couldn't remember that much. said often times these objects appear low on the horizon and looked larger but they keep moving and changing colors. They even done this he put binoculars on them. said he couldn't estimate as size since he had never been in an airplane, however, most of these objects below what he called the star level. Sometimes he would watch the objects for several hours and other times it would be for just minutes. said he was certain they were because they are always coming out of Chanute and Bunker Hill and make a lot of noise, however, the objects observed did not make any noise. Lt Mareno asked him to give a description of the sighting. In particular, stressing the time that each photo was taken, the order of the photos and the azimuth and elevation of the objects when each photo was taken. It seemed from his description that there were several sightings that night. However, it was difficult to determine if the photos were taken of one sighting or during several sightings. Lt Mareno gave him four AF Forms 117 and asked him to complete them so that we could better understand the sequence of events as they occurred that night. said that he would complete and return these forms.
