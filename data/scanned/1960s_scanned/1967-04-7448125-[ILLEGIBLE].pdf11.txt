There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 13 day May 1962
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. I sent you a complete report with detailed drawings some time ago but I suppose this was not received. I simply noted a strange object move across the sky and drop a smaller object which fell to the ground near me. Thank you for your gracious interest in my sighting.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
