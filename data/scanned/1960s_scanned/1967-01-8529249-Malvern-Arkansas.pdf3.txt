The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned page from a UFO report document. The page appears to be part of a questionnaire or report form, with various questions and spaces for the witness to provide responses.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It seemed to get smaller and going away.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one:) Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one:) Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - None

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and see how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time, tell us how much of the object was covered by the match head?
About the size of the match head

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.
[Sketch is provided showing a round or oval-shaped object with the note "very rounds swish it went out of sight very fast"]
