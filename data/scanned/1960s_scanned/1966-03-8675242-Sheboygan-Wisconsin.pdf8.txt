Gentlemen:
On the night of March 24, shortly after 11:15 p.m., my sister and I were outside on our farm when we noticed a very bright light in the sky which appeared to be hovering in the distance. The light was almost constant in color and much brighter than any star in the sky. The light seemed to move up and down and sideways for several minutes, which to us was most unusual.
The light then came to a stop and hovered very still. At one point it seemed to split into two objects, which then came back together. The two objects then seemed to stop moving and just hovered in one spot for about ten minutes. After that, the light suddenly shot straight up at a very fast speed and disappeared from our view. The whole incident lasted for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.
I would appreciate it if you would have someone from your office or the Air Force investigate this occurrence, as we are very much interested in determining what this object could have been. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me.
