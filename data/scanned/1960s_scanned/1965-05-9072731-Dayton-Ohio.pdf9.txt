Called and wanted to know when her sighting was that she had in May, said it was in the first two weeks. I said I would call her back. Called her back and told her it was 3 May she wanted to know if it was solved and I said yes it had been evaluated as the satellite ECHO II. 

She said that was not the one she meant, the one I was talking about was the first satellite she had ever seen. The other report she and her sister made had three observations and would I please look it up and tell her what the evaluation was. Called her back and informed her that her sighting of 18 May 65 was an aircraft. She then talked to Major Quintanilla regarding the UFO reports. She wanted to know why the USAF turned down her request to be on Greg Wallace's show. Maj explained that there were too many requests for this nature for just one person to handle and that yes he had told Greg that he would not do it for others if he did it for Greg when he must do it for all the others. Major explained that there were only the four of us on the project. She wanted to know if we thought she was a crackpot. Replied no. She wanted to know about satellites and why they sometimes appeared irregular lighting when passing overhead. Major explained that some of these were pocket beacons, fragments etc and that the light did not always show on them when they did this. They were quite satisfied with the answers Major Quintanilla gave them.
