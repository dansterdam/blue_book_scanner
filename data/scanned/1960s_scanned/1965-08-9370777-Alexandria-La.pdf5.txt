The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It seems to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book report, that contains only typed text.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
MILITARY PERSONNEL OF KEESLER AIR FORCE BASE,
BILOXI, MISSISSIPPI, STATED TO HAVE SEEN AN OBJECT IN THE SKY
OVER ALEXANDRIA, LOUISIANA, ON 9 AUGUST 1965.
THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, HAVING
BLUE-GREEN LIGHTS AROUND THE RIM, AND ALSO HAVING A RED LIGHT
AT THE CENTER OF THE OBJECT. IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SILVER
DOLLAR HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. THE OBJECT WAS SAID TO BE MOVING
IN A STRAIGHT DIRECTION AT A RAPID RATE OF SPEED AND ALTITUDE.
THEY COULD NOT GIVE US AN EXACT ESTIMATE OF THE SPEED AND
ALTITUDE. THEY WERE UNABLE TO GIVE A BETTER ACCOUNT OF THE OBJECT
SINCE NO ONE HAD A CAMERA AVAILABLE AT THE TIME. THEY COULD NOT
EXPLAIN WHAT THE OBJECT WAS.
