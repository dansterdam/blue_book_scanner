The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text from the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Sound: dull hum 
b. Color: dull white

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow besides the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

When standing a small light rapidly moved up & down.  When stationary a slight oscillation was visible.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One) a. Fuzzy or blurred
           b. (Little or bright)? No
           c. Sharply outlined
           d. Don't remember

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
One (or perhaps two) - an airplane with two tail lights blinking on & off alternately at the plane moved. Estimated 25 or 30 sec. traveled estimated 50 or 75 degree arc, estimated glide plane to be between 1 & 1 1/2 miles away.
