FEET IN RED ABOUT 7 - 2ý FEET IN HEIGHT, SHAPED LIKE A CRESCENT WITH A VERTICLE ARROW AND HORIZONTAL LINE UNDERNEATH. HE STATED THAT THE OBJECT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AND THEN FLEW OFF IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION FOLLOWING THE CONTOUR OF THE GULLY. OBJECT 7-2ý FEET LONG. SHORTLY AFTERWARD, SGT. CHAVES ARRIVED ON THE SCENE IN RESPONSE TO A CALLER RADIO CALL. HE OBSERVED NO OBJECT, BUT HE DID REPORT SOME SLIGHT DEPRESSIONS IN THE GROUND AND AN APPARENTLY BURNED BRUSH IN THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING. ALSO, THERE WERE SOME TYPE OF TRACKS NOTED IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA.

COMMENTS
VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS WERE CONTACTED IN THE AREA; HOWEVER, NO SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT OR HELICOPTERS WERE IN THE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. THERE WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL OF UNIDENTIFIED REPORTED BY LOCAL RADAR INSTALLATIONS. THERE WAS NO UNUSUAL METEOROLOGICAL ACTIVITY; THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR; HOWEVER, IT WAS SOMEWHAT WINDY.
A LABORATORY ANALYSIS WAS MADE OF THE BURNED BUSH AND THE SOIL ABOUT THE DEPRESSIONS WITH NO INDICATION OF RADIATION BEING NOTED. NO CHEMICALS WERE FOUND IN THE SOIL THAT WOULD INDICATE A TYPE OF PROPELLANT FOR THE OBSERVED OBJECT. CONTACT WAS MADE WITH A F.B.I. AGENT AND IT WAS HIS OPINION THAT THE TRACKS OBSERVED WERE, INDEED, FRESH.
THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGHTINGS REPORTED DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS; HOWEVER, IN EACH CASE THE SIGHTING WAS DETERMINED TO BE HOAXES OR NATURAL PHENOMENA. TWO OF THESE REPORTS WERE DETERMINED TO BE HOAXES.
ALTHOUGH THE SIGHTING APPEARS TO BE THE OBSERVATION OF SOME TYPE OF EXPERIMENTAL CRAFT, ALL ATTEMPTS TO REACH SUCH A CONCLUSION WERE INCONCLUSIVE. NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE WAS UNCOVERED TO SUBSTANTIATE THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A CRAFT AT THE PARTICULAR TIME. AS SUCH, THIS CASE IS CARRIED AS UNIDENTIFIED SINCE FROM THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION THERE IS NO EXPLANATION.
