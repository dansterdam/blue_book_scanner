The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or note.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The motion of the object was very erratic, no pattern or direction.. It would dart around for some time and then stop as if to check out its surroundings and then take off again in a burst of speed. on one occasion it stopped and hovered for approximately 10 seconds before taking off again at a high rate of speed. I would estimate the size of the object to be approximately 20-30 feet in diameter. It had a bright luminous surface, no apparent wings or tail, was circular in shape, and produced no sound which could be detected from where I was observing it. The sighting lasted approximately 15-20 minutes."
