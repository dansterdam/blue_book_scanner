More UFO Sightings Are Reported Over Wide Area
By the Associated Press
State officers and the military are investigating more unidentified flying objects.
The reports came from Socorro, the Espanola area, and Almagordo, N.M.
Vigil said investigators from Kirtland Air Force Base at Almagordo have been investigating some of the reports.
All of the reported sightings were similar to that they described flames surrounding the craft when seen on the ground for longer periods.
An unidentified girl, about 18, told Socorro officers Bill Flyind that she saw an object like a "flying saucer" fly away from the city officer's home Sunday night, where the officer had attempted to photograph it. She said she ran about 200 feet from the fire, when she thought the flashlight she was wearing became too bright.
About the report from Gallegos, State Police Capt. Martin Vigil said, "There was definitely something there." Gallegos, 35, who told of seeing an object early Sunday morning, said it "made a rumbling noise" as it took off. 
The latest report received a report from two men traveling in the same area. Satancias said that the object they saw "definitely was not an airplane, had swooped down toward trees" and then "took off rapidly toward the stars."
Although the object Gallegos saw was not that large as he first thought it to be, Vigil said there was no doubt in his mind that the officer did see something. "And the object Satancias reported was something very unusual," Vigil said.
