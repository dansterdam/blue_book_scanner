Text from the document:

Its elevation, seemed to vary, and it bounced back and forth. Its estimate of elevation was 10°-15°. It didn't seem to be far, and it was low, according to the witnesses. The object was about 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed for about 5-6 minutes. The witness said the object in question was 3-4 times the brightness of the full moon. (The nearest objects, buildings and Sheldon Hope's watched the object, later joined by Sgt. Minor). Sgt. Minor (from Luke Gruner's squadron) reported that the object stopped at one point and appeared to be on fire. It was moving and was fairly low, but it wasn't as bright as the stronger spotlights on the ground. The object became smaller as it moved away, and at one point the witnesses estimated its distance at 5 miles. According to Sgt. Minor, the object was bigger than "Venus" which he said was a large, bright object.

Later, two star-like objects were seen moving from N-S. They first moved part of the way, then were just hovering and then the other one started moving. One of the witnesses said the larger object seemed to shoot out between them from the larger body. Later the larger object again appeared on the scene, The time and the object were again observed. The passage north and south continued until the object went an estimated 10 minutes and then reappeared and disappeared in the distance. The object seen was considerably larger than "Venus" which he said was a very bright star in the sky.
