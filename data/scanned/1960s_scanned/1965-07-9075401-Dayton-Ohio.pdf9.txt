"Mme. S. Affiad alerted her friends on Mr. Normandy, sont us this interesting tetter from the October 1965 issue of the Tunisian magazine "SOURCES" (in French by J. Vuilleque), "On July 8, 1965, a housewife and person in Feriana (Tunisia) saw a luminous machine of about 5,000 meters. It was transluscent and the edges were more condensed than the centre, according to the statement of L'aerostore office official who had observed the object through a theodolite.
The machine was revolving slowly on its axis, giving out small circles in such a way that it appeared to be moving smoothly. It remained in place for about fifteen minutes.
The control tower at the aerodrome of El-Aouina warned all possible collision.
On the arrival of small clouds, the UFO rose slowly towards the north west without noise, and without leaving any trace of its passage. (T.S.S.)"
