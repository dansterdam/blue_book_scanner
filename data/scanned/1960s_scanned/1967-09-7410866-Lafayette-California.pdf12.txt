1. This replies to your letter concerning your observation of an unidentified object on 5 September 1967.

2. While reviewing our correspondence files we found your letter in which you reported seeing an unidentified object on 5 September 1967. Because of an error, your sighting was not investigated at that time. We include over $10,000 calls and investigations a year, so this oversight is understandable. This has kept us from investigating your observation. However, if you would like us to investigate your sighting, we will investigate any reports we receive in an attempt to determine the stimulus for your observation.

3. If you do not require reporting your observation to the Air Force, once again, please excuse us for not responding to your correspondence earlier.
