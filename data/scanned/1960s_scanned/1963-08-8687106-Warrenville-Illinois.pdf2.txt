Dear Sir:

I read this evening in the newspaper a write-up about a strange sighting of a large, strange glow, moving rather slowly through the sky. I wish to report to you that on that evening I was outside looking up at the sky and had this strange phenomenon. It was outside our home, and I noticed it about 8:10 PM and watched it for several minutes. It moved rather slowly in a southeasterly direction and at times seemed to be brighter at the front than at the rear. I would estimate that it was up about 15 to 20 seconds later, although perhaps a minute or so later, I noticed the Bank Manager across the street outside looking up at the sky at the same phenomenon. I told him about it and he said he had just observed it. So it appears that others in the neighborhood saw the same thing. 

It flashed about 3 times before it disappeared. It flashed about 3 times before it disappeared. I was excited and called my husband to come out and see it, but by the time he came out it had disappeared. The object seemed to be solid in appearance and not like an airplane or satellite. The sky was clear and there was no moon at the time. I would estimate the time it was visible to be in about 20 to 30 seconds. It seemed to be traveling faster than an airplane but not as fast as a shooting star. When it disappeared, it was rather sudden and I was disappointed that I could not observe it longer. I did not notify the police or any other agency about it. 

This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this and I was quite excited about it. I would be interested in any information you may have on it or if it has been reported by others in the area. If you would like any additional information, please let me know.

Sincerely,
