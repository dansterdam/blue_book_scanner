27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the observed object or objects. Show the direction of travel of the object(s) by drawing an arrow, and indicate the elevation (height) of the object(s) above the horizon by placing a number at the end of the arrow, which will show the angle of elevation.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
