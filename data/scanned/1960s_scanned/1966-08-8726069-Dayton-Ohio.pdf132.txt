14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound - like a solid object being rubbed on a glass surface b. Color - white, brilliant and glowing.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. (If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object was covered by the match head?): About 1/5 the size of the full moon, very distinct and visible.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving: [A drawing is included showing an oval-shaped object with an arrow pointing to the left.]
