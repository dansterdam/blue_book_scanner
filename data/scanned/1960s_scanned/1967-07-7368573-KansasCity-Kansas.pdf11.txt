le. Colonel Hector Quintanilla - 2 - August 5, 1969

Were the kind of phosphorescent sparks so characteristic of the explosion? I am certain that observations at this position were part of the explosion. Some of the falling debris could have exploded under the impact of the body landing.

The foregoing is my analysis for what it is worth. I

With reference to the Jefferson City sighting, I am certain of the interpretations which the principal observer or observers reported. 

Estimates of size and distance mean absolutely nothing. One cannot help but wonder about the man's eye condition. However, I was somewhat surprised that he said the object was as large as the moon. A person seeing such a reflection of the moon's surface could instantly recognize the characteristic featurso of the moon. At no time does he indicate that he stopped the car, got out and observed, or used binoculars or a telescope. Most certainly the question should have been asked, "If so, why didn't you stop the car?" Otherwise, how does he know it was the top down? Otherwise, how does he know it was the top down? Otherwise, how does he know it was the top down? Otherwise, how does he know it was the top down? Otherwise, how does he know it was the top down? Otherwise, how does he know it was the top down?

He should like to know what his information is that the lighting conditions were such that the object could have been easily visible and clearly seen. I do not think he must have been some of the UFO books that insist that such sightings are always of extraterrestrial origin.

It certainly could have been a plastic balloon, if so it could have been quite large in size, and visible for some distance. An a final comment, the statement in his interview about the means of his departure from the scene remains a mystery.
