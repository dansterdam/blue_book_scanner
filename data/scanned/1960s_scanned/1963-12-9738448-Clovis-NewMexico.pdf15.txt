Ruby "Rings" Over NZ
V. C. Burnett reported in a letter to the Rongotea, N.Z. Land Press, that on 10-15 p.m. on 9-5-63, he saw traveling slowly in an east-west direction, low enough to be visible through trees, a series of glowing, pulsating, ruby red colored objects in the space between the treetops which were clearly discernible. The objects appeared to accelerate slightly at intervals. While Burnett was observing them, they moved slightly to the left and made a slight detour to the Norrogowa. They then moved on out of sight. He prevailed a view of it for about 3 minutes.
