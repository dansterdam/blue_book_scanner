a short account of the transiently observed flying saucers of June 29, 1964 in the Pacific at about: longitude 147 west and latitude 26 north.

The observer is a dialogue in an air-plane which he was in a long way out over the Pacific on a flight between Hawaii and the West Coast of the United States. The observer notes that there were at least three saucers or discs that were seen alternately by the pilot and co-pilot of the airplane. The saucers were observed for several minutes as they maneuvered about the airplane at a distance of several miles. The saucers were described as shiny, metallic and disc-shaped. 

The report ends with a signature that has been redacted.
