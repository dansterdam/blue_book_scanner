The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document analyzing chemical samples.

Analysis of different portions of the sample by chemical methods did not show the presence of nitrates in the samples.
3. Chemical analysis of two samples, a mineral-like material and an organic material found in the vicinity showed them to be:
a. Slag. This material is commonly found around iron foundries.
b. Polystyrene.
III. CONCLUSIONS
1. The sample is non-homogeneous.
2. Chemical analysis of the sample submitted showed it to be man made
a. Finely divided, high purity aluminum does not occur in nature.
b. Polystyrene, metherylaite is a commercially available chemical compound.
3. The sample is not a sour batch of resin based paint because paint manufacturers
a. Add components to restore the desired formulation of a particular resin paint, or
b. Sell the one batch of paint at cost as a "closing out of stock" sale.
4. Aluminum does not occur in nature but results from the reduction of water with finely divided aluminum at low temperatures, about 700 degrees F. ("Aluminum Properties," ALCOA Research Lab. 1960 AD No. 220599-J)
5. Analysis of different organic portions showed the presence of polysachyl methcacrylate throughout.
6. The possible origin cannot be determined from these chemical data.
IV. RECOMMENDATIONS
None, data merely submitted.
