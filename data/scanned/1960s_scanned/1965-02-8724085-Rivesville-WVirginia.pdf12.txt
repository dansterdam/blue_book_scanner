STATEMENT:
On the night of January 8, 1965 I was driving home from work and coming over a hill on State Route 73 near Rivesville, West Virginia, I saw an unusual light in the night sky, and I stopped my car to observe it more closely. At first I thought it was an airplane, but it did not have the normal blinking lights and it was hovering without any apparent motion. It appeared to be egg-shaped and seemed to be luminous, not reflecting light. I watched it for several minutes and it moved slowly across the sky, finally disappearing behind the trees. This was the strangest thing I have ever seen in the sky, and I am at a loss to explain what it could have been. I have no idea of what it might have been, but it was certainly not an ordinary aircraft. I would be glad to discuss this further with anyone who might be interested in my observations.
