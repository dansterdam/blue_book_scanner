There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report.

and Chief Stewart of Glenview Public Affairs (Navy counter-
part of 1802), court of these men had any report of a UFO
being reported on 28 or 29 October. It seems logical to me 
that, as this thing is alleged to have been seen at 60 mph, somebody at O'Hare should have seen it.

The Chief Givinon discontinued conversation concerning velocity of the
GC:320 and time observed (stated 65 minutes in letter and
95 minutes on the telephone) warrant no further comments.

4. Also of interest is the fact that Mr. mentioned twice in his
conversation with the investigating officer that he did not observe the
moon but that the stars were quite bright. However, the moon should
have been visible since it was in the Eastern sky at about 65 degrees 
elevation at the beginning of the sighting and was nearly a full moon
(full moon Oct 25).

5. This sighting is being carried in Project Blue Book files under the
category of "Conflicting Data".
