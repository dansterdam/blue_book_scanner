The image does not contain any photographs. It is a page from an old UFO report document that appears to be describing a sighting of a fleet of UFOs in July 1961 near El Paso, Texas. The text describes the observed objects moving at high speed, glowing a deep red, and appearing to drop down toward the observer rapidly. There is no mention of any human faces or identifiable individuals in the text.

A fleet of UFOs appeared late one afternoon in July 1961, to an observer driving west along Highway 54 from El Paso, Texas, to Alamogordo, New Mexico. It had been raining in the mountains, and wind and dust storms had forced the driver to slow down to less than 60 mph. Suddenly, moving between patches of dark cloud in the western sky, Drifting toward the outskirts of Alamogordo, he started to see a formation of three sources of bright white light, glowing a deep red, were moving at high speed, and seemed to be as high as the clouds. Rapidly revising all his first estimates of size, height, and speed, he recognized their true identity. They were merely a group of tumbleweeds that had been carried aloft in the strong winds, and these glowing particles were the getting sunlight reflecting from their dried and brittle stems.
