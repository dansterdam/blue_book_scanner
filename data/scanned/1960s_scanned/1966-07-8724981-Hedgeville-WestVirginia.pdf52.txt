I appreciate the fact that the object may have been a very high altitude, the aircraft, although the radar measurements increased the sky and the absence of any ground obstacles would indicate that this observation ( made by three scientists and myself) must possibly be of interest to you. Since data satellites are of interest and the air space explication techniques developed by this means might be of a nature as to warrant our attention, I should be interested to discuss the matter further directly and to do so.

Sincerely,
