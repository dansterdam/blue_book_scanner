Unidentified Flying Object
************
The weather in Monitor Valley Sunday night was as follows: the wind was calm, the sky absolutely clear, and the stars were bright. While observing the first-described object, I was outside of my home in Monitor Valley, Nevada, looking north in the sky like just above the horizon. The light was white, when the beam had focused in a downward vertical position, the object became completely dark and out of sight. There was a sound of no kind of any motor or engines. There was complete silence.
On September 27 I traversed the entire area where the object could have landed (a distance of about three miles from my observation position), but found no evidence of landing gear, impressions or any evidence that anyone or anything had been there. This particular area is quite inaccessible, I found no evidence of any truck or vehicle tracks, there was no evidence that man or anyone had been there, and within some time after that date, the area experienced heavy rains which would have demolished any evidence that might have been left.
