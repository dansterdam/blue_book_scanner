Family Reports Sighting Saucer
SYDNEY, Australia (Reuters) - A family chorus of howls accompanied the sudden appearance of a flying saucer-shaped object over the family home and brought them rushing out of their residence to see the flying saucer hovering over their home for about 15 minutes before moving off. Two beams of light shone from the top and two from the bottom. It emitted two beams of light. The object remained over the farmyard for about 15 minutes before moving off. Two of the McLinlock boys, 15 and 20, admitted they were terrified before but lost it.
The incident was reported at Goonumbla, New South Wales.
