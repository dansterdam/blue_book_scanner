Transcription of the text in the document:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Silent
b. Color - White in the center, light blue a dull and hazy color all around it

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the hand of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how many match sticks' length would have covered the entire object? The object was so small that only about a half match stick could have covered its entire size

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
