The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch is a compass rose or wind rose diagram, which appears to be used to indicate the direction of an observed object. The smaller sketches on the bottom show a silhouette of a person standing in a landscape, and a landscape scene with hills or mountains.

The text in the document is as follows:

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE A CHECK MARK (X) AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHICH WAS SEEN, AND A STAR (â˜…) AT THE LOCATION FROM WHICH THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE.
THE LARGER SKETCH SHOWS THE COMPLETE COMPASS POINTS. REFER TO THIS IN LOCATING THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON AND THE OBSERVER'S LOCATION.
