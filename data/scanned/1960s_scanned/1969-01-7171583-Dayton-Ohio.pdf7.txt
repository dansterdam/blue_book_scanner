13. WHAT A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW. THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON IS UNUSUAL AND JAGGED, AND INDICATES THAT THE OBJECT OR VEHICLE APPEARS TO BE MOVING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE REGARDING THE SPEED AND DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS OBSERVED:  ABOUT AS LARGE AS A DIME WAS VIEWED AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREETLAMP OR TREE.  WHEN IT DISAPPEARED, IT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN EXTINGUISHED,  NOT FLOWN AWAY.  IT APPEARED TO BE A PINPOINT OF LIGHT.  IT APPEARED TO HAVE RISEN VERTICALLY AND THEN HOVERED MOMENTARILY BEFORE DISAPPEARING.
