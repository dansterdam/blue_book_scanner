There were 22 men watching the object which hovered very slowly about 50 to 100 ft above ground. It was bow shaped with a bright light in the middle. The object was about 30 ft long and 12 ft wide. It made no sound whatsoever. After hovering for about 5 minutes, it shot up at a terrific speed and was out of sight in seconds. The witness, who was one of the 22 men watching, said that the object was intelligently controlled.
