There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a typed letter from the Office of Information regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Paulding, Ohio.

Dear Mr. ***,

This letter acknowledges your letter of 8 October 1960 concerning certain information of 7 October relating to an unidentified flying object. Your letter contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion. However, we are aware that you and others saw the object of which you complained. A physical examination of the immediate area by the United States Air Force on 8 October revealed nothing to substantiate the report.

From the limited information contained in your letter, it is not possible to determine with any certainty whether the object you observed was of an extraterrestrial origin. The subject has been studied and given appropriate consideration by the General Condition of the United States Air Force, and the matter is now closed as far as you are concerned. In the absence of more tangible evidence, there is little further that can be done.

Would you please make an additional attempt to view the object and to obtain photographs to be forwarded with the questionnaire?

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER 
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Public Information Division
