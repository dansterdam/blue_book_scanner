The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page contains a questionnaire with questions about the observer's experience with the unidentified object. There is a hand-drawn sketch depicting "Lights Going Around Object" at the bottom of the page.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)   Yes   -   No   -   Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)   Yes   -   No   -   Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Whistling
b. Color - Greenish

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and cover as much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Could cover with thumbnail

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically indicate the direction the object was moving. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
