Arcturus Shines in Southern Sky
Several bright stars can be seen on June evenings. Most prominent is Arcturus, the second-brightest star in the northern sky. Others that are spica, Deneb, Vega and Capella, James Stokley reports.
Arcturus is quite bright in the south, a brilliant jewel-like star. It is the fourth-brightest star in the sky, outshone only by Sirius, Canopus and Alpha Centauri.
Arcturus is the chief star of the constellation Bootes, the herdsman. It is in the northern part of the southern sky, in almost the southernmost part of the region that is circumpolar from middle northern latitudes.
While Mars is the only planet visible, the constellations Scorpius, Ophiuchus and Libra are prominent in the southern sky. Antares, the bright red star in Scorpius, is conspicuous.
Arcturus is so bright that it can readily be seen in the twilight sky. With the naked eye, one can note that it has a golden or reddish color. This indicates that it is a star in the late stages of its life cycle, with a surface temperature somewhat cooler than the sun.
Arcturus Brightens Than Vega
Arcturus is so brilliant that it actually outshines Vega, the fifth-brightest star, which is also prominent in the northern sky. Only Sirius, Canopus and Alpha Centauri are brighter.
The color of Arcturus is a clue to its greater age compared to Vega and other bright stars. Arcturus is a "red giant" star, in the late stages of its life cycle, when it has expanded greatly in size but is cooler on the surface. Vega and most other bright stars are "main sequence" stars, still in their prime.
