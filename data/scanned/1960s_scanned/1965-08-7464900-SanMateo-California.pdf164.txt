First Night Color Shot Captures Flying Saucer
(Continued from Page 1)
o'clock Highâ€”Alan Godfrey, 21, was taking pictures of the strange aerial object when it terminated and arranged in a pattern. The object was then seen for an estimated 45 seconds.

Hayden Hewes, director of the Oklahoma City Ultrasonics section of International Flying Saucer Bureau, said the best explanation he could give was that the object was apparently a vehicle of some kind, possibly an experimental craft from another country.

When they recovered the film and processed it, it was found that it had indeed captured the flying saucer on color film. They had an excellent picture of the object and a relative picture of 3 other lights that were in the area at the time.
