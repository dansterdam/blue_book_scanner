I have absolutely no proof, except to support this man's allegations, that he received "the mickey mouse treatment" from Melvin Marshall which we would indicate that this is a harsh treatment. However, he appears to be perturbed by the fact that the duty officer could not specifically identify the light to which he referred to. According to the AFRLO investigation, the duty officer did not have to identify the light, it appears that the duty officer failed to satisfy or to the reporter, and evidently this too, has perturbed him to some extent. I probably used the wrong word when I said "derelict" in an investigational manner, in not being able to satisfy an interrogative reporter when he was merely thinking about this at length. I'm not too sure that he deserves an apology. However, I think it appropriate that we respond in some appropriate way to what he really feels is unfair treatment - any suggestions?
