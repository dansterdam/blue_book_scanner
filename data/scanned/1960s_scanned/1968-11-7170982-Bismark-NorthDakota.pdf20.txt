The image contains a simple line drawing that appears to be a schematic or diagram. It shows a large circular shape with some smaller shapes attached to it, labeled #1 and #2. The text below the diagram states that the angular size of the object would subtend or match the angular size of a dime held at arm's length, indicating that the object is being described in terms of its apparent size.
