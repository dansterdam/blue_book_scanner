Dear Sir,
A bit of information may be in order on the sighting mentioned in my telephone conversation with you on 7 Feb 64.
As you have probably heard, on 7 Feb 64, shortly after 9:00 pm, a witness reported seeing a bright light in the sky. The observer, Miss J. Z., was driving along U.S. Route 19, about 5 miles south of Rivesville, West Virginia, when she noticed the object.
She stated that the object appeared suddenly, seemingly just popping into view, and was much brighter than any star or planet. It was an intense white light, round or oval in shape, and remained stationary in the sky for several minutes. Then it began to move slowly and erratically, and its brightness seemed to fluctuate. After a few minutes, it disappeared rapidly. She estimated it was about 30-40 degrees above the horizon. No sound was heard.
The witness is a reliable person, and her description of the object and its behavior appears to be credible. There were no clouds in the sky at the time, and no other witnesses have been located.
I would appreciate any information or analysis you can provide on this sighting. Please let me know if you need any additional details.
Sincerely,
J. Plum
