The shared image does not contain any visible photograph. It appears to be a scanned page of an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

Dear Mr. S____,

In reviewing our cases for the month of October, we were unable to come to a definite conclusion as to the cause of your sighting of 12 October 65. Would you please fill out the attached UFD Form 1.4 and return it to me in the envelope provided.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Dear Major:

I am returning the enclosed form and am keeping one copy for our files. You do not enclose but two envelopes so I assume we should keep one copy.
