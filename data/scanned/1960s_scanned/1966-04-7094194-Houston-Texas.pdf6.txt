UFO Reclassified As Rice Freshman's UFO
Friday night's unidentified flying object over Southwest Houston was reclassified as a prank engineered by an enterprising Rice freshman. 
It turned out to be a prank engineered by an enterprising Rice freshman, E.B. Vanderbilt, a chemical engineering student, and witnessed the launching of two hydrogen-filled balloons carrying six railroad flares.
The incident was staged in the home by David Benkman, Dickinson; James DePrizio, Alla Loma; Dewayne Huckaby, Calumet City, Ill.; Mike McFarland, West Palm Beach, Fla.; Fred Jon Sackett, Houston; Harold Magnus, Fort Arthur.
A witness said the "saucers" was actually two hydrogen-filled balloons carrying six-foot frames of wood and aluminum covered with aluminum foil. Flashing red lights reported by viewers.
Newspaper, radio, television and police switchboards were swamped with calls shortly after 9:30 Friday from Southmest Houston residents who had observed the object.
In its Saturday morning story, The Houston Post quoted one witness, a Rice freshman, as saying he thought the object had been launched from the campus.
