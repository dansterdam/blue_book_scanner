MEMORANDUM

Bob:

Can you provide some information on which
to base a reply to this? 
Missile schedule revealed no shots on this
night (Dec 14th).
You might take a look at the interceptor (F-106)
path out of Dover,AFB (Del). They move in
the direction of Long Island and then proceed
out to see on an intercept....usually with
AB on all the way. Sometimes there a boom 
followed by engine racket...etc.
