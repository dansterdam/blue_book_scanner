That the undersigned as Mr. Dixon the citizen who
saw the unusual saucer-saucer come on sunday 
nov. 24, 1961. The disc 50 ft in diameter and
about 4 ft thick Was hovering about 50 ft above
the group till about 8:30 pm. When it suddenly
went straight up at a terrific speed and was
gone in a few seconds. My friend who was with
me saw the same things I did. And the others tell
they saw the same saucer also. Some gave the
same description as I do. I am sure it was not
a weather balloon or any other known object. It
was under intelligent control and not a natural
phenomena. My friends and neighbors can vouch
for me. My actual size was about  8 or 9 ft long 
including from the ground up. I saw thru the clear
glass all inside and could see 3 or 4 figures moving
around.
