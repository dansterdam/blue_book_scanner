There does not appear to be a photograph or image present in this document. The image shows a page from what seems to be an old UFO report document, with a handwritten response to the question "Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting."

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now proceed to extract all the textual content from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 6 Day 11 Month 1967 Year
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I saw a bright light in the sky, abo[ILLEGIBLE] I went outside and watched it for some time. It appeared to be [ILLEGIBLE] moving very slowly. At times it would stop and hover, then continue on. I'm quite sure it was not an aircraft, satellite, or anything [ILLEGIBLE] that I'm familiar with. I'm curious to know if anyone else in the area reported seeing the same thing.
