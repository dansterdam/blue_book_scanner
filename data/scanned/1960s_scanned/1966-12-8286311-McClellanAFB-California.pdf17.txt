The night was clear with just some thin high cirrus clouds. I first noticed the object at about 9:00 pm while driving toward McClellan AFB. It appeared to be about 3/4 the size of a full moon and was hovering motionless about 1000 feet above the ground. After observing it for about 5 minutes, it suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed on a northerly course and rapidly disappeared from view.
