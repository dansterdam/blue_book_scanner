There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from a document with handwritten text.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  September 23  1965
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I share your notification of all the sightings. Mention to the different departments, but they were men acknowledged before. I also notified our local newspapers to other news sightings. If you can tell me anything about it that I can be guided to.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
