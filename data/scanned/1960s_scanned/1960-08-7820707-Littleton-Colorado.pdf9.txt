August 20, 1960
Plum Creek Prison Camp

On August 17th at approximately 8 or 8:30 PM I went up in the forestry lookout tower to look around. About 9PM I saw a dull light above the horizon and it looked as though it was disappearing. Then it came back as a brighter light. This was observed by Mrs. -------------- and myself. The light appeared to fade and then come back as a brighter object, moving from right to left across the horizon. I lost sight of the light at times but it appeared to fade and then come back as a brighter object, moving rather quickly. It seemed to be headed in a southerly direction, disappearing from right to left at the same location. I followed it for many miles. I felt certain it was moving to my left, then upward. Because of it's pendulously slow at times, I lost it a number of times, and I managed to find it again.
