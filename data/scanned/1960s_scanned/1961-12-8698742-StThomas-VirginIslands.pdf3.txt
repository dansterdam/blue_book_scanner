The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a hand-drawn diagram with various sketches and annotations describing the observed UFO.

A - observed "comet"- blunt nosed - gaseous shroud trailing behind, appeared to increase in zenith - trail
B - Appeared again as A but smaller
C - Three sides observed distinctly brighter

The sketch shows multiple views of the observed UFO, including its apparent increase in size and changes in brightness over time.
