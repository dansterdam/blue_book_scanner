Dear ---

This is in reply to your letter of May 30, 1964. You reported seeing an object in the sky during the evening on that date.

The object which you described was observed by several other persons in the area at approximately 9:57 p.m. It was observed to move in a southeasterly direction at an estimated altitude of 2,000 - 2,500 feet above the horizon.

You both gave a very fine description of the object. However, the description made it possible to identify this aircraft quickly and positively.

Since the object has been identified, no further investigation is considered necessary.

Thank you for calling this matter to our attention.

Sincerely,

MASON U. JACKS
