Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your letter of November 11, 1966 to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base concerning an unidentified object was referred to this office for reply.

I honestly believe that individuals must witness an unusual phenomenon on several occasions before they can be considered to report the observation. There is no living or withholding of information by the Air Force. All data in our files on UFO sightings is made available to the public upon request. The availability of these documents has been limited, however, and the public has not been afforded the opportunity to review much of the data. There are occasions when investigators from the Air Force and scientists have not chosen to review our files, as they consider the data to contain nothing sensational-prone material. However, have not chosen to review our files.

I regret to advise that the Air Force cannot furnish any definitive information on unidentified aerial vehicles. The only information on which we base a scientific study is that contained in Officer's Reports or investigations of Sightings. We have furnished all pertinent scientific and technological data that could be channeled to Research and Development for further study. UFOs continue to be a problem which cannot be clearly identified or discovered by only a few sightings. It is suggested that your observations, if substantiated, may be of interest to the Air Force that our planes is being visited by extraterrestrial vehicles.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force. I hope you find this reply helpful.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
GEORGE F. FISHMAN, Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Division
