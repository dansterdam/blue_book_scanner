Dear Sirs:

I am writing this to let you know that I saw something on the night of Sept 16, 1965.

It was approximately 8:21 PM and I was standing outside looking around when I noticed an object in the sky. At first I thought it was just an airplane, but as I watched it, I realized it was moving in a very unusual manner. It would start and stop, move up and down, and side to side, much more quickly than any plane I have ever seen.

I watched it for several minutes, estimating the size to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object appeared to be a bright reddish-orange in color, and seemed to be hovering in the sky. 

I will be glad to provide any other details that may be of interest. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
