My wife and I saw an unusual light in the sky near Clearwater, Florida on the evening of July 8, 1964. It appeared to be hovering at a low altitude and then suddenly shot straight up at a very high rate of speed. 
[Redacted]
a great deal of interest in this incident.
I truly hope this report will be of some value to your investigation.
Sincerely,
