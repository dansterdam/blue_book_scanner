There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing handwritten text describing an unidentified flying object sighting.

As this point it went out of sight. I said to my wife as I turned away from the window towards her "Did you hear that?" again louder and she replied "yes". She wanted to know what it was and I stated "It was a 1960", with the noise still in the background but getting fainter.  I contacted the telephone operator in Smithfield, as I was telling her that I had heard and seen she stated "I think I can hear it" or "I can hear it"...just to be sure...because I was wondering if this whole situation was a dream or nightmare...I asked her "You can? are you sure?" she replied "yes, I can hear it". During the time that I was speaking with the telephone operator the noise was deep in the background...the noise ceased for perhaps 5 seconds or so and then recurred for a short time before going out of hearing distance. At this point I told the telephone operator that I should contact someone and notify them of this situation.  I was trying to decide whether to notify law enforcement or the Air Force. I decided on the Air Force. I got her to get Air Force Langley Field, Hampton, Virginia. The operator answered for Langley and stated what needed to be done and he connected me to the airman who received UFO's and I again told him what I had seen and he wanted a description and I gave it to him.  

When I returned to bed it was 3:30AM January 17, 1969. I had not noticed any weather conditions or if the moon or any stars were shining even though it had been plenty clear earlier for me to see the unidentified object out of my window.
