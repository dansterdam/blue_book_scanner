The image contains a diagram with two sketches - one showing the movement of an object and another showing a circular shape. There is also text below the sketches, but no photographic image is present in this particular page.

27. Figure an object was above the horizon (degrees) when you first saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

25. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Please an "X" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

26. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arrayed, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
