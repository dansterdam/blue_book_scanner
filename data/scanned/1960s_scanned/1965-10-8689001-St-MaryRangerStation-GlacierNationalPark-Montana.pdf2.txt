DEAR MR. â€”

This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you sighted on or about October 1, 1965. 

The duration, direction of flight, and general description of the object were noted. A careful search of our records has failed to reveal any information which would substantiate that this particular object was man-made or artificial. It is indicated that no such object was tracked on radar or visual observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. I trust this information is helpful.

Sincerely,
JOHN L AULDING
Chief, General Liaison Division
