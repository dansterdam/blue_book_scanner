Project Blue Book: HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WAS SEEN. DESCRIBED AS BRIGHT OBJECT MOVING IN STRAIGHT LINE 
22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or coin's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you held this comparison of the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS COMPARISON. THE OBJECT WAS TOO FAR AWAY AND TOO BRIGHT TO ESTIMATE ITS SIZE IN THIS MANNER.
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? I t SIMPLY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN A STRAIGHT UPWARD MOTION. 
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object you saw.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WOULD GIVE SUCH AN APPEARANCE. IT WAS A BRIGHT OBJECT MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE UPWARD, UNLIKE ANYTHING I AM FAMILIAR WITH.
