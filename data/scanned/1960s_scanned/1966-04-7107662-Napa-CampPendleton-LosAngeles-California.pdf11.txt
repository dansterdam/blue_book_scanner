STATE REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT OBSERVED AT 2300 HOURS
ON APPROXIMATELY 21 MARCH 1956 WITHIN BOUNDARIES OF SAN
DIEGO, CALIFORNIA
On approximately 2110 hours on 21 March 1956 the writer received a phone call from Lt. Garrison, Pendleton, Marine Corps Air Station, who reported that observers at Camp Pendleton had reported an unidentified object in the sky. The object was first sighted over Laguna Beach, California, moving in an easterly direction, and was tracked across the sky by observers at Camp Pendleton and at the Los Angeles Interceptor Center, where it was picked up on radar. The object was described as moving in an erratic manner, zigzagging and changing in elevation. It was in sight for approximately 15-20 minutes. The object was described as a single light source, varying in intensity from bright to dim, sometimes showing a reddish hue. At times the object appeared to be two separate objects, one apparently higher than the other. It was lost to visual observation in the haze, but the radar track continued. The exact nature of the object could not be determined. The radar track was measurable, and the object appeared to be traveling at a speed in excess of 2000 mph. The description and the radar tracking would indicate that the object was not a conventional aircraft and should be classified as an unidentified aerial phenomenon.
