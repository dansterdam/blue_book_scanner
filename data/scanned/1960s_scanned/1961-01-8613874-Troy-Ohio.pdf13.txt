20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. Was this the first time you had ever seen this object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words, the common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. This would be helpful in visualizing the size and general appearance of the object.
