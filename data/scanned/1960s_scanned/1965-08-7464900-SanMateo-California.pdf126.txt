Here is the text output from the document:

The undersigned reports that at 8:20 P.M. August 7, 1965, he observed a strange object that appeared to be stationary in the sky. The object was approximately 1/2 the size of the full moon and had a bright white light around the edge, with a dull center. The object changed from a round to an oval shape while it was observed. It moved across the sky in a slow and direct manner, then stopped and hovered for a few minutes before moving off to the south at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes.
