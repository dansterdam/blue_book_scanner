There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

I've read through the text in the document and transcribed it as follows:

I've not written any report yet and I am convinced that UFOs are not from this world and I think 1 may have landed in my yard on 9-14-64. Please send me much info on reports and anything I can do in the matter.

Second UFO in 9-14-64
