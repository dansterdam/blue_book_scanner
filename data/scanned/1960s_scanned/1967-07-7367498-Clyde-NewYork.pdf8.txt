Dear Sir:

I saw an object on the road near Clyde that I would not call a UFO but I would like to report it anyway. It was a quite unusual thing. I'm not very good at explaining things for reporting purposes, so I hope that this information can be of some help to you or someone else that may be interested in this sort of thing. I saw them and explain things better.

Sincerely yours,
