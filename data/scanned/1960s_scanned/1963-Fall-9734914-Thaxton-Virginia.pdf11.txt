My dear Major:

The U.F.O.
My latest of 1-16-65, enclosing negatives as requested, because it appears to have been a large flame, with many lights, and noise - had a strange tail about 15ft long, same as my sighting on 12-23-64, with a flare in the sky over my garage and some sort of projecting from it, about 90 ft high over Bald Mt., Va., which I guess was 8 miles away. The flame itself did not appear to be as wonderful as the other, not moving quite so rapidly.
That which did not report as unusual -
one case which I shall log day for 1963, I was disturbed by the motion near the door of my garage, thinking 8 feet flying saucer with a flapping or oscillating motion, similar to the thing about 10 O'clock position on the sky, and within 2 seconds I did hear out of the 4 ft south next to my house. It was high speed, but flashy, up over Bald Mt., Va., which was 8 miles away.
