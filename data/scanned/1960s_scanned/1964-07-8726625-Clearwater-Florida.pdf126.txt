There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document that appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to extract and output the text from the document:

At 3:13 p.m. on June 23, 1964, the undersigned interviewed Mr. [REDACTED], 1005 Magnolia Drive, Clearwater, Florida, concerning a UFO sighting which he had reported to NICAP.

Mr. [REDACTED] stated that on June 22, 1964, at approximately 5:50 p.m., he was sitting on his front porch watching his son mow the lawn. Suddenly, he noticed a bright, metallic, saucer-shaped object in the sky at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet. The object appeared to be rotating and oscillating side to side. After observing the object for about a minute, it accelerated at a high rate of speed and climbed out of sight.

Mr. [REDACTED] stated that he was quite sure the object was not a conventional aircraft, and he has had previous experience in observing aircraft while serving in the U.S. Air Force. He reported the sighting to NICAP in Washington, D.C., and was later interviewed by local Air Force representatives.
