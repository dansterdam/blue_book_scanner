MEMO FOR THE RECORD

21 December 1967

Captain G. C. Davis called and wanted to know if we received his report.

He said that he saw the first object for about 2 minutes. At first it looked like an aircraft with landing lights on, then it started streaming sparks.

Captain Davis compared it to grinding steel on an emory wheel.

He said he saw the saw the second object, it was going up and down. The object moved across and started to stream orange flames. It passed below the horizon and disappeared just before it hit the ground. Ninety seconds later it reappeared, rose up to their altitude and flew parallel with them for approximately twenty minutes.

Captain Davis said that he had seen satellite decays many times before and that he didn't think these were satellite decays. Captain will call back later today.

If we send him a 117 he will give it to a           . He stated that he would like Dr. Menzel's address so he could send him a copy of the sighting.
