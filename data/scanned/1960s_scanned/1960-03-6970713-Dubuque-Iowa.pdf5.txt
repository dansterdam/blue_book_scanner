SUBJECT: *******
Comments on **** Letter

1. The unidentified letter and report from **** has been reviewed by ATIC. It is believed no further comment or action is required.

2. In reply to your query regarding contact with Strategic Air Command regarding the apparent incidents in the Dubuque, Iowa area, ATIC did contact several radar stations in the Midwest, as well as the Chicago Air Defense Sector. However, no definite sightings or information that they had no record of B-52's flying in the Dubuque, Iowa area on 4 or 10 March 1956.

3. It is believed the information to the effect that there were sightings in the Dubuque areas without this knowledge of radar stations and the Chicago Air Defense Sector. It is not understandable by ATIC how such flights could be made without the Chicago Air Defense Sector's knowledge.
