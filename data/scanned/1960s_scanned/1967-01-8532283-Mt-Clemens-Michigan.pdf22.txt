STATEMENT

As of 1200P, 13 January 1967, I have been unable to obtain any of the original prints of the UFO sighted near Selfridge AFB on 9 January 1967.

On 10 January, I personally visited the site and requested these prints from the boys' Mother, Mrs.\Those M. , who stated that the did not have them in her possession., The boys' Father. The boys' Mother and Father are divorced.

On 11 January, I called Mrs.nd requested permission to re-visit the site and photograph for investigation purposes. Permission was granted, but I was still unable to obtain permission to visit the site was granted, but I was still unable to obtain the prints. Although I stated that the importance of these prints to our investigation, she stated that she would think about it and call me.

On 12 January, I was called by Mr.3ARRINGER, contacted by Mrs.who stated that he had talked with Mr.4, who stated that he and the boys' Mother had agreed to allow the Air Force to photograph the area. She stated that he thought the Air Force should not be granted access to this and she would think about it and let me know.

On 13 January, I called Mrs. to offer her a complete set of enlargements to exchange for one of the original prints. She stated she was supposed to visit a set of enlargements from the Detroit News but she would call me back.

I feel that further contact at this time would produce unfavorable results.
