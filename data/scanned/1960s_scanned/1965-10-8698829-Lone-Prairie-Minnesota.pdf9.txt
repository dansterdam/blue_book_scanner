Perhaps it would be better if I gave you a detailed account of the incident which I answered to this questionnaire. I was on Minnesota Highway 27 when I went around a curve and my attention was drawn to a bright light ahead of me. I looked up and saw this object setting in the middle of the road. It was around 7:15 PM because I had just checked my watch about 5 minutes before. My car almost stopped as I neared it, and I finally decided to stop about 20 ft. from it. My kind of math and being able to tell distances quite accurately, this object appeared an estimated 25-30 ft. in diameter. The front of it seemed transparent. The top of it had blinking lights. I can not be sure because I decided that nobody would believe me so I decided that I would not look it over and have some vivi evidence. I then got out of my car with the idea to go up to it and rock the center of gravity and sound it over to rock it, when the front of my car and stopped with no further lights going any further because these little "treasures" cam around behind loud and speed in front of the vehicle. I can not be sure because I do not see any eyes or any sort. I know that I was looking at what I have faintly watched. You must believe me!
