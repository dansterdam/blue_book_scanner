MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJ: UFO Photographs by Lt Marano 
Lt Marano called in and said he has evidence on 1 May 1968, 1515 hours. Lt Marano was at work, therefore, Lt Marano left a message asking to come to Dayton to turn over his photographs.

On 2 May 1968, he returned Lt Marano's call, and we could find no evidence to come to Dayton and see Lt Colonel B Colonel Quintanilla with regards to his photographs and also ask him about some of the articles that have appeared in the various magazines on UFOs.

Lt Marano said he has been seeing UFOs for three summers now, the night before Christmas and throughout the year. Some of them looked like aircraft lights but he couldn't do anything as they seemed to be aircraft lights. However, something showed on his camera and he wanted to come to Dayton on 6 May. Lt Marano explained that he was not sure whether the Colonel would be in then or not so he would leave a message with his wife on 3 May.

On 3 May 1968 Lt Marano informed that Lt Colonel Quintanilla would be in the office on the morning of 6 May 1968 and was expecting his visit.

On 6 May 1968, Lt Colonel Quintanilla visited the Aerial Phenomena Office and spoke to Lt Colonel Quintanilla and Lt Marano. He related his past sightings were quite vague. He has been seeing them for three years now and his neighbors know about them. He is not a member of NICAP or any other organization. However, on his own he has contacted different police departments and read of the UFO reports they have received. He tried to relate some of the information he has learned.
