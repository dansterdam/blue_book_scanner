memo for the record                                 2 August 1968

At 0900 hours, 2 August 1968, Lt Marano received a telephone call 
from Col DeGore (Ispelling) McGuire APB, ext 3360/3371, in regards 
to a UFO sighting of 23 July 1968 by [redacted].

Col DeGore wanted to know if we wanted a formal investigation into 
the matter of the Duty Officer who allegedly told a UFO observer 
that he had been drinking too much or if it was an informal 
request.  If it is to be treated as a formal request, Col DeGore 
said that we would have to submit a formal letter stating the allegations 
and our fulfillment requirements.  I told Col DeGore that I felt that 
an informal reply would be sufficient.
