Summers the Big Sky Country is a land of natural wonders. Fishing is one of the most popular sports. MONTANA offers some of the finest fishing in the United States. Streams, rivers and lakes teem with trout and other game fish. This is a 350,000-acre wilderness area, eight wilderness areas and 34 primitive areas awaiting the fisherman and camper. There are five stream generating dams on the Missouri River in Montana power system. Much of Montana's $150,000,000 agricultural income is directly related to irrigated crops. The irrigated acres are harvested each year and is the second largest in the nation. Giant Trout are the specialty of the Big Horn River which flows from the north entrance of Yellowstone Park through Montana to join the Bighorn River at Bighorn, Montana. There are large rainbow, brown and brook trout in these waters. Crystal clear waters under the Big Sky beckon the angler to fish and dream.
