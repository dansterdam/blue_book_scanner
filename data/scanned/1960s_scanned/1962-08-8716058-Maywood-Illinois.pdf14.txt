The object became about 3 to 4 times larger when directly overhead. It seemed to be revolving or spinning, with a smooth surface or top section and appeared to have a lower section which lighted up intermittently. It moved in a slowing down, speeding up pattern. The object was brighter than the daylight sky and could be seen clearly against the sky. It seemed transparent or translucent at times. The object was observed for a period of 5 to 10 minutes. It disappeared rather suddenly, going straight up out of sight.
