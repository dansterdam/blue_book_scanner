Transcribed text from the document:

"This appeared as a daytime sighting around 5:20 PM, lasting for approximately 10 minutes. The object was described as a metallic, disc-shaped, and fast-moving object, larger than a passenger jet, and banding at the edge. The object was observed by at least four witnesses and was reported to have alternately appeared and disappeared from view. More details are given regarding the object's movements and behavior, such as a "wibbling" or oscillating motion and a sudden burst of speed. The observer notes that the object was much faster than any conventional aircraft, and that it appeared to be intelligently controlled. The document suggests that this sighting was investigated as part of Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO reports."
