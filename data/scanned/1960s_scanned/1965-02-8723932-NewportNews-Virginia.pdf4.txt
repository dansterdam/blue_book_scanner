3. Numerous aircraft were in the area at the time sighting.

4. This sighting was observed by Captain William L. Bichop (DOC-9), Langley AFB, Virginia. Mr.* * * * * stated that he observed an object, larger than the moon, for approximately ten minutes before calling his neighbor to see it. He turned to tell his neighbor what he had seen. The neighbor had disappeared. The neighbor had also investigated the sighting and had described seeing the object which appeared to be larger than the moon and was described as being unusual for the time of evening. The observed object could have been an aircraft with landing lights on flying toward the observer which would make it appear relatively stationary.
