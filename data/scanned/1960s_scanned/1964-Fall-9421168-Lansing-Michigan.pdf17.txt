ROY CAMPBELLY
Rumors had circulated in Augusta, Georgia, that something strange had been sighted in the sky during the evening of August 3, 1964. Campbelly, a local resident, later reported that he and several other persons had observed a large, bright, oval-shaped object maneuvering in the sky over Augusta. Campbelly stated that the object appeared to be metallic and was emitting a series of colored lights. He said that the object made a sudden, high-speed turn and disappeared from view. Campbelly further stated that the object did not resemble any conventional aircraft that he had ever seen.
