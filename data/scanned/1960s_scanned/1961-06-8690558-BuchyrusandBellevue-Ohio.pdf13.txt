Dear sir:
Reference is made to my reports, dated 17 July 1951, concerning the unidentified object sightings near Bucyrus and Bellevue, Ohio, on 17 July 1951.
The sightings of my son near Titusville, Florida, on 25 May 1951 have been investigated. As soon as the investigation had been completed, a report was submitted by the project to this office.
Could you provide more details on these sightings and the results of the investigation, if any? I would appreciate any additional information you can provide on these cases.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM H. COLEMAN, JR.
