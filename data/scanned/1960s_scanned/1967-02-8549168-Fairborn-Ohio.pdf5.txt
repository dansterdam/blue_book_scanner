The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"PUBLIC FOR THE RECORD: 26 FEB 67
