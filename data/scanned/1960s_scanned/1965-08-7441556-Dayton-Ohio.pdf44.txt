Memo for the Record: 6 Aug 65

Call from Virginia Lovett (NICAP Member), 101 Marathon, Dayton, Ohio, she observed an unidentified object on 5 Aug 55. Sgt Moody said that from the description she was giving and at the time she saw it the object was apparently the satellite Pegasus I. She kept insisting that it couldn't be this and that she was going to report her sighting to NICAP. Sgt Moody said that was her privilege to report it to NICAP if she wanted to. She consented to fill out an AF FORM 164 that we would mail her.
