The image contains a Project Blue Book record card, which appears to be a form used to document sightings of UFOs or other aerial phenomena. The record card includes various fields to record details about the sighting, such as the date, location, type of observation, source, number of objects, and a description of the observed object. In this specific case, the record card indicates that the sighting occurred on 1 February 1960 in the Atlantic Ocean at coordinates 53-05N, 22-15W. The description states that the object was generally conforming to the pattern of a "missile" observation, and it is concluded that the object was likely a meteor.
