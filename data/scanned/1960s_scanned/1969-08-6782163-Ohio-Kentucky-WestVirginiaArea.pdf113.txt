There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system would:

DID THE PHENOMENA
STAN STILL AT ANYTIME? NO
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND THEN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLORS?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS?
FLARE OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
IS WHAT CAN YOU ADD ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENA?
A FLAT DISK OF LIGHT IN THE SKY

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
