8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
This object was first observed at about 15-50 high in the sky and started as an object that appeared to be to the north and proceeded to travel in a southerly direction. The object was described as shiny white and appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate at arm's length. It then developed a tail, then developed into a cluster of 4 or 5 bright white spot lights that were criss-crossing and travelling in a random fashion. These spot lights then developed into a ball that appeared to be about 20 to 30 feet in diameter with white lights on the exterior and smaller white lights moving about inside the ball. The object then faded from sight. Ended at about 10-15 above the horizon.
