10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Shiny white starlike objs w/red dot attached fm it. Looked a little earlier sighted objs which were determined to be balloons. Single reported was probably due to condensation formed when it burst. The light which is mut on balloons after sun set. Sun had set but due to height of balloon it was probably still in sunlight. Red light was probably the anti-collision light which is mut on balloons after sunset.
