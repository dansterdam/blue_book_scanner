MAN EMPTIES TWO ROUNDS OF BULLETS AT UFO
Albuquerque, New Mexico, April 29 - Shortly after midnight, Don Adams, 20-year-old Air Force Sergeant, was driving towards the Kirtland Air Force Base. Adams saw what he described as a large, luminous object hovering over the highway about a mile ahead. As the object approached, Adams stopped his car, reached in the backseat, and took out his .38 caliber service revolver. When the object was about 50 yards away, Adams fired two shots at it. The object, according to Adams, appeared to be "solid and black" and about 30 feet in diameter. Adams claimed that he could see a "window" or "port hole" on the object. The object then shot straight up, out of sight. Investigators pronounced Adams "sober."
