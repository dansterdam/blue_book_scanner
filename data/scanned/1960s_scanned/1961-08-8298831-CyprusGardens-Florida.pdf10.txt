UFO in 1961
On August 7, 1961 in Crestview, Florida, at 8:30 pm, two colored ladies and three teen-age colored boys saw a large round object with a bright orange light which circled, hovered and started descending. The object illuminated more intense as it came down closer to the ground. When it reached a certain height, it took off at a high rate of speed and was lost to sight in a matter of seconds.
