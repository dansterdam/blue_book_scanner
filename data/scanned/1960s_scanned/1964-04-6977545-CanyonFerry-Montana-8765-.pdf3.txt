CANYON FERRY, MONTANA
Sighting Report, April 6, 1964

At approximately 8:45 PM on 6 April 1964, Mr. and Mrs. James S. Musselmann of Helena, Montana, reported observing a strange object in the sky over the Canyon Ferry area near Helena, Montana.

The Musselmann's stated that they were driving along US Highway 12 approximately 7 miles west of Helena when they observed a bright light in the sky ahead of them. They said the object appeared to be at an altitude of about 2,000 feet and was moving in a southerly direction.

The object was described as round or oval in shape and appeared to be glowing with a yellow-white light. The Musselmanns said the object was silent and was not blinking or flashing. They stated it seemed to be under control and was not fluttering or wavering in its flight.

The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before it disappeared from view behind some trees. The Musselmanns were unable to determine the size of the object, but said it appeared to be larger than a standard aircraft. They reported no other unusual sightings or activity in the area.
