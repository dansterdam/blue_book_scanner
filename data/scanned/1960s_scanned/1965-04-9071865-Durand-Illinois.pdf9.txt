Dear Major Gaintanella:

There I am unable to find your request of March 5 which was filed with the Memo-1 file on March 15. I was unable to obtain a report since I have no such information.

You will note that I have filled in your requested form on the back of this letter. I am hoping that this information will be of interest to you and will meet your requirements.

Sincerely,
