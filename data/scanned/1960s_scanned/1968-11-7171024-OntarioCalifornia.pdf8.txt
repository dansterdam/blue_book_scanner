WHEN I FIRST SAW OBJECT-IT APPEARED
AS THE PLANET JUPITER-IT WAS STATIONARY AND THEN SEEMED TO ROTATE
AND START MOVING,QUITE FAST. I THEN SAW AIRCRAFT COME AROUND IT
AND AT IT-IT SEEMED TO OUTMANOEUVRE AIRCRAFT. IT APPEARED THE VERY
SAME FROM ALL ANGLES. IT CHANGED ALTITUDE TWICE QUITE SUDDENLY-
WENT RIGHT UP AND THEN CAME BACK TO FORMER POSITION.
