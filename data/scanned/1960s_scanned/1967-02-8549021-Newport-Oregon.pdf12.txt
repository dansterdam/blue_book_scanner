cataloged for 15 minutes. I still perceive the clock clearly until coming back into the house. Immediately preceding this dark unusual effect, the clock appeared to go back approximately 10 to 15 seconds. Animal on target lighting seemed to go out, but I turned it up my binoculars & holding I reed 11.50 pm?. From this and what occurred exactly coincided with 10 to 15 seconds delay on clock, it appears that something odd occurred on target. Needless to repeat , but I arrived at 10:57 and. I have read all the material on target in a normal sequence including detailed photographing any cue in the sky at night. Although I do not claim to be a professional astronomer, I have observed carefully many times and have observed "OFO's" last night appeared to me as a satellite like object, but slowly oscillated at various times and have a observed carefully their relative speeds, and the times and their movements, and I concluded that it was not a satellite. could not be visual confusion, as it was clear night with good observation conditions.
