1. Reference the attached copy of the report of an unidentified flying object sighting which occurred on Oradell, New Jersey on 15 Sep 62.

2. The witnesses reported the object to be approximate 50 feet in diameter and disc-shaped. It did not make any noise and passed overhead at 500 feet. The object was surrounded by a glow and had a mist-like appearance around it. Details of the object when first observed but were dull when the object disappeared.

3. As is assumed that the object was a bird, approximate 3 feet in diameter, the largest bird known would be the Andean Condor with a wingspan of approximately 10 feet. This bird is considerably smaller than the reported 50 feet in diameter.

4. No lightning activity was reported to have taken place during the sighting and the contributing factor.

5. If the witnesses will re-evaluate the case in the light of the foregoing information, it would be appreciated.
