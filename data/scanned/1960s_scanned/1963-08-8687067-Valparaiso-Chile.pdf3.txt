The circles which this subject was making represented a slight inclination and fluttering motion. It appeared to be gliding. If these ovals were interpreted in its two dimensions with the naked eye, they would appear to be spheres. This movement was completely and again disappearing in the air, the nearest to the observer and the farthest away seeming to be the same size, a factor of approximately 2 meters in diameter with an increased brilliance. It appeared between West and South and its trajectory was accompanied by a long luminous trail.

Commentsin regard to this sighting:"Apparently this was a very brilliant light which is puised by radio signal system interlining the ground station plus a picture at the time could not be obtained. The radio receivers on this equipment are similar to the ones used for some intelligence purpose. The light phenomena was of a very high intensity and it has been observed by MASA specialized in the astronomical site of Cerro Tololo over a period of 15 days. Being submitted to preclude the listing of a sighting report by another agency.
