8-20 August 29, 1964  A.F. 24:3 a.m.  I witnessed what appeared to be a large, brilliant, orange light in the western sky. It was located approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. The object remained stationary for approximately 5 minutes, then began to move slowly towards the northeast at a very slow speed. After traveling approximately 10 degrees, it began to accelerate rapidly and within several seconds had disappeared from sight. During the period it was visible, it emitted no sound and the light intensity remained constant.
