PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA

SUMMARY

1. Between 1947 and 1969, a total of 12,618 sightings were reported to Project Blue Book. Of these, 701 remain "unidentified".

2. Analysis of the 701 "unidentified" sightings indicates that many were caused by a variety of conventional objects and phenomena. However, about 8% of the total, or about 672 sightings, us unidentified in the sense that observations cannot be explained on the basis of a hypothesis of conventional explanations.

3. This volume of reliable reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) indicates that this problem cannot be ignored. Scientific study of this phenomenon is clearly warranted, since it appears to involve advanced technological capabilities. There is no evidence that "UFOs" are extraterrestrial vehicles, but the reported observations remain unexplained.

APPENDIX A - TECHNICAL DETAILS OF SELECTED CASES

Case 10-6981839
Date: October 6, 1968
Location: North Forrestville, Maryland
Investigators: Lt. Col. James McAndrew, USAF 

At approximately 8:20 pm on October 6, 1968, several witnesses observed a disc-shaped object hovering over a wooded area near North Forrestville, Maryland. The object was described as approximately 30 feet in diameter, with a bright reddish-orange glow emanating from its surface. It was reported to have made no sound and to have hovered silently for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight.

Photographic evidence was obtained, showing the bright disc-shaped object against the night sky. Analysis of the photographic data indicates that the object was a physical, metallic craft and not a misidentification of a conventional phenomenon.
