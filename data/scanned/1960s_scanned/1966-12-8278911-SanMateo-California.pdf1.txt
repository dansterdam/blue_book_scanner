11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched three brilliant lights in V formation travel slowly from horizon to horizon. The lights were brighter than the stars and between 2-3 degrees apart. The middle light disappeared as the other two lights continued westward together. A short time later, the two remaining lights turned off abruptly, leaving the area in darkness. The observer said the lights would not have been aircraft navigation lights as they were much brighter and the movement was unlike aircraft.
