AN ENCOUNTER Page 25.
So I answered that I truly had not been playing but I wanted to know who they were and where they came from. Then they said, "No son, I firmly decided that I wanted to brave a meeting and have the whole business done, no matter what." When I got to the fishing pond, a calm came upon me with young people. As so I drove to an isolated place I came across some railroad tracks. I parked and was walking down to get away from the road when I heard a pounding noise. The time was not midnight, it was rather early in the evening, and I R UN."
As I have written, I had turned to God for help and in Him was my safey and He promised. Therefore either the unknowns were "one too.', or I was about to "B Un" with something, something I did not really care to contemplate what it was. At the way I was not even from God. I decided not to stay there that night and went back home to search the Scriptures what was written there about other worlds, to see any clue she relationship of the unknowns to this world. Unhappily I did not find any satisfactory, although Christ's statement: "Other Sheep have I to be brought," may allude to the spoke of more than 1 race.
I also noted that He referred at another place tb his "angels" And I read the story of Christ's temptation. I really never had understood. Also, there came dispute I had had with my minister when in a study concerned the Apostle Paul and whether or not he knew of any other worlds. I had found a reference in Timothy that Paul would speak in Church nor held office and the explanations were not given.
