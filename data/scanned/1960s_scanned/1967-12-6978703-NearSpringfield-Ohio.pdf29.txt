The image does not contain any photographs. However, it does contain a handwritten description of the observed phenomenon, which states:

"Large half-sphere shape - bright orange color - sharp edges - small - much brighter than the moon would appear."

Acting as an OCR system, I have extracted all the text found in the document:
