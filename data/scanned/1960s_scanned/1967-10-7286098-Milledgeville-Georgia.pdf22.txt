The image contains no photograph, only text. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

Craig
Did it hurt your eyes to look at it?
It didn't hurt my eyes at all. It just reflected the sunlight a little bit.
Craig 
What did you do with the negatives when you took the pictures before that?
Well, I had them in my other hand. I figured that they were unusual in some way.
Craig
But you did have the negatives in your hand? You did keep them with you?
Well-born
While you are standing there, let's see if we can get it in with a longer exposure. There may be a little more detail than we can see under the conditions that we have got.
Craig
This picture is much like the first one or the second one you took. Maybe like the second one, I think.
Well-born
Positively-like to the tree trunk.
Craig
You can see in that picture the dead tree in the middle very nearly in contact. You can see the limbs and things that come out from the trunk. Just above that branch of the dead tree, second from the left, is the dead one shown in the natural position. This dead tree (Mr. -----'s) is in the picture, and he was standing 25 paces from where the photographer was located.
Well-born
Five fee beyond the tree.
Craig
Again, F-22, f-20 were 25 pases from the photographer. O.K. I guess that those pictures are quite unusual.
