The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 8 23 66
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your reaction.

I am enclosing a narrative which I hope covers the information you require. As you can see from the description, there was quite a brilliant light which appeared to move around in the sky and was observed by several people. The object also seemed to be giving off a steady glow and did not appear to have any wings or appendages. At one point it hovered over the highway and the witnesses believe they saw some type of opening or hatch on the underside of the object. The object then shot off at a very high rate of speed. The witnesses were quite shaken by the experience and felt that what they saw was some type of unidentified flying object. I hope this narrative provides the information you need. Please let me know if you require any additional details.
