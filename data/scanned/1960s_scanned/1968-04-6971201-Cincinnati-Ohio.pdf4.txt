This image does not contain any photographs, but rather consists of diagrams and illustrations. The image shows:

1. A compass rose illustration with directional labels (N, NW, W, etc.) and instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction of a phenomenon.

2. Two sketches or illustrations depicting a person in a landscape. The larger sketch shows a person standing in an open field or landscape, while the smaller sketch shows a person standing on a hilltop or elevated area looking out over a landscape.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

AFR 80-17(C1) 

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON AS IT WAS OBSERVED ON THE FIRST SIGHTING. PLACE A PCX" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON AS IT WAS OBSERVED ON THE SECOND SIGHTING.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "PECX" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN SEEN AGAIN. THE LARGER SKETCH, CURVES OR SIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
