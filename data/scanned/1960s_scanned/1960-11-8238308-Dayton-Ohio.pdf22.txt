In the following sketches, assume that you are at the points shown. Plan "A" shows the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

In the following lower sketch - at "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and "B" at its position later on, to show its change in position. Be careful to sketch as an example of how to report it.
