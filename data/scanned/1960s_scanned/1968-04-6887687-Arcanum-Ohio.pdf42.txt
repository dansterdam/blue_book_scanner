34. Can you describe the interior of the object(s) in any way?

35. Do you have any reason to believe the object(s) was occupied? If so, please explain.

36. What was the APPARENT size of the object(s) compared with the following familiar objects? (Note: The moon is to be used as a general reference point.) Please check the appropriate boxes.

THAN
smaller than a. faint star
smaller than b. bright star
smaller than c. object half as large as the moon
smaller than d. the moon
smaller than e. time at arm's length
smaller than f. nickel at arm's length
smaller than g. quarter at arm's length
smaller than h. half-dollar at arm's length
smaller than i. an orange at arm's length
other object at arm's length: PLEASE SPECIFY

37. What would you estimate the ACTUAL size of the object(s) to be (dimensions in feet along its greatest dimension)?

IX. MOVEMENT OF OBJECT(S)
38. In what direction was the object(s) traveling?

39. Describe the movement of the object(s), including the path (e.g., steady, wobbling, waving, etc.) and any changes in speed (e.g., rapid, slow, accelerating, decelerating).
