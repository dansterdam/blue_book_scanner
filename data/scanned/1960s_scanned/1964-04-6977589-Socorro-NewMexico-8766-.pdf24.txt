SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO 
DAtE: APRIL 24, 1964 
TIME: 5:45 P.M.
LOCATION: SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO, ABOUT TWO MILES SOUTHEAST OF SOCORRO
WITNESS(ES): PATROLMAN LONNIE ZAMORA
DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:
Patrolman Lonnie Zamora was driving south on N.M. Highway 1 at about 5:45 p.m. when he saw a shiny object in the sky at about a 45 degree angle. It appeared to be descending rapidly. He stopped his patrol car and observed the object land in a small arroyo about 1/2 mile south of the highway. Zamora said the object was white in color and about 20' long and 12' wide, and oval-shaped. He saw 2 people, apparently dressed in white coveralls, near the object. As he approached the area, the object rose rapidly and flew off to the southwest at a very high rate of speed. Zamora discovered a circular depression in the soil about 10" deep and 25' in diameter at the landing site, and several burn marks on the ground.
