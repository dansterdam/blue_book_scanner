The image contains a photograph, but it does not depict any human faces that I can identify. The photograph shows a man walking along a dirt path or road through a rural, forested landscape. The path appears to wind through the trees, and there is a dark silhouette in the distance that may be a building or other structure. The image has a dark, grainy quality, suggesting it is an older photograph.

BLACKTOP ROAD APPROACHING 
NAHA OKINAWA SIGHTING
10 AUGUST 1962 
WITNESS: S/SGT D. J. WILLIAMS, USAF
STATION: NAHA AIR FORCE BASE, OKINAWA

THE WITNESS STATED THAT WHILE HE WAS DRIVING ALONG A BLACKTOP ROAD APPROXIMATELY FIVE MILES FROM NAHA AIR FORCE BASE, HE OBSERVED A BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SKY WHICH HE AT FIRST THOUGHT WAS A STAR. HOWEVER, AS THE OBJECT DESCENDED, HE REALIZED IT WAS NOT A STAR BUT AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 1,000 YARDS IN THE AIR AND ABOUT 50-75 YARDS IN DIAMETER. IT HAD A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT AND A REDDISH-ORANGE GLOW AROUND THE PERIPHERY. THE OBJECT HOVERED FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.

THE WITNESS STATED THAT HE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO HIS BASE COMMANDER. THE BASE COMMANDER INSTRUCTED HIM TO SUBMIT A REPORT OF THE INCIDENT.
