OCR Text:

This object appeared to be
somewhat larger than a conventional aircraft and could be
seen at an altitude of approximately 500 ft. It made no sound
and was observed for approximately 15 minutes. The object
appeared to be metallic and reflected a brilliant light which
seemed to emanate from the entire surface. The object
maneuvered rapidly from side to side, then climbed at a sharp
angle and disappeared from sight.
