Subsequent to their observation they had received numerous telephone calls from others who either confirmed or heard the same or a similar object. These included children who observed the object. A local sheriff who saw the object confirmed its description from a distance.

The report states that a local doctor, who was contacted, said that the object appeared to be white and had a reddish tinge. It is also noted that Mrs. --- had a child a few months old but this did not disturb the sleeping child. Also, no lights were seen and it is assumed to a be a fire.

The report then describes an interview with Estaing R. Dunckhorst, who with Mr. and Mrs. ----- proceeded to the Delta Township Fire Barn Station at Grand Ledge, Michigan for an interview. The object was described as hovering over the yard and then ascending vertically at a high rate of speed. The object was in sight for only a few seconds and could not be seen after that. 

The report mentions that there was no estimation on the altitude of the object, and that it appeared to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. The noise and brightness caused concern that the object might become a hazard or cause a disturbance, but it passed without incident.
