The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text of the document is as follows:

EVIDENCE AND RECORDS
The records of reports and tapes of interviews are retained at Project Blue Book headquarters, together with copies of photographs and news clippings. Specific data on witnesses will be worked up on summary sheets, so that the content of this general report may be checked in detail if desired.

RECOMMENDATIONS
It was clear that the Suffolk County Air Force Base could not possibly conduct meaningful investigations of the UFO reports received there; an appreciation of the difficulties involved gave insight into what must be a problem at Air Force bases generally. The principal difficulties arise from lack of background knowledge and investigational experience on the part of personnel assigned to UFO duty, and the time and travel requirements involved in conducting full investigations. Most UFO reports are handled by telephone; they may come from anywhere within 100 miles of the base. The only sure way to get the information right, however, is to stand with the witness at the place of a sighting and tape the witness's own description; the inevitable consequence of failure to do this is generation of incomplete and even incorrect reports, and ultimate issuance of "explanations" that are indefensible. It would not seem likely on a statistical basis that many genuine UFO's would be missed (although some certainly have been missed), but it is a virtual certainty that investigations of unacceptable quality will lead to official statements which can only ultimately embarrass the Air Force.

pattern analysis studies in the future.
