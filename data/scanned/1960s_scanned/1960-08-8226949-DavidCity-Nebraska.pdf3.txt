The text describes a successful test of a "Ballute" (balloon-supported parachute) on a space capsule, indicating that it was tested by the Avco Corporation and could withstand altitudes of up to 225,000 feet.

"Ballute" Test Successful

Balloon To Be Used On Space Capsules

A balloon-supported fabric device, called a "Ballute", recently developed by the Avco Corporation, has successfully passed tests at the Avco Research and Advanced Development Division (ARDD) for Space capsules.

The Ballute is designed to retard the descent of a space capsule after it re-enters the earth's atmosphere. It works on the principle of a parachute, but is capable of withstanding pressures and temperatures far in excess of those which can be withstood by conventional parachutes.

In recent tests, the Ballute functioned satisfactorily at altitudes of over 225,000 feet - its zenith--and at a speed in excess of 14,000 feet per second, or over Mach 4. The successful test occurred at the Avco facilities in Wilmington, Mass.

The Ballute, which is packed within the space capsule, is deployed after the capsule has re-entered the earth's atmosphere. At that point, it rapidly inflates and establishes a stable subsonic descent.
