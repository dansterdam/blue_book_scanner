The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document.

As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

"We headed back toward Damon on Highway 36 and when we got to the area where the larger light had been, the smaller blue light again appeared out of the larger purple light. After the blue light moved exactly as it did the first time, it suddenly went out and we decided to leave the area because we figured that the object would start coming toward us.

We returned to West Columbia and told the City Judge of West Columbia, Jim McGee, and his assistant what we saw. Jim said this officially went over to the area and remained for about an hour and a half but they didn't see anything.

I returned to the area the following 2 nights at approximately the same time and have not seen anything like what we saw the first night. I have been unable to come up with any plausible explanation of what we saw that night. I have not been positive that the object was not any type of aircraft that I know to exist and I have not been able to see anything like it before.

I have been a Brazoria County Deputy Sheriff for 11 years and now occupy the position of Chief Deputy Sheriff. I, Leach, am 28 years old and have been with the Sheriff's Department for 6 years. Neither one of us had anything to drink on the night we saw the lights and the object. We were working the night shift.

The area where we saw the object is in Damon's area of responsibility and we were on patrol in that area at the time. The night was clear and there were no other lights in the area where we saw the object.
