UFO Observation April 7, 1967

Toledo, Ohio h.614

1. Reference your recent correspondence on your unidentified observation of April 7, 1967. Because of the date in receiving your report, we are unable to accomplish a thorough investigation on your sighting.

2. However, we did determine that a specially equipped B-26 was participating in maneuvers over Monroe County, Michigan from late April till July, 1967. This is a very slow moving craft that had two jet engines mounted under the wings and a white pulsating light (20,000 candlepower) mounted bbtl111 at its rear. The glow illuminated the entire fuselage. The aircraft covered a north-south course at a very high altitude, some of its strange lighting and extremely slow speed this aircraft seemed to have served as a training exercise. Most of the April sightings occurred at approximately 9:00 pm and had extremely long duration. Under analysis, we only have second hand information on this incident.

3. At this time it is impossible to determine if the craft was in the Toledo area on the night in question.
