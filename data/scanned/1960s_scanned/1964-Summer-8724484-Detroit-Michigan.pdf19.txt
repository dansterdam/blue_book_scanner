UFO HOVERS OVER MASSILLON, OHIO
Steady light-giving object which had been observed by various individuals in the Massillon, Ohio area for the past several evenings hovered for about 15 minutes over Massillon on July 19, 1964 at approximately 10:00 P.M. EDT. The object seemed to be about 200 feet in diameter and was illuminated with a bright steady light. It suddenly increased in brilliancy and sent several beams of light straight down to the ground. This action was repeated several times. After about 15 minutes the object moved rapidly and silently to the Northeast and disappeared from sight.

Police and other observers in the area stated that the object definitely was not an aircraft, helicopter or any known type of man-made object. They described it as a very bright, steady light, much larger than a star and giving the appearance of being very close to the ground. No sound was reported.
