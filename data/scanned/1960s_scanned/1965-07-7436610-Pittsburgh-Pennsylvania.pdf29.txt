THE flying saucer-shaped object climbed rapidly to an altitude of about 30,000 feet, moved over widely separated parts of the ground in a matter of seconds, then hovered motionless for several minutes before speeding out of sight, reports Walter Webb, of the Charles Hayden Planetarium.

This followed sightings of white objects in the last two years by American Airlines crews and others near Ardmore, Okla. Planes took photographs of one object and revealed that it was 300 to 400 feet in diameter and at a height of about 40,000 feet.

Mr. Webb said the latest sighting was by several civil defense observers and sheriff's deputies at Ardmore last Tuesday evening. 

The observers, he said, watched the saucer-shaped object for about 20 minutes as it performed various maneuvers high in the sky. Allen Hynek, scientific consultant to the Air Force, verified the report.
