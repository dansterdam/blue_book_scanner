The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain a photograph, but rather a written interview transcript.

INTERVIEW WITH MR. & MRS.
(The los sample shown in the accompanying photographs belonged to the witnesses. They related the following information to me during the photographic session in their front yard.)
The sample was taken from the frozen pond at about 5:00 pm on Sunday, February 18.
did not report any unusual disturbances on the night of the sighting near their home, but they did say that a similar light had been seen by their daughter and her boyfriend (the gravel pit is a local lovers' lane) about four or five years back.
Mr.  stated that he had seen some UFOs in 1953. Briefly, the sighting occurred on a clear, hot day during the summer in Seattle. He reports seeing twelve disks ("like pink balloons") in the northern sky. The disks were "playing" (circling around each other) as they crossed to the south. One disk was reported to have left the group at a very high speed.
INTERVIEWER'S COMMENT
Both of these people were very anxious to cooperate with me. They agreed to keep the sample of ice for a month before getting rid of it. It is therefore available if needed for further investigation.
