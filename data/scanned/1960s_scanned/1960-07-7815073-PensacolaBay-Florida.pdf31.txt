Was so dark the light shone from the object & her shadow was visible on the ground below. That object appeared to be oval or circular in shape and emitted a steady bright light. It seemed to hover or move very slowly. It did not make any noise. Mrs. Donnell & son saw the object for about 15 minutes. By the time her husband came it had disappeared. Mrs. Donnell says that her son called her attention to the object & that she saw it for about 15 minutes before it disappeared. She describes it as a bright light or luminous object which hovered or moved slowly without any noise. The light from the object was bright enough to cast a shadow on the ground.
