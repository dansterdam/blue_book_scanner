Reference your letter, Supplemental Information on UFO Report, TXR DO-161-20 30302, 30 Apr 64, Luke AFB, Arizona. The film was developed and printed by Photo Center, Griffiss AFB, New York. The original slides, however, came from Arizona, owner: thanking him on behalf of the Air Force for their use. We did not find any pictures which would be useful in identifying the reported UFO. In fact the slides are blank. However, the sighting and the object/objects described by the witness are well documented on a low level flight. The usual things that might be about the aircraft was its use of a strobe instead of the conventional lights and/or flares. We are returning the photos which were processed and returned to us by the Kodak Company.
