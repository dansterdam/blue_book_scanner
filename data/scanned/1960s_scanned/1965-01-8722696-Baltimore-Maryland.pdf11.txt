To whom it may concern:
The saucer at which my eyes first could distinguish was about 50 to 60 ft in diameter and had a color of a dull or grey. This flying object appeared on a clear night, just after sundown, about 6.30 p. m. It came into view about 10Â° above the horizon, traveling at a phenomenal speed of at least 800 miles per hour and did not make any sound. This object had a strange luminescent glow and was not transparent but translated a brilliant light. As this object came into view it suddenly stopped, then executed a downward curve toward the ground, approximately 75 yards distant. Then it turned and slowly climbed up to a considerable height where it just disappeared from view. This all happened in a matter of a few minutes and was witnessed by two other reliable persons who gave the same account as mine.
