The image does not contain any photographs, only text. I will now produce the output of the text found in the document:

THIS IS TO CERTIFY that we, the undersigned, individually and jointly saw an object in the sky on the night of June 11, 1965, between the hours of 9 and 11 p.m. while driving westbound on highway 80 near Bryte, California.

This object was flying at a very high rate of speed, and on no more than three occasions it appeared to stop momentarily, then again it accelerated to a very high rate of speed. Then again, approximately ten minutes later, the object blinked on and off for a period of approximately fifteen minutes. When suddenly it appeared to increase in size, then it disappeared from our view. This object appeared to be very bright object, greenish in color.
