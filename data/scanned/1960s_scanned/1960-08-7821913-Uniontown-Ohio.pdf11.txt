Dear Sir,
The report of sighting is submitted herewith. On Tuesday, August 2, 1960 at 3:45 P.M., the witness, who will remain anonymous, observed an object in the sky near Uniontown, Ohio.
The object was described as being about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, spherical in shape, and a metallic color. It appeared to be in a stationary position at an estimated altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The witness observed the object for about 5 minutes and stated that it suddenly disappeared. No sound was heard.
The witness, who has been questioned thoroughly, appears to be a reliable person. There were no other witnesses to this sighting.
Additional information is requested if you desire any further details.
Sincerely yours,
