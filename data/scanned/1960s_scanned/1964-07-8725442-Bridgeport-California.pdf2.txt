"R.A.S.C.
Atascadero, Calif.
D.G.I.

July 12, 1964

We have recently returned from a camping trip into the High Sierra at Bridgeport, California, which contained a rather unusual incident.

We were able to clearly observe for some 50 minutes, starting at 9:15 P.M., a luminous object hovering over a wooded area. It was disc-shaped, brilliant white in color, and approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter. It was noted by the entire family and remained quite stationary until a fairly fast dash into the distance and out of sight was made. It was about 15 degrees above the horizon and at an estimated distance of 3 to 4 miles away. The object emitted no sound and left no trail.

Our children, ages 8, 10 and 12, are quite anxious to know what they saw. We hope you can help us identify this unusual sight.

Sincerely,
(Signature)
Atascadero, Calif."
