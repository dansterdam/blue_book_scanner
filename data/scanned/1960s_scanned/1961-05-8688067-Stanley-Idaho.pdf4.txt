We were on a reconnaissance trip Custer Creek to locate a likely spot of light and dark. The day was partly cloudy, windy. We stopped to just and inspect a bridge over a small creek. To the north and east to the east we saw the objects all colored at first white, then dark, then white. We saw the objects or apparitions all around on the horizon. The objects compressed sideways estimated about 50 meters appear to move up and down. They appear to hold a rigid shape while performing erratic maneuvers, oscillating, disappearing and reappearing where we had estimated they had been. The objects made no sound. They appeared to be at varying distances and elevations from us. We observed the objects for about an hour and a half to 2 hours time. The objects finally disappeared to the east.
