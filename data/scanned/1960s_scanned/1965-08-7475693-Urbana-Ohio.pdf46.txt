The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, which includes diagrams and instructions related to reporting and tracking unidentified flying objects.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that "A" is the object you saw. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where the horizon was (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the same curved line to show where you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end, and show any changes in direction during the course.

A thought he almost unimportant to know what the exact object or went in the sky course, because it would probably be a ominous anomaly

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Less than one thought.
