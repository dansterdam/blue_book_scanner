There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

Proposed reply to letter from [information redacted] dated May 24, 1957 (sighting 6 June 57)

Reference your recent letter in which you requested information on an unidentified flying object. With the information which you submitted in your letter, it would be extremely difficult to offer an explanation on your observation. Essential data such as size, characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation.

Also, it is not possible for us to undertake an investigation into the cause or your observation, since your sighting occurred outside the limits of the United States.

The enclosed information on the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects should be of interest to you. Thank you for bringing your observation to our attention. We hope that your visit to the United States is pleasant.
