STATEMENT

I, student, University of Illinois.
"I was returning home from the auditorium after attending the movie. I observed a bright light, quite similar to a 1949 aircraft, coming towards me from the north east and was visible for 10 minutes. The time was from 2:10 to 2:20 hours on the 25th of February."
