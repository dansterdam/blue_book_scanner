The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains two sketches or illustrations. The first is a sketch showing the position and angles of an observed object in the sky, with a compass rose to indicate the direction. The second sketch shows the motion path of an observed object or objects, with an arrow indicating the direction of movement.

Text Transcription:
27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you last saw the object.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
