Text of the document:

Mr. -- is obviously intelligent, scientifically quite competent as an observer. Since he is emphatic on the fact that he is well acquainted with high-flying jets and that they "seem" are faced with more of a problem than if he could see an aircraft. 

Concerning the other sightings: The first sighting was on Thursday, August 15th. The passage was apparently very similar to the one of August 13th except that there was no moon. The time was 11:30 P.M., night giving time. The sighting of August 11th was not so in the day. It was observed as about 250' elevation above the western horizon, having come into sight directly in the south proceeding in a northwesterly direction. With the sighting of the low elevation, this could very well have been an aircraft away to be heard. It is harder to apply this interpretation which were seen directly overhead.

If we adopt the "per apparent angle of reference" our tables shows that a craft at 10,000 feet would have an apparent angular elevation of about 250 miles per hour, or at 5 miles, 625 miles per hour. Because of the rapidity of flight, this would appear something like a jet with its sudden acceleration. I would never contend that the sightings were per se a proof of the existence of interplanetary vehicles, but it seems the most logical explanation. A jet would have not have to be heard, and the brilliance of the light argues against where is the possibility of a sustained retrograde maneuver, there is the unidentified category. Because it appeared on two occasions as a one-witness matter, and the motion is that of an aircraft, a would tend to classify the last of at least this down as possible aircraft. Don't tell this to Mr. -- as he would stoutly argue against this.
