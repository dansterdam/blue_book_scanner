We also discussed a bright light in the sky which I had seen while driving my car on 6 September 1964. I estimated my speed at the time to be about 65 mph and the light was directly in front of my car, apparently hovering. The light source appeared to be about the size of Jupiter and was very bright and brilliant. The entire sighting lasted about 15 seconds. The light did not appear to move, only pulsate slightly in brightness. I was not able to positively identify the light as a planet, however, and since I could not physically examine it up close, I remained unconvinced that it was a natural phenomenon. Therefore, I recommend that my report of 3 September 1964, the above, be investigated further by proper authorities.
