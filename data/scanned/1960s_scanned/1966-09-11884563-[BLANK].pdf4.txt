The provided image appears to contain a handwritten letter addressed to the "Attention: Commanding Officer" from someone named William J. Dunn. The letter discusses a report of an unidentified flying object that was made on or about December 27, 1949. It mentions that the report was made available to the press, and that the sender is now engaged in a "quite thorough thesis" concerning the sightings of unidentified objects. The letter expresses the sender's difficulty in obtaining a copy of the previous report and requests assistance in this matter. The letter is signed by William J. Dunn at the end.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Lt. William J. Dunn
3306 E. Red es Ave.,
Fresno, Calif. 93703
Attention: Commanding Officer

Dear Sir:

On or about December 27, 1949, the Air Force made a report dealing exclusively with unidentified flying objects. The report was titled "Project Grudge" and was later released under the name "Project Blue Book". A copy of this report was made available to all the press media in Fresno, Calif. as a result of my request.

I am now engaged in a quite thorough thesis as to the sightings of unidentified objects. As you can well imagine, I find it impossible for me to obtain a copy of the various news sources to which the report was presented. Therefore, it can not be utilized for any possible read and evaluation of the material.

Since the report seems to be of an extremely confidential nature, I would appreciate if you could give me some assistance at this time. If you are extremely busy and my letter will be processed for your attention, I would appreciate for you to answer this in any way possible. Thank you for your time and trouble.

Respectfully,
William J. Dunn
