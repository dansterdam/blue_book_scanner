The image does not contain any photographs, only a hand-drawn sketch. The sketch shows a rough outline of an unidentified object, with the observer's notes describing its appearance and motion.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Completely silent.
b. Color - Grayish red.

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, propulsion, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

a. Fuzzy or blurred
b. Like a bright star
c. Sharply outlined
