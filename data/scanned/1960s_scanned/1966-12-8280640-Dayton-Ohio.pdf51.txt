Dear Major Hathaway, Unverified:

I am a student of ufology and have been interested in this subject for many years, though I admit I am not the most knowledgeable individual when it comes to the details of the field. However, I have observed a good deal and have come to certain conclusions.

I firmly believe that we are dealing with an extraterrestrial phenomenon, the nature of which is not fully understood. While there are certainly many hoaxes and misidentifications, I am convinced that legitimate cases of UFO sightings and encounters exist. These cases, properly investigated, could provide invaluable insights into the nature of the phenomena.

I would be most grateful if you could provide me with any information or guidance that might assist me in furthering my own understanding of this topic. Any advice or suggestions would be deeply appreciated.

Sincerely yours,
