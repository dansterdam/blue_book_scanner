PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 66-23
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
DATE: January 1966
PHOTOGRAPHY: 1 print, 1 negative
QUALITY: GOOD
PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 66-96 from Major R. Quintanilla, SAFOV/USO, who asked for an analysis of a negative and print depicting an Unidentified Flying Object.
ANALYSIS: This analysis was completed jointly by the Photo Analysis and Photo Processing Section. There is no indication on the negative or print that the object photographed was in any way connected with experimental aircraft of the U.S. Air Force. The image could have been caused by a reflected light from a small water droplet on the lens. A minor drawing on the film's surface shows no evidence of deliberate attempt to hoax or falsify the photograph. A visual analysis shows no indication of unnatural or unidentified object.
