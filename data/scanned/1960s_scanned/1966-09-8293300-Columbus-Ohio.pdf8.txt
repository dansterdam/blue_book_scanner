Text extracted from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object did not disappear completely. It just slowly faded away.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - The object made no sound, as if there was a dead silence.
b. Color - The object seemed to be illuminated, with a whitish glow.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object you saw, such as wings, portholes, etc., and especially show the direction the object was moving.

[The drawing shows an elongated, cigar-shaped object with a rounded top.]
These weird little lines going out from it might indicate some kind of illumination or luminosity.
