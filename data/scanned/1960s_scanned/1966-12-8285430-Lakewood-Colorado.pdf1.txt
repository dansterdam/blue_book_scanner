The report describes the observation of a balloon-like object that was slowly moving towards the western sky. There was no apparent motion of the object other than a slight change in shape. The observer noted numerous aircraft in the area west of Denver, however rules out any aircraft observation, as the object was under constant observation. The investigation is consistent with that of a balloon observation.
