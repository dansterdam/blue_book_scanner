Transcribed text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown by the "x". Show how high the object was above the horizon (altitude) when you first saw it. Please draw an arrow to show the direction the object was moving when you first saw it. Please a "B" on the diagram where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the earth, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
