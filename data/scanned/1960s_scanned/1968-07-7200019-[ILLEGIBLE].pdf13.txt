Solar Flare Sparks 
Lights, Jams Radio
Large flaring solar storm accompanied by magnetic storms and auroral displays late last night and today. Authorities on the sun's activity believe a major flare erupted from the sun's surface beginning at 10:30 pm GMT July 7. This flare, one of the biggest of the current 11-year cycle, produced brilliant displays of the northern lights in Alaska, Canada, and western states. Radio signals in the higher frequencies were seriously jammed or blacked out over a wide area.
