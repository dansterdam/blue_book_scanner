TEST/UFO(M-3 H Quintanilla, Jr/70315/MS/16May) 17 May 1967

UFO Specimen, 30 March 1967

3902nd Air Base Wing
Attn: BCJ/Lt Sisk

1. Reference your recent letter regarding the physical specimen found 30 March 1967 by I Lt J H Sisk (30-310). The fused mass in the center was glassy or crystalline in nature. The exterior showed the material to be inorganic and impure formation. The outside was irregular in shape and contained many air bubbles. It appears the sample was formed by a rapid solidification process.

2. It appears the samples received from the contact of a high voltage wire and sand; however, your letter indicated this was not the case.

3. Request you inform me if any further analysis of our findings. There is no indication the specimen were of extraterrestrial origin.
