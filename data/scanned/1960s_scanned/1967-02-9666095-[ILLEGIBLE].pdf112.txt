AN ENCOUNTER
Page 28.

I did not go out again that night but after I had come into the house started bumping and shaking as if my girl was doing a wild watusi. As the disturbance continued I could see the drapes moving and I started to them to stop the noise, making no noise! The younger was already in bed and already was fixing her hair in the bathroom and neither had been out.

I could only guess that we had some manner of rate. I went back to bed and was nearly asleep when the disturbance started on my mattress. I really didn't feel like continuing this argument with the force and suddenly I heard, 3-x's and I came fully awake to the rest which went like this: "Jesus is Savior -- We know -- He has shown His sheep -- I am but a Savior -- Savior is in His heaven." Will you can/mm tress and anguish? I have never considered myself to be a sample of Christian and in times past the lusts of the flesh and once had been on the verge of a habitual smoker, have sworn like a stevedore and with myself as a witness I can testify that I have a niche in the farthest corner of Heaven and truly Christ was what He said He was - the Son of God and gives us coming to be as pure and a message of clay - when - such a message to me? Incredible and completely astounding!

Finally went back to bed after pacing my room for half an hour, my trusty little 38 put the whole business out of my thought. Saturday, September 8, I was busy getting other had no time to think more about the matter until after 24 hours. There was to be a funeral at our village church and I debated whether or not to go first because I was not impressed by the strange happening the night before.
