INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT, BUT WHICH IS NOT ACCURATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

Aircraft passing over Iowa City at 10:40 PM, Commanding officer, first thought an experimental aircraft from the ground. But this did not appear normal due to the speed and low altitude over the city and the fact that the aircraft did not have any running lights nor did it appear to be an aircraft that was leaving or heading to the municipal airport in Iowa City. The aircraft was about 200 to 300 feet over the roof tops and was moving at a very high rate of speed, silent, and seemed to have a glow around the entire craft. The duration of the sighting was about 30 seconds to 1 minute. There was no opportunity to get a good description of the craft, only seeing it as it passed over. I suspect that it was a type of aircraft that we have not yet developed, or some type of aircraft that has not been made public. It did not appear to be any type of conventional aircraft that I am familiar with. The speed, altitude, and lack of lights and sound make me question what this could have been. I am quite sure that this was not an experimental aircraft from the municipal airport or any other source. The aircraft seemed to defy the laws of aviation that I am familiar with.
