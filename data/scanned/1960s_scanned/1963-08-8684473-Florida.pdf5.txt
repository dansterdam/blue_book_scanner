November 20, 1963

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

The sighting of August 8, 1963 which you reported to the Air Force has been studied by the Sundogs or moon dogs are familiar phenomena to Dr. Donald H. Menzel, in his book "The World of Flying Saucers," describes Sundogs as follows:

"Sundogs are another special effect resulting from the unusual conditions of refraction and reflection of sunlight in ice crystals floating in a layer or cirrus clouds. These tiny ice crystals, floating in a layer of cirrus clouds, are responsible for many strange phenomena in the sky, such as haloes, mock suns, and sundogs. Such crystals may be invisible to the observers, and while the halo phenomenon is visible, the sundogs that accompany the moon are often mistaken for another object. These images are called mock suns and, like the mock suns that accompany the moon, they appear in the sky aft bright and colorful and are often mistaken for the real thing. They appear to the side of the sun or the moon and have a brilliance resembling that of the celestial body they accompany."

Thank you for reporting this unusual aerial phenomena to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
MASTON M. JACKS
