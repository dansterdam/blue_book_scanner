CONCLUSIONS

After considering the available information it was concluded that some type of unusual upper atmospheric phenomena had occurred. Contact was made with NASA in regards to any type of upper atmospheric research project that was currently underway at Fort Churchill in Manitoba, Canada.

It was learned that on 16 August 1966, German and American scientists were participating in several experiments over the Fort Churchill area. At 2239 GMT there was a rocket that departed the Fort Churchill launch area and reached an altitude of approximately 250 miles. Shortly before reaching the altitude, there was a barium cloud release into the atmosphere. The artificial cloud first appeared with a brilliant red color followed by and ending with a greenish-blue.

Primary objective of the experiment was to obtain measurements of electric fields and wind motion in the upper atmosphere by photographing and tracking the movement of the ionized barium clouds. The phenomena was visible for several hours and for hundreds of miles depending on the altitude of the sighting.

It is Project Blue Book's conclusion, after a careful evaluation of the available data, that this barium cloud release was the cause of the sightings. As the cloud was expanding it would have definitely seemed as if it were approaching the observer at a tremendous rate of speed. Being about 600 miles to the north from the one aircraft sighting, it would have appeared to pass the aircraft as the pilot so stated; this is a natural feeling when something is quite distant and visible to the naked eye.
