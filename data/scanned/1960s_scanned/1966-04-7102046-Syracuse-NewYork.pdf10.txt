Dear M--:

Reference your recent unidentified observation. The information in your letter of 7 April 1966 was not sufficient for evaluation. It is requested you provide your detailed UFD Form 164 evaluation to assist us in classifying the reported observation.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
