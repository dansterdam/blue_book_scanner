Dear Major, Gentlemen,

just read your letter Aug 23 in regards to the sighting they had on Aug 5. I am getting many letters from persons telling me strange sightings of some kind. As you know I sent you a copy of my photo and letter Capt C. R wrote me each and said that they were going to make a negative from the mayor the smallest mention of it and that I could receive in the near future.

This document appears to be a letter from a witness describing a UFO sighting and their correspondence with the Project Blue Book team. The text is handwritten and discusses the witness's account of the sighting, as well as their interactions with the project investigators.
