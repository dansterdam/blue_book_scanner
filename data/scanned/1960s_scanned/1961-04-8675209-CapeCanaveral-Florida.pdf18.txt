PAGE FIVE XXXXPT 90X G
CONFIRMED 2 OF THE 3 UNKNOWN TARGETS, AND DURING 6 LAUNCHES AFTER
27 APRIL NO UNIDENTIFIED RADAR TARGETS WERE DETECTED WITH NO CHANGE
IN OPERATIONAL RADAR SETTINGS. THEORY IS STILL CONCLUDED AS UNAUTHORIZED
AIRCRAFT. THE THEORY THAT FOREIGN OR UNAUTHORIZED AIRCRAFT WERE
PRESENT ON THE RANGES IS STILL CONCLUDED TO BE PROBABLE. DURING
19 APRIL POLARIS TEST IN 1962 THE FPS-16 AND FPS-24 RADAR PICKED UP ECHT
UNPLOTTABLE ECHOS WITH ATTITUDES AT EXTREMES. THE FPS-24 PICKED UP
TARGETS. THE FPS-24 WEIGHT FINDER RECORDED UNPLOTTABLE ECHOES AT
20-22, AND THE SIGNAL ACQUISITION PILOT EMPHATICALLY STATES THAT HIS
MACHINE RADAR LOCKED ON A TARGET WHICH WAS LATER LOST. THIS BACKGROUND
CIRCUMSTANCE WAS INVESTIGATED AS PROBABLY DUE TO ATMOSPHERIC PATCH
WHICH SOMETIMES RECEIVES A LIVE AIRCRAFT RETURN.
DURING THE JUNO LAUNCH TEST ON 27 APRIL THE UA-25 AIRCRAFT WAS
OBSERVED. THE FPS-16 AND FPS-24 RADAR CONFIRMED THE TRACK OF THIS
UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT DURING THE POLARIS ACEX SITE AS AN UNKNOWN
TRACK ON G.C.I. THE HEIGHT FINDER FPS-26 DID NOT DETECT THIS UNKNOWN
TARGET. PART EIGHT. CONCLUSION OF THE COMMANDER, PATRICK ACAU
