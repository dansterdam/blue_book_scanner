Dear Mr. -
Reference is made to your letter of January 27, 1965, requesting information on a film in our possession noticing a UFO sighting on 18 June 1964 near El Paso, Texas.

This report was investigated by personnel from Biggs AFB, Texas. Information obtained by the investigating officer indicated that no film of the reported sighting was available.

The case was analyzed and the report submitted with the findings, however, as the officer stated, no film was available either from the individuals concerned or from any other source.
