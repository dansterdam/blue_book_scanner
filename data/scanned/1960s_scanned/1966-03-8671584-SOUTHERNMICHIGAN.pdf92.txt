UFO's Again Reported Over Michigan Area
ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) - Several persons, including police officers, reported seeing unidentified flying objects moving through the air over southern Michigan.
Three times in a week residents of the nearby communities reported sighting unidentified flying objects floating through the night air.
The latest sightings were made by more than a score of persons.
Patrolman Robert Davenport and his wife, Leona, saw the objects zoom down to lower altitude and then zip away at a terrific speed. When it was joined by a similar object, Davenport said he was convinced "they were real."
Maynor said he was observing when he noticed flashing lights through a window.
Officer James Jones and his wife, Roberta, 23, and his sister-in-law, Penny, Leoni, also saw the objects.
Fitzpatrick tried to reach the objects by following up in his car and found that it flew away as he approached.
Police Chief Robert Taylor, who was accompanied by Patrolman A. G. Lenz, said their search by car and with binoculars failed to find anything.
The officers could find nothing unusual in the swamp there wasn't anything there.
The objects are not new to Michigan, especially in Wayne County, where many people have reported seeing them in past years.
Previous sightings were made in the Ypsilanti area last summer, police said. One pilot in the area reported trailing a strange object when it suddenly zoomed out of sight.
An air traffic controller at Willow Run Airport reported an unknown object on his radar screen moving at speeds estimated between 500 and 600 mph.
