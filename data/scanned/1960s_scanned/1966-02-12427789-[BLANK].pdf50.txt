The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing types of UFO identifications and evaluations.

Identified reports are those for which sufficient specific information has been accumulated and evaluated to permit a positive identification or classification of the object.

Reports categorized as Insufficient Data are those for which one or more elements of information necessary for evaluation are missing. Some examples are the omission of the duration of the sighting or disappearance. If an element is missing and there is an indication that the sighting may be of a security, scientific, technical, or military nature, the Project Blue Book Office conducts an additional investigation and every attempt is made to obtain the information necessary for identification. However, in some instances, essential information cannot be obtained, and no further action can be taken.

The third and by far the smallest group of evaluations is categorized as Unidentified. A sighting is considered unidentified when a report apparently contains all pertinent data necessary to succeed a valid hypothesis concerning the cause or explanation of the report but the description of the object or its motion cannot be correlated with any known object or phenomenon.

The text then goes on to discuss other aspects of UFO identifications and evaluations, including satellites, aircraft, and the work of the Project Blue Book Office.
