Dear Mr. Gallen,

On March 29, March 16, and received information. This was over the three times on the morning of between 1:30 AM and 2:30 or 3:00. The first time it was for a man in sight for only a second and that's it. The second time he saw it for about 30 seconds. The third time he saw it in front of him about 50 the ground. It crossed in front of him (he was in his car) moving at a river. When it got to the other side it took off with a terrific burst of speed. He stated that he did see any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.
