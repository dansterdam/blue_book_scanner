EXTRACTED TEXT:

It is order that the public be provided with an information on reports of unidentified flying objects and that the general public be brought up to date on the investigations being carried out on the subject. Since 1952, 10% of the 1,231 reports of unidentified flying objects have been unsolved and unresolved. This figure has remained constant over the past several years.

Many foreign reports have been scrutinized to determine whether they differ significantly from those originating in the U.S. either as to physical characteristics or manner of observation. The Air Force has no knowledge of a single document by ATIC which states that a sighting could not possibly have a reasonable explanation. One of the reasons documents establishing the projects stated that no sighting would be listed as "unknown" unless it could not possibly have a reasonable explanation is the desire to avoid the public misconception that every unexplained report is conclusive evidence of interplanetary vehicles. To give the true public the impression that the reports are utterly mysterious constitutes misrepresentation of the known facts.

Unidentified aerial objects in themselves are not important intelligence targets. Unusual sightings being observed by trained observers are important and deserve thorough investigation. However, this does not imply that those which remain unexplained are necessarily extraterrestrial vehicles as some have speculated. The objects are interpianetary space ships.
