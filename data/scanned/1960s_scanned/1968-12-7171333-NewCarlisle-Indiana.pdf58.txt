The image does not contain any photographs. However, it shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text on the document is as follows:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STILL AT ALTITUDE?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN FLIGHT AND EXPLODE?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
MAKE A NOISE?

A bright flashing light went outside to investigate.

WHAT HAPPENED? It vanished abruptly due to obscured vision.

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING, AT ANY TIME?
