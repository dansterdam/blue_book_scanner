theories--which I file in my file called novel ideas to avoid the possible libel implications or crackpot--have taught me how a typical fraud or crackpot chooses his words and phrases. Among other things, he cannot conduct a rational discussion, but resorts to constant repetition; he won't listen to the other person and cannot answer questions rationally or intelligently. 

I have never, however, attended a saucerian convention.  
The Sixth Interplanetary Spacecraft Convention was held in Yucca Valley, California, on last May 31 and June 1, with 10,000 in attendance. It was here that one newsman was wandering, bewildered, trying to find someone sane to talk to, and entered into conversation with one young woman who appeared to have sense; and so he discussed with her his interest in Mars, pointing out that he had a small telescope and often observed Mars.  The young lady listened intently, making an intelligent comment occasionally, but the budding friendhship ended most abruptly when she said, "How interesting--and when did you last visit Mars?"

At another convention, a saucer enthusiast distributed packets of hair clipped from a 385-pound Venusian dog.  It's things like this that give saucers a bad name!!  Scarce wonder that the whole subject--which undoubtedly has some scientific paydrirt in it--is so easily tossed aside by responsible people. And, oh yes, at another convention one could buy a book.
