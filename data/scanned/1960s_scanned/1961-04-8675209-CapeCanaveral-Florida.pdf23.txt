Mrs. Anita Corley

Dear Mrs. Corley:
This is in reply to your letter of February 27, 1961 concerning the unidentified flying object observed by your husband on February 20, 1961 at Cape Canaveral, Florida.
I am sorry that I cannot give you any more information regarding this incident than you already have. As you know, the Air Force thoroughly investigates all reports of unidentified flying objects, but in many cases an adequate explanation cannot be determined from the available evidence.
In this case, it appears that the object was seen only for a short period of time and no photographs were obtained. Without further details or corroborating information, there is little we can add to the report you have already made.
I regret that I cannot be of more assistance in this matter. If any additional information becomes available, I will be sure to let you know.
Sincerely yours,
FPC
