Resistencia

The three-man crew of a freight train had a strange experience between Presidente Madariaga and Resistencia, Province of El Chaco, according to the report (date not given), they beheld, walking along the railway track towards them, a tall being, "over 2 metres" in height, wearing a red one-piece garment. The driver slowed down, and all three were able to see this strange being, who, they assert, had a pale face, and was holding something before it. They thought at first that the object looked like the body of a small child. Suddenly, when the locomotive was not more than 5 metres away, the being disappeared "like a whirlwind, and vanished". Railway officials subsequently searched the area but found nothing. Meanwhile, in the town of Resistencia, a man named Justo Nasán reported to the authorities that on the same day, and at about the same hour, just as he and his ten-year-old daughter were about to take their supper in the garden, "a strange being descended towards them". In an interview with journalists, Nasán established that the figure was identical in all respects with the apparition seen by the train crew.
