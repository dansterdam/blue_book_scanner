There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

The text, as interpreted by an OCR system, is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: Jul 11 1964 Day Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

During the month of June or July, the 26 to 30 years old couple reported a sighting of an unidentified object which they observed for some 10 to 15 minutes - hovering at a considerable altitude. They became greatly frightened and terminated the observations - leaving the scene hurriedly. Both were highly impressed with the performance of the object and its movements. It appeared to be very rapid in pace and made some quick maneuvers. It was most unusual and spectacular. They could not account for it. They were baffled and greatly upset by the experience. I may have additional details in my records which I will check and report later if pertinent.
