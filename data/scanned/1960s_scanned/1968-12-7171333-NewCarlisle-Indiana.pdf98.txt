Area Code 217. I am home around 6:30 PM. Wife came home & 10 year old daughter. We were watching TV & my daughter screamin & screamin as the yard light went out. She pointed & said "There is that big orange light or something. I looked out & saw a bright orange light, it moved slow & high, no noise, just passed over the trees & went out of sight. 
It seemed bigger than any star or planet. It moved slow, very bright & seemed to be rounded or cigar shaped. The light wasn't flashing or anything. Seemed to just pass on by. Couldn't see the outline of anything, just the bright orange light. 
My daughter was very excited & upset as we watched it. I couldn't understand what the heck it was. It seemed to just float or glide by very slowly.
I hope my call has some value. I do wonder if there any others in this area that saw the same thing.
