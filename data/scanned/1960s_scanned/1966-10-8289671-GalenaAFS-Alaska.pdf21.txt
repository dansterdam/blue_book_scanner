Seeing as how this object can gyrate Up and Down, back and forth, sideways-in a split second - it was Fascinating - Lights on and sudden No lights, and yet it could be plainly seen Grayish form in the sky, about 1100 ft. above me, seemed to follow the Buffalo Rd. - about 6-8 car lengths ahead of me - all the way into Rochester - when I turned left into - it did likewise .- it turned Right on , so did it. It followed me until I reached my home when again the lights on either end appeared.
