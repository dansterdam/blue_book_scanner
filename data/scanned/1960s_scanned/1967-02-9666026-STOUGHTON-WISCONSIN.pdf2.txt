Until approximately 9:30 p.m. on the evening of March 20, 1967, Mrs. Doris Gentry, a widow living alone in her home in Stoughton, Wisconsin, was doing her normal evening household chores.

At approximately 9:30 p.m., while working in her home, a bright light suddenly appeared outside the window. She immediately went to the window to investigate. Through the window, she observed a bright, circular, metallic-appearing object hovering over a field across the road from her home. The object was approximately 30 feet in diameter and about 40 to 50 feet above the ground.

Mrs. Gentry watched the object for about 15 minutes. During this time, it remained stationary, hovering over the field. She then decided to call her neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Steffes, who lived next door, to come and observe the object.

After Mrs. Gentry called the Steffes, the object suddenly and inexplicably began to move rapidly toward the northeast, accelerating to a very high rate of speed and disappearing from sight within a few seconds.

Mrs. Gentry reported that the object made no sound and gave off no exhaust or trail. She stated that it was the sort of thing that impressed her as being unusual and not of this world. Mrs. Gentry's description of the object was that it appeared to be circular, metallic, and bright, hovering silently and motionless over the field until it suddenly shot away at a very high rate of speed.
