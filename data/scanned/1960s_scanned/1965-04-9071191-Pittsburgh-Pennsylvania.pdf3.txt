ATTN OF: TDEW

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, Apr 65, Frickx Woods, Pittsburgh, Pa

TO: Hq USAF SAFOI-CC (Mrs Hunt)
WASH D C

Reference the attached letter from Mrs G C L.
regarding an observation by her daughter in April 1965. The following is a review of this matter for eighteen years and at present have on file more than 9,200 observations of which the observer could not identify.

Mrs. J. M. L. reports hallucinations, etc. The attached brochure is self-explanatory and describes the program to date.

Since the information, regarding your daughters observation, was insufficient for an evaluation, it is requested that the attached PIC-FTD form 36 be filled out by her and returned to this office.

Sincerely,

FOR THE COMMANDER

VICTOR J TRANTANELLA, JR
