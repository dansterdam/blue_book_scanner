Appendage to the Case:
Sighting, May 11, 1962.

Sighting at 9:15 p.m. on May 11, 1962 of a strange aerial object near Millsap, Texas. The object was described as a flat, elliptical, metallic-looking object with a row of lights around the edge. It was moving slowly in a zigzag pattern at an estimated altitude of 500 to 1000 feet. The object made no sound and was visible for about 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing.
The witness was a businessman who was accustomed to seeing conventional aircraft. He stated that the object was unlike anything he had ever seen before and did not resemble any known aircraft.
