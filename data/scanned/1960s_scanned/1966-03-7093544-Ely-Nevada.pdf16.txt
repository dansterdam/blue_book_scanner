That took about 10 minutes. Apparently some strange lights were observed in the hoizon. The lights first appeared quite suddenly, and began moving very slowly downward to describe an arc. About 1/2 hour later, they gone, too.

A comparison with a whitish saucer-shaped object was made. There is a good amount of details provided describing the characteristics of the lights and their movement. It seems that the event lasted for 10-15 minutes, with the first 3 lights being observed for a shorter duration compared to the subsequent 2 lights.
