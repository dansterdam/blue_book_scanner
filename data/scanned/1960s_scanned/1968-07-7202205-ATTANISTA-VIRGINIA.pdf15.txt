The handwritten response to "WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?" is:
We were returning from a carnival ride and I noticed what appeared to be a very bright star and it seemed to get a little closer to us, it was unusual because of the steady and unchanging bright light and also it did not seem to conform to the movement of the other stars in that portion of the sky. We watched it for several minutes and it did not seem to be moving very much, then suddenly it shot straight up at a terrific speed and disappeared entirely, the manner in which it disappeared was quite unnatural compared to an airplane or star or other familiar celestial objects, and that is what drew our attention to it in the first place.
