The handwritten text on the bottom of the sheet states:
"On the night of July 30 1960 was looking towards the southeast sky over [REDACTED]. I saw a bright blue light hover for several seconds and then shoot at a high rate of speed to the left over the horizon. The light shone very brightly and traveled very fast. I think the light was about 10 degrees above the horizon and approximately 30 degrees from due south."
