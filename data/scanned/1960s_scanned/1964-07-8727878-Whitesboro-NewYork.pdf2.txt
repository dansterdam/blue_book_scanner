Project Blue Book Investigation Report
27 July 1964
This is to report several phenomena which occurred at Whitesboro, New York, on the evening of July 26, 1964 at approximately 9:30 P.M. The first observation was made by a group of people. On the evening of July 26, 1964, at approximately 9:30 P.M. a group of people observed an object in the sky. This object was described as being round and seemed to change color from a reddish glow to a bright white light. The object moved rapidly and disappeared over the eastern horizon.

This is the general direction.

On the following night, at about 9:00 P.M. the object was sighted again by the observers. The object moved rapidly and ascended in the western sky, increasing in speed and disappearing from sight. 

It also passed and accelerated at a tremendous speed. The resemblance of the two sightings were identical and seemed to corroborate the information.
