11. The object was rounded at the top and tapered at the bottom. It was a brilliant white in color. The surface appeared to illuminate in spots and was somewhat blotchy or uneven as if the light or reflection were evolving. The edges were not sharp but were defined. However, the edges were sometimes obscured or fuzzy, as if they were wavering or moving. It appeared and disappeared behind clouds, and somewhat changed in shape during the time it was visible.
12. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT APPEARED LUMINOUS, AND DESCRIBE ANY UNUSUAL FEATURES SUCH AS CHANGES IN SHAPE, COLOR, OR BRIGHTNESS. INDICATE WHETHER ANY OTHER OBJECTS OR LIGHTS WERE IN THE FIELD OF VIEW.
It appeared to be oval or disk-shaped, and it was a brilliant, brilliant white in color. The surface was not entirely uniform, and seemed to be illuminating in spots, with the light or reflection evolving and changing. The edges were not sharply defined, but somewhat obscured or fuzzy, as if they were wavering or moving. It appeared and disappeared behind clouds, and somewhat changed in shape during the time it was visible. I have seen nothing with which to draw a comparison.
