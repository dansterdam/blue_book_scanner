Did it have any features comparable to a manned aircraft such as exhaust or vapor trail, or any wing or tail surface?
Not to my knowledge. Not that I could see. It did not. 
Was there any sound at this time?
I could hear no sound.
Could you give me an idea of the altitude or the angle from the ground?
It looked like it was approximately 7-8000 ft above the ground, the saurase at Provo. The location that was given to us was approximately over Provo. (and from this, distance is looked at)
What is the-do you know what the elevation is here?
At this airport? The elevation at this airport is 4240 ft.
This ship would be around 8000 ft?
Approximately 8000 at sea level.
And what would you estimate the distance from here?
The distance from here was approximately 30 miles.
And what direction would that be from the office here?
It would be directly south.
Due south.
Due south.
As you watched this, was there any flight path from east to west, up or down?
I noticed a flight path. I was watching it for approximately 5 minutes through the glasses and I noticed a flight path of straight up. And also to the west.
Was this flight at a rapid speed?
The flight upward was at a rapid speed. The flight to the west was fairly slow.
Were they rapid changes in direction?
The flight up was very rapid; the change to the west was not too rapid.
It wasn't an abrupt change?
No.
