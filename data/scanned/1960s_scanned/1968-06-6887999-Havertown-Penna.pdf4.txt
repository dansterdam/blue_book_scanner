THE UFO
One day at about ten p.m. I saw a UFO with my sister.
This UFO looked like a blinking light. It was flying across the sky, blinking. Then it suddenly went up in the sky. It then seemed to catch on fire like a burst of fire shooting out of its rear.
Then it seemed to go so fast into the sky that it finally went out of my vision.
I know this sounds like an optical illusion, but I would like to know if anyone else has seen this strange UFO (or thing). I am only 10, but I do know what I saw. Please give me an answer by baffling letter soon.
Sincerely,
E. Greer
