Dear Sirs:

I feel that the investigation of a UFO case that occurred in Nebraska, and photographic data is for the middle and third of August, is of considerable importance to my investigation.

I have been a member of the Los Angeles Astronomical Society for several years, and have observed numerous interesting astronomical objects. It is my objective to cooperate fully with the investigation of any UFO sightings, as I believe this to be an important area that may reveal information of a nature quite different from our present day scientific concepts.

If you are willing to examine my report and photographic data, please notify me, and the data will be forthcoming.
