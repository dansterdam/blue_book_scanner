MEMO FOR RECORD: at 1530 hours on 16 Jul 64, this officer received a call from Major L. Kennedy, Assistant Air Attache at Canada. He received a call from the USA in reference to certain UFO reports which were observed over St. Georges de Beauce, P.Q. on 15 Jul 64. This will be a place of an A/C for all they know. The instructions were to make an additional interview of the principal witness and obtain his latest estimate of the objects. The witness stated that he observed two objects on 15 Jul 64 at about 1800 hours. The objects appeared to be glass-like in nature, approximately 1/2 to 1 inch thick, pieces of dark material resembling metallic or glass-like material. The objects made no sound and hovered over the area for about 1 min. The witness has asked the FBI to try to get ahold of the objects for us. I told him that the objects will not be returned to him, as we will not be able to send report with objects. Objects were handled over to RCMP.
