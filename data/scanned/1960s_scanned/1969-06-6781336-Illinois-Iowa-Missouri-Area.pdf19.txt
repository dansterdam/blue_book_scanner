The image contains two sketches or illustrations, but no photographs. The first is a compass rose diagram, with instructions to place an "X" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a "+" at the position when last seen, and then connect the two with a line. The second illustration shows two landscape scenes, with a person standing in the foreground.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND THE "+" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. 

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND THE "+" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. ALSO, MAKE A SKETCH OF THE SHAPE AND CONFIGURATION OF THE PHENOMENON.
