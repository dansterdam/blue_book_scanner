The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes, it disappeared instantly.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (NO) Don't Know.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): (Yes) NO Don't Know. 
IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: A slight buzzing sound
b. Color: Bright glowing that changed color from bright white to orangish yellow

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? The match head would have covered about 1/3 of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch all the details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc, and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The drawing shows a sketch of a mushroom-shaped object with a pointed tip and a wider base, along with an elongated oval shape. An arrow is placed next to the drawing to indicate the direction of movement.
