The image contains a hand-drawn sketch or illustration in the center. It appears to depict some kind of elongated object or shape, but there is no clear photographic image in this document.

As an OCR system, the text I can extract from the document is:

INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE: ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

A short script appears below the sketch, but it is redacted or blacked out in the image, so I cannot extract any text from that portion.
