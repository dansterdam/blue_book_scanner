Rivergrove, Illinois

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

We are reviewing our unidentified flying object reports from November 1965. The report to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago has been forwarded to us. The information contained in this report is somewhat conflicting in that it states that the object was stationary and yet moved from east to west and was followed on extended visual observation.

In order to complete the attached Form 1612 and return them to our office at your convenience.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
GREGORY GILDENBERG, Jr., Major, USAF
CHIEF, PROJECT BLUE BOOK
