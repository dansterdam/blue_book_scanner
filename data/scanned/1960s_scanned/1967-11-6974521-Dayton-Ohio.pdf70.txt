The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a blank page within an older document, possibly a UFO report from Project Blue Book. The text at the top of the page indicates that this is a section where the person filling out the form can provide additional information that they feel is pertinent but not adequately covered in the questionnaire.

Extracting the text from the document:

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.
