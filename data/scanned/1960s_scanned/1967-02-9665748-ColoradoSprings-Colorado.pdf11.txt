The image does not contain any photograph or visual depiction. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, consisting entirely of text. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
No

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No   (Don't know.)  IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No   Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what it was in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color - Extremely bright, blueish-white, round shape

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object would have been covered by the match stick. If you held the match this experiment at the time. If not, estimate how much of the object would have been covered. 
Match stick covered approximately 1/3 to 1/4 of the object. Object extremely bright and large.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.
No sketch provided.
