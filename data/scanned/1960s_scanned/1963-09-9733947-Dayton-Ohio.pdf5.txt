27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the object shown. Place an "O" at the point where you were standing, and show how the object moved in relation to you. Use the compass directions shown below the sketch to indicate the direction of movement.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Describe a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
