Dear Sirs,

I read in today's newspaper of some people having contacted your office after seeing the bright object in the sky on Friday night. I saw it too, and wonder if this matter is being investigated. According to the government, it should not officially have been seen on that date.

I am talking about the calisthenic crowd when a large bright light was seen by many. It seemed much larger than the usual sighting, but seemed much higher than the nature of the "sparkler-ers" the children light and hold on the 4th of July, and it seemed to have flashed on and off quite nicely.

We said it sounded about a jet, and he teased me about "flying saucers", and then we did not give it more thought, till I saw this article in the Record. I felt it best to notify you for any records you see or such her.

Sincerely
