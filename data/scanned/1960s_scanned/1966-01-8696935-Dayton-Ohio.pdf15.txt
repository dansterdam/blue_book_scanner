Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433
26 January 66

Mr. [REDACTED]
Cincinnati 36, Ohio

Dear [REDACTED],

On 8 January a satellite, ECHO I, passed North of Cincinnati at 52 degrees elevation heading Southeast. This passed the satellite to the North and East of Cincinnati. No other unusual phenomena were observed simultaneously with a satellite sighting. Subsequently, ECHO I was seen from Cincinnati on 23 January passing from the North to the South. However, ECHO I will pass South of Cincinnati on 26 January at 52.13 AM EST and South of city, 23 degrees above horizon, at 25.18 AM EST on 27 January. So the satellite passage above described was not unusual.

Your observation was extremely accurate in describing the satellite motion and is consistent with our letter of 24 January. This is in response to your letter requesting additional data. Since the only other observation was the satellite passage, it is not necessary for you to call us on your telephone to identify it.

Sincerely,
VICTOR CHRISTIANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Aerospace Information Officer
