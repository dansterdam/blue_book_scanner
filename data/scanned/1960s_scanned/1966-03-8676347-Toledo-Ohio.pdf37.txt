The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted]

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your letter requesting our evaluation of your 23 March 1966 observation. A detailed photo analysis of the photograph was not possible because of scratches, fingerprints, lint, and dirt on the print. It is felt that the discernible images are those of the moon, its first quarter and other celestial bodies.

We wish you had spent more time observing the objects so that a more detailed account of the observation would have been possible.

A study of the submitted data did not reveal a positive explanation, but it appears that astronomical bodies were observed.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
