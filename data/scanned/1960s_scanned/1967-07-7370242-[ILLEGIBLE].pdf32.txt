At the time of the sighting, 2200 CDT 14 July 1967, the witness was on a return flight from Little Rock AFB to NAS Corpus Christi. The object appeared ahead of the aircraft and traveled across the flight path. It was a slightly curved flight path, beginning at an elevation about 60° and ending about 10° above the horizon. The object was described as a meteor, burning out as it reached an elevation of about 10° ahead of the aircraft. Upon landing at NAS Corpus Christi, the Duty Officer found that the witness was compiling information on a sighting received from several ground observers in the Corpus Christi area, who had reported seeing the object at the same time as the witness.
