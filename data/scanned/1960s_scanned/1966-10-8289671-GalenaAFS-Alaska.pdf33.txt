Witnesses did not seem to know what satellites look like.
The reports of type C are hardest to understand, since night aircraft activity is constant over Long Island. Probably the most noted effect was appearing as would happen if an aircraft moved toward or away from the observer, especially away from the observer. An airliner climbing and moving away may remain visible for 10 minutes in the same place. If such a climb is followed by a turn, the object may appear to hover for a while, and then move away at greater and greater speed, or it may change color as hidden lights come into view, or even abruptly disappear.
The sightings which remain unaccounted for are mostly similar to the others, but some appear is different enough to warrant further consideration. Some involve objects having definite shape, and these, unless the apparent shape can be accounted for, must remain UFO's for the time being at least.
Only one genuine UFO exists at present, the subject of at least five sightings at the same time and date (1800 to 1820, 30 October 1966). The object was a very bright light of regular shape (when observed) larger than the moon, which came over the area north of Southampton traveling southwest. This object was seen to stop and hover, from several angles, and then departed - the story of the departure is still somewhat confused. The origin of the object was close to the position of Cappella; it followed a path over a power line, made a swing to the west, and then moved southwest to hover just north of Southampton College. Flight time was on the order of 30 seconds to several minutes; hovering time is described as lasting anywhere from a few minutes to at least 20 minutes.
