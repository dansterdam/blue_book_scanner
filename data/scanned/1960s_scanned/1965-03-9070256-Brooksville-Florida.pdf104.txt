2. Further Speculation

We have made no chemical analyses of the markings and do not intend to do so. In my previous letter I commented that further microscopic examination had suggested the possibility of the markings having been produced by stamping or printing rather than by an instrument such as a pencil. We should like to elicit the services of someone who is familiar with this type of work and could have been made acquainted with a special type of pencil used in photographic retouching. Some of these pencils were made available thru J. S. Staedtler in this country.

Further speculation about the nature of the markings brought out the comment that the markings might have been made with the aid of some special instruments like a stamp or a device similar to a typewriter. In other words, they were not made by someone who was acquainted with a writing material, a commercial artist, or someone with similar skills.

If there is any way in which we can be of further assistance to the Air Force or to any agency investigating related aspects, please feel free to call upon us.

Very truly yours,

T. A. Howells, Chairman
