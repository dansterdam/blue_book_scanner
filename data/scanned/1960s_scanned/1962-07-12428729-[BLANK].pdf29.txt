Text from the document:

There is a continuing interest in the objects observed and reported by the public as unidentified flying objects. Widespread public interest and some official concern over unidentified flying objects have led to the initiation of a scientific study of this problem by the Air Force. This study is being conducted by the Air Force under the code name 'Project Blue Book'. The project was originally established in 1947 under the name 'Project Sign' and was redesignated 'Project Grudge' in 1949. In 1952 the name was changed to 'Project Blue Book'.

The project's primary mission is to determine if any unidentified flying objects pose a threat to the security of the United States, to gather technical data that may have scientific value, and to determine if any reported objects are the result of foreign aircraft activity or research and development projects of the United States. Reports of unidentified flying objects are received and evaluated by this project.

Lighting or radar sightings are often reported as unusual objects in the sky. Experienced in the field of aircraft identification and familiar with natural atmospheric phenomena, the investigators are often able to identify the reported object as a known aircraft, a natural phenomenon, or a misinterpretation of a familiar object.

When a sighting cannot be immediately identified, further investigation is undertaken to determine the origin and nature of the report. This may involve interviewing witnesses, checking weather records, and analyzing physical evidence when available. If the investigation fails to identify the object, the report is classified as 'unidentified'.

UFO sightings are reported to provide aerial phenomena with information regarding national security, such as the presence of foreign aircraft over the United States. To accomplish this mission, the Air Force has established procedures to rapidly evaluate each report to determine the nature of the object. Many items are quickly identified as known objects. When a report cannot be identified, the case is classified for further study.
