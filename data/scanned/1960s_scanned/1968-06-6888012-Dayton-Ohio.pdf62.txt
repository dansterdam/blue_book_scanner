MEMO FOR THE RECORD
1 JULY 1968

SUBJ: UFO SIGHTING OF 16 JUNE 1968

Called Sulfur Grove and asked if they had launched a balloon on 16 June 1968 that would have been able to be seen from 6:45 pm to 7:20 pm. The weather officer said although the records had been destroyed it certainly could have been one of their balloons. Ordinarily they launch the balloons at 6:00 pm plus or minus ½ hr and that the balloon can sometimes be seen for as long as 1½ hrs. The balloon is on top under which is attached a hoop to stabilize the parachute. A cable hangs down from the balloon and at the end a small payload is attached.
