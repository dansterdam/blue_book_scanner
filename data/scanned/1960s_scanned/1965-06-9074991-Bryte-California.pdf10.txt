NORTHERN IRELAND
Zeppelin* over Belfast
The object, travelling from South to North, is said by civil servant William Brady of Upper Malone to have been sighted at 5.45 p.m. He says that the object looked like one of the old-time Zeppelin airships travelling from East to West. It was daylight, and the object was in view for ten seconds. (Credit: T. Thompson)
