The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The diagram includes a compass rose, as well as instructions for drawing the path of motion of an object or objects. The text on the page appears to be instructions for the viewer, asking them to imagine a scenario and draw a picture accordingly.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass to show the direction the object was traveling.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
