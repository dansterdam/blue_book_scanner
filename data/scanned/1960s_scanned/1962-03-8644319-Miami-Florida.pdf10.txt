First Observation
The sky was hazy in the south and quite bright in the north after daylight by contrast. The object (__redacted__) and myself) but a 3-4-inch reflecting telescope, 80X zoom binoculars, extreme near sightedness, poor focusing, and weather did not permit more definitive observation. At 8:25 PM one of the boys (either __redacted__ or __redacted__) exclaimed, "There's a meteor!" On first observation it appeared stationary, but on closer inspection it had the appearance of a fuzzy star about 1.5" in diameter. It decreased in intensity - it appeared to be traveling toward the southeast. They appeared to approximately (sic) 12-15 seconds color. As the object passed, the same witnesses observed the appearance of a smaller satellite or satellite-like object following the main object. They appeared to approximately the same color.
