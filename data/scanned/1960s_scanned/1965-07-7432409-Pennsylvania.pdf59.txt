13 Jul 65 call made to Goldanski, ONR, at the DOD, phone Liberty 5 - 6700, ext 64723, Office of Naval Research. They launch from Churchill, Canada. It was not their balloon, positive no. All theirs are accounted for. There's fly around 100,000 ft.

13 Jul 65 called Lockbourne AFB, 301st Intelligence, spoke with Colonel Patterson who said they had had some UFO activity and some reports. Put Lt Hender on phone to get Major Quintanilla's phone number etc. It was a Lt Taylor who handled reports. Hender's said they had no information on object, also he said he saw object for about ten minutes. They said that Lockbourne had not put up any jets to look for object.

At 1500 hours on 13 Jul 65 Major Stiles from SAFOI called. Major Quintanilla informed him that we have been trying to get through to him. It was his unfortunate experience to answer the phone since Sara was out because news agencies and Scrip Hover and others were asking about UFOs over Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Indiana. Major explained that one of the earlier observations at Davis, Ohio was a weather balloon seen at 65,000 ft. Other observations were a high altitude balloon with gondola. We have not found who launched this balloon, however we are continuing to research. Balloon launchers at Sulpher Grove said that it was an upper air research balloon with package, also F-102 pilots over Pittsburgh went up and observed the balloon with a gondola attached.
