TEMPLE, OKLAHOMA 
23 MARCH 1966

Observer was driving his car along the highway at approximately 0505, 23 March 1966, when he noticed an object parked on the road in front of him. He stopped the car and got out so as to get a better view of the object. The object was so parked that it blocked out a portion of a road curve sign. There were no sharp edges noted by the observer. The object had the appearance of a conventional aircraft (C-124) without wings and motors. There was a plexiglas bubble on top, similar to a B-26 canopy. As observer approached, he noticed a man wearing a baseball cap enter the object by steps from the bottom. After the man had entered the object, it began to rise from the pavement and headed on a southeasterly direction at approximately 720 mph. The objects had forward and aft lights that were very bright. As the object rose from the ground, a high speed drill type of sound was heard, plus a sound like that of a welding rod when an arc is struck. Object was 75' long, nearly 8' from top to bottom and about 12' wide. There were some type of supports on the bottom of the object.

After the object disappeared the witness got back into his car and drove approximately fifteen miles down the highway. At this time the original witness stopped and talked with another individual who had also stopped along the roadway to watch some lights over Red River which is approximately five - six miles to the SE.

COMMENTS: 
Various organizations were contacted around the Temple area for a possible experimental or conventional aircraft. The observer stated that he thought the object was some type of Army or Air Force research aircraft. All attempts at such an explanation proved fruitless, since there were no aircraft in the area at the time.
