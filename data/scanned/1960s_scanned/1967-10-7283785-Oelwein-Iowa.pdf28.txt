PART II - NONE. PART I. NONE. PART 4. LOCAL AIRPORT REPORTED ONLY NORMAL TRAFFIC. PART K. PREPARING OFFICER IS INTELLIGENCE OFFICER OF 733 RADAR SQ. WAVERLY AFS, IOWA. I BELIEVE THIS OBJECT IS A PLANE ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS DOUBTFUL THAT A PLANE WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE FOR SO LONG, EVEN THOUGH OBJECT WAS PROBABLY A PLANE. I'M SUBMITTING A REPORT BECAUSE IT WAS SIGHTED BY THE AREA NEWS MEDIA.
