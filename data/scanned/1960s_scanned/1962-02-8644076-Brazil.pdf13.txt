WITNESS: D - SHEFFIELD: Last Feb.,1962, a Mr. John Shaw and David Brown were taking an afternoon walk near Sheffield, England, when they saw five dark objects in the sky. They were not moving and made no sound. The objects were estimated to be about 100 to 200 yards away. The time was about 1300 hours. The objects were seen for about 10 minutes. Mr. Shaw managed to take a camera photo of the objects before they disappeared. No lights or vapour trails were seen. The photo was passed on to the authorities, and it was later examined by experts. The initial assessment seemed to indicate that the objects were real and not some kind of hoax or trick photography. However, the conclusive nature of the evidence was not entirely clear and the matter remains unresolved. The photograph shows several dark, indistinct objects in the sky.
