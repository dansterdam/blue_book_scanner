Victoria Launschlin, A Weather Balloon?
The unidentified flying object/vehicle, They said it was cigar shaped, sighted over La Porte, Texas at 5:15 a.m. Sunday probably was a weather balloon launched from Victoria, Texas, according to Clyde Young, meteorologist at the Victoria Weather Station.
The object was seen by several persons, including Victoria Launschlin, who called it a "UFO." It looked about 15-20 feet long and 5-6 feet in diameter, and was sighted in a westerly direction, moving slowly at first but then accelerating and moving out of sight in about 10-15 minutes. The object also was seen by other persons in other directions.
According to Young, the object likely was a weather balloon launched from Victoria at about 4:30 a.m., which would account for its location and movements as described. He said weather balloons of that type are quite common in the area.
