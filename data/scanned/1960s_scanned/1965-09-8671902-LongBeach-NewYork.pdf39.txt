This refers to your earlier telephone conversation to identify a bright object sighted on the night of 6 Sep 65.

This office has completed its investigation of the sighting of the metallic object reported by you. Based on the information you provided, we have determined that the sighting was of a high-altitude illumination flare dropped by an aircraft in support of training operations.

I regret any inconvenience this may have caused you. However, I trust this information helps to resolve your concern. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact me again.

Sincerely,
