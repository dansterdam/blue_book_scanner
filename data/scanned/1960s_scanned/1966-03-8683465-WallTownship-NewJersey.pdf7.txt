Major Hector Quintanilla,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Foreign Technology Division,
Dayton, Ohio.

Dear Major,

As per our telephone conversation of Friday, May 13, I am sending you all the information I have on this reported UFO.
I have no personal comment on its being right or wrong, but at the behest of authorities at Fort Monmouth, N.J., I am sending it all to you.

In regard to your questions:
1. The 3.00 camera used has two positions, under 15 feet and from 15 to 300 feet.
2. The UFO was first seen, he says, at about 3,000 feet. Then dropped down to 600 to 750 feet.
3. The inexpensive camera has no "f" stops, only a spring-operated shutter.
4. It uses 120 film, kodak, and the film was developed locally.
5. The camera is a Fals, or something like that. Not a standard make.

I hope this will help you. I would appreciate your returning the film, if at all possible.

Sincerely,
Frank L. Wilgus
Coordinator
