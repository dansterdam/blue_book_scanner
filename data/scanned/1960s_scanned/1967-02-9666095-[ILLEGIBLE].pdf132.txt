The image appears to be a page from an official U.S. Air Force document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains sketches, diagrams, and handwritten notes, but no photograph is present.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, indicate the position of the object shown. Place an "A" on the drawing to show how the object appeared when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the drawing to show how the object appeared when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path.

29. If there was LESS THAN ONE object, how many were there?
There was at least 2-3 objects, as they were arranged in a triangular formation and traveling.
