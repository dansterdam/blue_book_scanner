A very strange occurrence is reported in the February 5th edition of the "Flying Saucers" magazine. The dimensions of the circular objects observed are given. These are shown in the illustration above. (The dimensions are in meters). The objects were said to be glowing with an intense heat in the white areas shown in the diagram. It is strange that no depth was observed, but it was illuminated that it appeared to be some kind of solid object. However, there was no evidence of actual landing, it was also calculated that the object could have been about 30 meters in diameter. No explanation for them could be found.
