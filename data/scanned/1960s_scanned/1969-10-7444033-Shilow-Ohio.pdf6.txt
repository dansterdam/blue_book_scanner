The image contains two black and white illustrations. The top illustration is a compass rose, which appears to be providing instructions on how to indicate the direction of a phenomenon when it is first seen. The bottom illustrations show two sketches - one appears to be a landscape view, and the other appears to be a smaller sketch provided as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
