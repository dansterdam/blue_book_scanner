NORTH CENTRAL UNITED STATES 
16 AUGUST 1966

At approximately 22:45 CDT, 16 August 1966 an "unidentified flying object" was observed in the northern sky. Four occupants of one car reported that after seeing an object that began to which change colors, heading toward their car, they turned the car in the opposite direction and drove away. The object appeared to rise up from behind the woods and after a pause began to ascend once more. Object was reported to vary in size from that of a full moon to that of a football field with blue, green, and faint red whirling lights turning to a definite blue-green as the object came closer. At one time, it appeared that a hazy green funnel went down from the object to the ground. As the object rose from the woods the brightness was compared to an early morning sun and gave off so much light it blinded the observer's eyes. It seemed that the object was coming toward the earth at a tremendous rate of speed.

The alleged UFO was also observed by a private pilot as he was approaching Madison, Wisconsin. To this observer, the object changed shapes from more shaped to oval and finally to an elongated "V" or boomerang shape. The pilot was flying at approximately 165 knots and the object was keeping pace with him. Other aircraft pilots reported similar sightings with very consistent descriptions.

Still other witnesses reported a green luminous object varying in size, that appeared to have exploded and faded in a haze. There was basically no movement of the alleged object as it slowly disappeared from view. In another instance the object dissolved into streaks of light before vanishing.
