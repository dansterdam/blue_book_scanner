Dear Sir:

An article in today's Clearwater Sun asks that we write you if we saw the six red lights in the sky Saturday night.

We were watching television and suddenly noticed the lights. They were very bright and seemed to be moving erratically. At first we thought they were flares, but then we noticed that they were hovering and not dropping downward as flares would.

After about five minutes, they seemed to move closer together and then disappeared altogether. We were looking for my telescope, but before we could find it, they were gone.

We were wondering if we form any condition of what they were. We are certain that we saw them and that they went through the described maneuvers. The Clearwater fireworks display was on and the display lights.

Our home address is the same as our business address.

Very truly yours,
