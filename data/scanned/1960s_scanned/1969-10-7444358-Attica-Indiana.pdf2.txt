10-7-69
North North East 9:00 P.M. To 9:15 P.M.

First saw bright star (like) star(s), North North East of our house, My 13 year old son saw it 100, through Field glass, To me it looked as though moving, actually grown red, to white, to green. This very suddenly (starting from brown) to 2 in about 1hr:15 min.
In all this time, there was no report on T.V. about U.F.O. We went to bed. N.W.S. or other red blinking UFO. The distance appeared to be about 1/2 to 3/4 mile. 10:10 P.M. N.N.E. from W. to E. Red blinking U.F.O.
Moving from E. to W. Saw this. From time to time my husband & our 7 children have watched these.
I haven't sent this sooner, because of illness in family, I didn't have time to write till now.
Still Awaiting accidental sightings, but more stands.
