Are they taking any actions? - No NORAD is getting several reports of sightings, but there is nothing to it as far as we can determine.

Now are you still there? Right. Listen there is one entry to the GI Army Dep-t. I believe I did pass on this. That is the weather Colonel. I believe it did go on up right away. Listen this is Mr. Bolling at 2152. NORAD has received two reports today but neither had anything associated with it by darkness. You know what time is it there now? Is it still daylight? Stand by. Okay, what is it they are saying? Well, it sounds like Burl Rogers and the people have been made aware of the incident under twilight conditions. Well sir, I'd say they would know more about it than we do here, we're just getting the information from them, after midnight last night and I've been listening to everyone of them. Well let's see what other incidents we have here. It would be less than one minute ago that this was seen at 1017. I would estimate it began around the end of the twilight to dusk or darkness. Keep his profound this sighting for intelligence purposes shall we? Okay, thanks. Bye.

NO - OKAY thanks. They are not getting any sightings other than those that are reported from the SAC people. The had reports that were published in the news media and sent in from SAC. Are there any UFO sightings here we thought were identical? Well okay, as long as we're following our normal reporting channels, we'll keep you informed on these which we receive. When our data is as up as their data, we had similar reports from the objects in the sky as they did from SAC. Does this reach a point where your own observations stand? We have no such instructions. No. Okay and thank you/observations. We have no such instructions.
