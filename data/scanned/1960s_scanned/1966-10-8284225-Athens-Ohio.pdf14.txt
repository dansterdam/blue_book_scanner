The document contains two sketches and not photographs. The first sketch shows a curved arc with angle measurements and a compass rose. It includes labels "A" and "B" at different points on the angle arc and the compass rose. The second sketch illustrates three different motion paths of an unidentified object with labels "A" and "B" to indicate the start and end points, respectively. The third sketch demonstrates two objects with arrows to indicate their traveling directions and notes on their movement pattern.

Here is the text contained in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how
high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to
show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass
when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

90°
75°
60°
45°
30°
15°
0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the
path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

OBJECT I.
1.
OBJECT II.
2.
OBJECT 111:
3.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

BOTH OBJECTS WERE ABOUT THE SAME WIDTH + SEPARATION
THAT THEY AT ONE TIME MOVED IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
AND AT ONE TIME WERE BOTH VISIBLE IN THE BINOCULARS 
CROSSING.
