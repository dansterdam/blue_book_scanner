I served in the USAAF during WWII as a B-17 pilot from 1943-1945. I have been an avid aircraft enthusiast all my life and feel I am quite capable of identifying various aircraft and aerial phenomena. The object I observed on October 9, 1964 was unlike any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. It hovered silently for several minutes before rapidly accelerating and disappearing from sight. I immediately reported the incident to the local authorities.

33. What and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
I reported the sighting to the Chicago office of the USAF on October 10, 1964.
