The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document with text describing an object observed on July 29th, which was described as a "huge red ball" and was reportedly visible for several seconds.

A large portion of the text reads: "At about 10:30 pm on the evening of July 29th, 1960, residents of Columbus, Ohio witnessed the sight of a huge red ball moving across the sky for several seconds. Local eyewitnesses reported that the object appeared to be 'several feet in diameter' and was traveling at a high rate of speed."
