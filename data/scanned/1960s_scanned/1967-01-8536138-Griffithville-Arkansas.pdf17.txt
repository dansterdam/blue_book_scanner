TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,

THIS IS TO REPORT THE SIGHTING OF AN 
UNUSUAL LIGHT PHENOMENON IN THE SKY.

PLACE: ISLAMORADA, IN THE FLORIDA KEYS, ON THE BEACH OF THE MOTEL 
LA JOLLA WHERE I WAS VACATIONING.

TIME: I EITHER THE 5TH THE 7TH OR THE 8TH OF JANUARY 1957 - I DO
NOT REMEMBER EXACTLY. AT ABOUT 8:30 AT NIGHT.

DESCRIPTION:

I WAS ALONE, LOUNGING IN A BEACH CHAIR (RECLINING) AND LOOKING AT THE 
SKY OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND THE STARS SHINING 
BRIGHTLY, EXCEPT FOR A FEW SMALL AND VERY VAPOROUS CLOUDS SCATTERED
HERE AND THERE AND PUSHED BY A BLOW EASTERLY WIND.

I WAS TRYING TO FIND THE NORTH STAR. I FINALLY IDENTIFIED - OR THOUGHT
I IDENTIFIED - CASSIOPEIA. IT TOOK ME A FEW SECONDS TO UNDERSTAND ITS
UNUSUAL POSITION: I HAD NOT REALIZED THAT, SINCE I HAD COME 2000 MILES
SOUTH OF QUEBEC, THE ANGLE OF THE NORTH STAR WITH THE HORIZON WAS 
GREATLY DIFFERENT AT ISLAMORADA.

SUDDENLY, 15 OR 20° SOUTH OF CASSIOPEIA AND 20 OR 25° ABOVE THE HORIZON,
I SAW A LIGHT MOVING UPWARDS, WHICH I TOOK FOR A SHOOTING STAR, JUST A
LITTLE BIGGER THAN A SHOOTING STAR. THE COLOR OF WHICH WAS WHITE WITH
A GREENISH HUE. AT ABOUT 15° ABOVE THE HORIZON, THE LIGHT JERKED SUDDENLY
TO MY RIGHT AND TRAVELLED MORE OR LESS NORTH, AT A RIGHT ANGLE WITH ITS
PREVIOUS DIRECTION, FOR ABOUT 25°, THEN JERKED SUDDENLY AGAIN IN A
NORTH OR LESS NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION, WENT DOWN FOR ABOUT 15 OR 20° AND
DISAPPEARED.
