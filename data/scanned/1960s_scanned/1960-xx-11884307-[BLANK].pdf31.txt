The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

Newhouse - Utah Case: Movies were studied by Photo Reconnaissance Laboratory (WADC) in 1952, shortly after sighting took place. Their considered opinion was that these were strong possibility that there were sea gulls appearing thermal air currents, and appearing as bright spots of light similar to those shown in the movie. Our files show that this report was counter-signed by Captain Ruppelt.
Also, our original evaluation was based, in part, on movies of sea gulls taken at various distances which showed that the sea gulls appeared similar to the objects in the film. This film was shown by Captain Ruppelt at a private showing in Washington which was also attended by Dr. Hynek. Further, a critical analysis made a few days ago of this film strip by ATIC photo specialists, without their knowledge of the original evaluation, resulted in the same opinion i.e. that these were sea gulls. It should also be pointed out that in our copy of the original film, sea gulls appeared in a number of frames. This, however, is not shown in the Hollywood version of the film. Therefore, there is in this case also no compelling reason to change our original opinions.
