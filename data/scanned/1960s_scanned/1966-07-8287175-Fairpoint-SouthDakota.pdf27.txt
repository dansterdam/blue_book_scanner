There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing instructions and questions related to the reporting of UFO sightings.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve
that the object was above (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve where you
saw the object again (if you saw it again). Place a "C" on the curve where you last saw the
object when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the
start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
