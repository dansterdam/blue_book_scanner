REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (VENEZUELA, 10-4-60)
1. On 4 October 1960, at 1915 hours, LUZ MARiNEZ, resident of PUERTO NUEVO, Venezuela, reported observing a bright object in the sky over MARACAIBO, Venezuela, moving from east to west at a high rate of speed. The object was described as having a circular shape and emitting a bright glow. It was observed for approximately 45 seconds before disappearing from view.
2. The object was initially sighted at an estimated altitude of 35,000 feet and was moving at an estimated speed of 2,000 miles per hour. It was reported that the object appeared to abruptly change direction and accelerate during the observation.
3. It has been definitively established that the United States military satellite 1959 IOTA was in the area at the reported time of observation. However, the description of the object as being circular in shape and emitting a bright glow is not consistent with the characteristics of a satellite.
4. Suggest your further a further investigation, his want to cooperate fully and provide any additional information that may be available.
