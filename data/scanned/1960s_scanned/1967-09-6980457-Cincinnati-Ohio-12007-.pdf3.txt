CINCINNATI, OHIO - 12007
AERIAL PHENOMENA
This incident occurred on 6 September 1967 at approximately 3:20 A.M. At this time, the witness, an air traffic controller working in the control tower at the Greater Cincinnati Airport, observed a large, oval-shaped object in the sky to the east of the airport. The object was described as having a hazy, indistinct outline and appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly. The witness watched the object for several minutes, noting that it seemed to be luminous or self-illuminating. After approximately 5 minutes, the object appeared to accelerate and moved rapidly to the northeast, disappearing from view.

The witness was an experienced air traffic controller who was very familiar with various types of aircraft. He stated that the object he observed was unlike any conventional aircraft he had seen before. The weather at the time was clear, with good visibility. No other witnesses could be located.

This report was forwarded to Project Blue Book for evaluation. The case was classified as "UNIDENTIFIED" by the Project Blue Book staff.
