The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a letter from the Air Force regarding an unidentified sighting on April 13, 1962 at Nellis AFB in Nevada. The letter states that the reported track is characteristic of that registered by a U-2 or high-altitude balloon, but there is insufficient data to fully support such an evaluation. The phenomena reported was not intercepted or fired upon.

September 21, 1962

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

The official records of the Air Force list the 13 April 1962 Nevada sighting to which you refer as "unidentified". Insufficient data is available to determine if the track characteristics are those of a U-2 or a high balloon, but there is insufficient data reported to fully support such an evaluation. The phenomena reported was not intercepted or fired upon.

Sincerely,

C. B. HART, Major, USAF
