AFR 80-17(C1)
NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONSIDER THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "Y", THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS STRAIGHT, ERRATIC, CURVED OR ZIG ZAG. REFER TO DETAILS OF SUCH MOVEMENT.
