DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES JAN. 13-19, 1969

The Surface weather Map presents the locations of high and low pressure systems, cold and warm fronts, and other pertinent meteorological data. The plotted stations show the wind direction and speed, the temperature, and the type and amount of precipitation as indicated by recognized symbols. The map covers the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. EST. The isobar spacing of 4 millibars shows the intensity of the systems and the general circulation pattern.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the contour patterns and the current departures from normal temperatures at the 500-millibar level, which is located approximately 18,000 feet above sea level. The contours show the position and intensity of the major upper-air features. Temperatures shown on the chart are departures from normal. The heights of the contours and the temperature pattern indicate the general circulation pattern.

The Prognostic Charts indicate the expected location and intensity of high and low pressure systems, fronts, and precipitation areas for the 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m. EST the following day. The 500-millibar Prognostic Chart indicates the expected pattern at the 500-millibar level.
