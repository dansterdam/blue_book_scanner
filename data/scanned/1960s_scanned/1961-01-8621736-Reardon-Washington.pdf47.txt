CASE: 
SHAPE: OVAL BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT. 
TIME: APPROX 12:21 A.M., OSI., SUBJECT OBSERVED FOR A PERIOD OF 10 MINUTES 
APPARENT ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PENNY AT ARM'S LENGTH. WITH AN OUTLINE OR A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT AROUND IT FLASHING RAPIDLY. THESE FLASHES WOULD VARY IN INTENSITY . GO FROM A VERY BRIGHT TO DULL ALMOST TO BLACK. THEN SUDDENLY BRIGHT AGAIN. AS IF THERE WAS A RAPIDLY MOVING FORCE OR MECHANISM WITHIN IT CONTROLLING THE FLASHING. 
IT MOVED AT HIGH RATES OF SPEED, FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST. COMPLETELY OUT OF SIGHT IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS. 
IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 2,000 FEET IN ALTITUDE. THEY APPEARED TO BE ROUND AND THEY WERE LEAVING A WHITE SINGLE RAGGED TAIL ABOUT 10 FEET LONG IN THEIR TRAJECTORY. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A LIGHT SMALLER THAN THE FULL MOON. SEVERAL TIMES BRIGHTER THAN ANY STAR IN THAT PORTION OF THE SKY. ITS LIGHT WAS A CLEAR WHITE LIGHT. 
CASE OVER. PARA: ML- HE IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT WHATEVER HE SAW WAS NOT ANYTHING FROM THIS WORLD. HE FEELS THAT THE OB.IECT HAS CHARACTERISTICS OF OTHER UFOs WHICH WE HAVE HAD REPORTED AND THAT IT WAS A INTELLIGENTLY CONTROLLED FLIGHT. HE STATED THAT HE HAS HAD A LIFE LONG INTEREST IN THE PHENOMENON OF UFOs AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE HAS ACTUALLY OBSERVED WHAT HE WOULD CALL A UFO IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD. HE FURTHER STATED THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY TAKEN BY SURPRISE AT FIRST OBSERVATION OF THE OBJECT.
