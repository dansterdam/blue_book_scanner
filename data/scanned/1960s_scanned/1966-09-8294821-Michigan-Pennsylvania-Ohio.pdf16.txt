SMITHSONIAN INVESTIGATING
Did Meteorite Fall Here?
BY WALTER RYBECK
WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 - The Daily News Bureau
- For a spectacular fireball identified as an exploding meteorite flashed across the eastern United
States Saturday evening, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Institution meteorologist was trying to unravel the mystery of a specimen that came down in 1932 or 1933.
E. P. Henderson, a research associate in the Smithsonian's division of meteorites, is seeking that the specimen fell on a farm in either Michigan, Pennsylvania or Ohio.
Even 35 years ago, Dayton was a flourishing city, and he had visited several sites of such a fall, Henderson said.
"BY MY QUESTION, the identity of the individual L. P. Kover, who, as a University of Cincinnati student in 1935, sent the item. Do probably reported the specimen to the Smithsonian," Henderson went on.
