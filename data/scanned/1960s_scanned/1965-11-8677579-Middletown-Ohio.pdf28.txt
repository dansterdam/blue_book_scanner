MEMO FOR THE RECORD

On the night of 14 November 1965, Sgt Moody received a telephone call from the desk Sgt from the Middletown, Ohio police station. The Sgt informed Sgt Moody that an object was visible to the South and had been reported by several persons in the area. This object or a similar object was observed on the previous night. On the night of 14 November, the object had been observed for about an hour and was still visible. Sgt Moody looked at the object with binoculars and observed a star slightly below and to the left of Venus and another object higher in elevation and to the left of the planet Venus. He requested that the police officer observe the object at Middletown, to determine if a star was low and to the left, and if there was another object to the left and above the planet. The patrolman at Middletown looked at this object and observed the same stars adjacent to the planet Venus. Sgt Moody informed him that Venus would move 15 degrees in azimuth toward the west in descending path until disappearance about 3:30. He told the patrolman that if the object being observed did not conform with this predicted flight path, to call back. No additional calls were received.
