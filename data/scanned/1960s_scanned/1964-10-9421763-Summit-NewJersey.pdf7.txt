Dear Mr. __________,

This is in reply to your letter of February 8, 1965.

The current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force's investigation of UFO sightings, shows this case was closed in 1950. This project has been known in the press as the 'Flying Saucer" project, however, it has been inactive for some years.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
Lt Colonel, USAF
