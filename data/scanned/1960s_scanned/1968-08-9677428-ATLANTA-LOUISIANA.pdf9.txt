This page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book does not contain any visible photograph or image. The document appears to provide instructions and guidelines for submitting and describing UFO-related photographs, but no actual photograph is shown on this particular page.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

15. SHOW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HELP DESCRIBE THE OBJECT. THE PHOTOGRAPH SHOULD BE CLEAR AND INDICATE CLEARLY BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT CAN THE ANGULAR SIZE, HELD A PATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A GROWN ADULT, SUCH AS A STREET AND OF HOUSES, INDICATE? THE GENERAL SIZE AND DISTANCE OR LOCATION OF THE PHENOMENON COULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
