The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a report on a UFO observation.

Proposed reply to letter from 6 January 1967
Dear [redacted],
Reference your letter of 6 January 1967 reporting a 1960 unidentified flying object (UFO) observation. At such a late date, a comprehensive study would be extremely difficult. Since records of air activity are normally destroyed several months after their use, there would be practically no records to check in an attempt to determine the actual stimulus. The information will be filed and referred to the present data base.
Thank you, your interest in our program is appreciated.
