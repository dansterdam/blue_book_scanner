There does not appear to be any photograph present in this scanned document page. The document contains text only, which I will transcribe as follows:

Hynek: Do you think there is any possibility that what you saw and what the others saw was different?

That is a possibility, but I doubt it because it seemed to have been of the same type of motion to it. It truly did, although it wasn't in the same spot as I came in. I came in the house and we went outside, but it was the same sort of personal... 

Hynek: I was wondering about when Mr. Fogg came out and said "Oh, that's the moon"?

At first glance they were laughing, but then they watched it for a couple more seconds and then said, "Hey, it's moving". As you watched it more, it seemed itself to be definitely not the moon. When you first glance you see a light in the sky and when you see it like that it looked like the moon, but then as you see it actually moving and changing color the way it did, and the small which it left, you could definitely tell it was not the moon.

Hynek: The calculation shows that the moon came up at 11:36 and an hour from then it would have been about 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon, and almost directly in the east, and it would have looked like a quarter of a pie.

I'd feel better myself if it had been the moon, but to be truthful I notice it mainly because my eyes were just looking directly at that without your glasses away.

Hynek: Well, certainly, I would say that the first part of your sighting couldn't possibly have been the moon.

That definitely was not the moon, but then what my in-laws and I saw I'm pretty sure was definitely the real thing because I would not have been attracted to it. But something that I did see did attract me and it frightened me although I remained calm, and it was exactly as I told you just the same sort of movement. Like when I was coming into the house, it seemed to sort of personality and movement, although it was not in the same spot as before I came into the house. I'd be willing to get together...

Hynek: I'll be in Dayton again. I get there about once every month and a half.

Hynekness: I'm ready to go back down to the campus in Yellow Springs this week.

Hynek: There is a possibility that I will be in Cincinnati on Oct 9. May I have your address?
