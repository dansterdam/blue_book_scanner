Auroras in September

A phenomenon appeared in the sky at about 9:30 p.m. on September 3, 1963, from Middletown, New Jersey. The phenomenon was observed by several persons, including a professional astronomer, and was described as resembling an aurora. The witnesses stated that the display was very bright, and that it seemed to last for about two hours. It was seen in the northern part of the sky.
