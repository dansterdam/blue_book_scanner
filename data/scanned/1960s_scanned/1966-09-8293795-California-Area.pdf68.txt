There does not appear to be any photograph included in this image. The image shows a handwritten letter on what appears to be official stationery.

Gentlemen:

While taking some pictures from the surfacing of the ocean (and showing certain birds and into a stream of birds I saw) some pictures I trust mine could do from them. I have seen a few pictures that took quite a lot of times and took these of theirs an all after seeing another. (I do not believe they are flying around -- but Varian, of Brown Univ. took film)

Now, however, I would beg leave you examine those migratory committee find those into such actions and which to be cared to forward them on it and notice to be interested in seeing them. 

If anyone should to send them additional copy this letter -- or it's trancharencies. Ihope you for any information you can give me.

Yours Truly,
[Redacted]
