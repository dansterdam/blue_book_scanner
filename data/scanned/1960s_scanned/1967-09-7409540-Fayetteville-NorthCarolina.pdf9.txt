The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a document page from Project Blue Book with a hand-drawn sketch and written responses to questions about a UFO sighting.

"14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
yes

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): YES   NO   Don't Know.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound a slight swishing sound

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About 1/3

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving."
