11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The witness reported that he observed the first light he thought was an aircraft, since he was watching the airplanes flying over the Princeton Airport. However, as time passed, the light appeared to stop, hover, and then take off in an erratic manner, disappearing from view. The object was viewed by another observer, and the witness estimated that it was about the size of a small airplane. The object emitted a bright light beam, and a small, non-blinking light was visible. The object's behavior was considered unusual for an aircraft.
