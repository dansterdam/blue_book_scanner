Now, as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract all the text found in the document:

29 2 U of 29/04/64
1. CIVILIANS
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS 5
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION 10 MINUTES
7. TYPE OF OBSERVATION Ground-Visual
9. PHOTOS XXXX
10. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE XXXX
2. LOCATION NEAR LANARK, INDIANA
C. BOTH THE OBSERVER AND DATA ARE ANALYZED
ALTHOUGH BOTH THE OBSERVER AND WITNESS ARE VERY RELIABLE AND CREDIBLE, THEIR DESCRIPTION IS SOMEWHAT SCANTY. HOWEVER, AS CAN BE SEEN FROM THEIR SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THEY PROBABLY SIGHTED A WHITE SQUARE OBJECT THAT APPEARED TO BE A SMALL CUSHION-SHAPED CLOUD OBJECT AND THAT IT BEHAVED IN A RATHER PECULIAR MANNER AND IS OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST.
