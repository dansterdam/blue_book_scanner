The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, consisting of a series of questions related to the observation of a UFO.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
No. The object did not disappear. It remained visible until it was lost from sight.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one): Yes         No         Don't Know.         IF you answered YES

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle one): Yes         No         Don't Know.         IF you answered YES

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - None.
b. Color - Metallic silver.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
This object would have been mostly covered by the match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing how you think the object may have appeared, its size, and especially note if it was rotating or appeared to be rotating. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
