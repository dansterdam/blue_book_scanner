There is no photograph present in the image. However, the image does contain handwritten text, which I will now transcribe:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 5th Nov 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Objects which were clearly defined lights or objects which flighted by moved. There were no airplanes or helicopters or the like flying by at the time/place, they looked as though they were the only objects in the sky. Suddenly, I noticed what seemed to be a large aircraft or balloon-like object hovering and circling the area, then blinking out completely. When it reappeared, it seemed to be lower and closer and then blacked out again. This happened several times and each time it seemed closer and lower.
I don't know what it was, this Shownee Parkway area, we not through seeing or hearing about similar experiences as others in the area had related.
By the time we saw the object it had got dark there would appear to be visible an overall glowing shape like an aeroplane silhouette outlined in light that would appear to grow larger and smaller (vary in size) and then vanish completely several times over a period of time
