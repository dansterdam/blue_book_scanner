The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a drawing of an unidentified object, with detailed descriptions and observations provided by the observer. The report form includes questions about the object's movement, appearance, and other characteristics.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object moved upward and then straight and disappeared.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.
It moved in front of a very hazy cloud.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - No unusual sound was heard.
b. Color - The color of the object was a very bright light.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note: how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
450 - 600

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The drawing shows an oblong, boomerang-shaped object with a trail or "plume" behind it, and the observer has noted details about its appearance and movement.
