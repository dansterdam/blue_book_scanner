Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star?-Now We Wonder
By Jim Jackson and Ivy Coffey 
of the State Staff

Stars, meteors and unusual atmospheric conditions were the order of the day in some sections of Oklahoma and nearby states during the early part of this week as citizens reported sightings of unidentified flying objects.

The lights were first reported over the state Monday of a rash of sightings that continued in Oklahoma City and other parts of the state and in Texas, Kansas and Missouri.

Officials in some Oklahoma communities, including Oklahoma City, were of the opinion that the lights may have been the familiar sightings of satellites and aircraft, tut others were not so easily satisfied.

The objects, sometimes described as star-like, sometimes as oval or elongated, were reported in Norman, Woodward, Guthrie, Oklahoma City and other parts of the state and in Texas.

The lights were reported over a period of several evenings starting last Monday, with sight-seeing and aircraft having been active in the skies over some sections.

In Guthrie, R.C. Knoch, an office furniture dealer, said the lights looked too large and too fast to be satellites and that they appeared to be grouped, flying in formation. He said they were "astronomical in nature."

The objects may have been the planets Jupiter and Venus as they were unusually bright this week, but the Air Force said it hasn't any information to confirm this. The Air Force contended the sightings were of normal celestial phenomena.

The term was described as a natural phenomenon, according to an Air Force statement.
