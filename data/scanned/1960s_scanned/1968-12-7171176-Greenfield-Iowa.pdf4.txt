The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with a series of questions and answer fields.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, How?
The handwritten answer indicates "No" and provides additional details about the object's behavior.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The response options "Yes" and "No" are circled, along with "Don't know" for the question.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The response options "Yes" and "No" are circled, along with "Don't know" for the question.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - "None"
b. Color - "A light yellow thing"

18. We want to get the angular size. Hold a match at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. In other words, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The handwritten response provides a detailed description of the object's size and coverage.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially outline or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The handwritten response includes a simple sketch labeled with an arrow.

About the size of a dime or smaller at arm's length.
