Text from the document:

Dear May I wanted to let you know that I called at the police station in regards to a U.F.O. siting I made for approximately 10 minutes on the night of November 8. I explained to the officer in charge that this siting was quite unusual and I wanted to report it, as I felt it may be of some value to your office. The object had a strange manner of movement and had appeared to me near Parwood and Norton. I have not yet heard from anyone so I wanted to follow up on this with you. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any further details from me. It would be appreciated if you could investigate this matter further. Thank you for your time.
