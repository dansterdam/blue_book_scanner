The image appears to contain an article or report from Project Blue Book, a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the mid-20th century. The report describes a UFO sighting by a deputy sheriff, referred to as "Deputy Called Star", who chased the object for over an hour. The report mentions that the Air Force said "radar indicates that no airborne objects were in the area at the time of the sighting", and that the object was brighter than any star in the sky. The report also mentions that a nearby police chief observed "two table saucers put together" at the same time. However, the report states that "photoanalysis of the negative indicates the bright light" that was photographed "does not appear as an image", and that "the two images which appear on the negative are probably the result of a preexisting defect due to old negatives and poor handling."

UFO SIGHTED
BY DEPUTY 
CALLED STAR

WASHINGTON (AP)--An unidentified object in the sky Deputy Sheriff Dale K. Spaur of Ravenna, Ohio, chased for an hour and a half last Sunday probably was the planet Venus, says the Air Force.

"Four air Force reports of 'somebody having control over' the object. But the Air Force said 'radar indicates that no airborne objects were in the area at the time of the sighting." Venus was rising in the southeast at that time. 

The same night, Police Chief Gerald Buchert of nearby Mantua, Ohio, said he took a photograph of two "flat saucers put together." 

The Air Force said 'photoanalysis of the negative indicates the bright light which he tried to photograph does not appear as an image." The two images which appear on the negative are probably the result of a preexisting defect due to old negatives and poor handling.'

Ohio and Pennsylvania reported seeing a brilliant and shiny object.

The Air Force did not comment on this.
