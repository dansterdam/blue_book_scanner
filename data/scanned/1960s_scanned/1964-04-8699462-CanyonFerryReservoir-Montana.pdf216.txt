St. Andrews family see UFO
From the Butte Evening Telegraph, April 16 '64:
"A strange object with a bright green and blue light was seen in the sky late last night by a St. Andrews family.
"Thomas Marshall, 35, of 1412 Lewis, Woodburn Place, said he and his family spotted the object while in their yard with the family's dog from Woodburn Place.
"'It started out,' he said, 'as a small silvery-grey cloud.' 'A light appeared in the center of it and started to move towards me. The light got brighter all the time as it came nearer and I could see 'yellow green and blue colors in it. There were about seven or eight.'"
"The shape changed and flattened as it got nearer from roughly circular to oval. It wavered, then suddenly went behind the house next door. The only thing was it didn't swing round or bank like an aeroplane does - it was just as if it went in." 
"Mr. Marshall saw the object reappear and go through the same performance before he reached home. He called out his wife and daughter and the three of them saw it for some more before it disappeared for good at 11:40."
