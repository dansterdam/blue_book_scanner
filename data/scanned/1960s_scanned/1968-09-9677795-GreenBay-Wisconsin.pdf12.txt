Sighted over a south western part this brilliant light. Just thought a was a North Central Airlines plane - later didn't see the flashing lights. I then watched as it moved to the west - my wife & I trying for some minutes to watch the phenomenon. It suddenly seemed to disappear from the face.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Just disappeared like the haze.

Q. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
ONLY TTHE TREE IN THE NE HORIZON
