The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. It contains a diagram and instructions related to observing and documenting UFO sightings. The diagram includes a compass rose and instructions for estimating the height of an observed object above the horizon based on its position in the sky. There is also a section where the observer is asked to draw the path of multiple objects if more than one was observed.

Transcription of text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

90°
75°
60°
45°
30°
15°
0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction along the course.

Left -----A-----> Right

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, then how many were there? CAh,1,1aa,, (4,. -2faa..,
