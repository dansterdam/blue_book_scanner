"Two Unidentified Etuning Observers in Bethel, Vermont, January 8, 1965.

Last night, January 8, 1965, Mr. Donald Smith and his wife, Mrs. Jean Smith, residents of Bethel, Vermont, observed two unidentified flying objects in the sky from their residence at the above address.

The first object was sighted at approximately 7:30 P.M. while the observers were watching television in their living room. They spotted a light through the window which appeared to be moving slowly from east to west at an estimated altitude of around 2000 feet. The object was described as round, reddish-orange in color, and pulsating.

After observing this object for a few minutes, another similar object was observed traveling in the same direction at a slightly higher altitude. This second object was also described as round, reddish-orange in color, and pulsating.

The two objects were in view for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before disappearing from sight. There were no sound effects associated with the objects. The observers stated that the objects appeared to be metallic in nature and were definitely not aircraft, satellites, or any other known type of aerial vehicle.

The observers, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, are reliable citizens of Bethel, Vermont, and this report is considered to be a credible sighting of two unidentified flying objects."
