SUMMARY OF EVENTS FOR PERIOD 23-30 APRIL 1963

During this period the only object of interest was a slow moving bright light observed on 25 April 1963 from approx. 2200 to 2230 hours. This object was first sighted in the W about 30 degrees above the horizon and moved slowly across the sky, disappearing in the ENE about 5 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be at an altitude of approx. 45 degrees at its highest point. The object was a steady bright light, somewhat larger than a star, and seemed to be self-luminous. No color, structure, or appendages were visible. It moved at a slow, steady pace, taking about 30 minutes to traverse the sky. No other objects were sighted during this period.
