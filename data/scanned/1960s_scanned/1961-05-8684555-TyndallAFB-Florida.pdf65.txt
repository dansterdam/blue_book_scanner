At approximately 2023 hours on 8 May 1961, the following report was received from the Control Tower at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida:

"While in the control tower, several personnel observed an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of Tyndall Air Force Base. The object was observed visually and on radar. The object was described as a bright, reddish-orange light, larger than a star, moving erratically at a high rate of speed. At times the object appeared to stop and hover, then accelerate rapidly and change directions. The object was under observation for approximately 15 minutes before disappearing from view."

In response to this report, no interceptor aircraft were scrambled since the object was not considered a threat to the base or aircraft in the area.
