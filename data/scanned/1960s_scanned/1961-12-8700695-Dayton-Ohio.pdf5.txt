The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with detailed celestial time information and observations related to the movement of the sun, moon, and planets.

Satellites runs fast, sometimes slow, but cause of the way the earth revolves around gives their motion irregular. As clocks come into use, "mean" time was introduced, which is based on the average speed of the earth's rotation.

At the beginning of November, mean time is about 15 minutes slow in relation to apparent time. After that - during December - the clock gains rapidly on the sundial. In mid-December the sun will be almost 15 minutes late.

The difference between mean and apparent time is called the "equation of time," it is the number of minutes and seconds that you must add to or subtract from the mean time indicated by the clock to get the correct apparent or sundial time.

On Dec. 6, approximately midway in the rapid gain of the equation of time, is 6 minutes 11 seconds. On Dec. 21, approximately midway to the least equation of time, is 3 minutes 17 seconds.

Sunset
Dec. 6 4:44 p.m.  
Jan. 6 4:49 p.m.

Sunrise 
Dec. 6 7:16 a.m.
Jan. 6 7:20 a.m.

Now the latest sunrise and the earliest sunset do not occur on the shortest day - but with the least time between the rising and setting.

In other words, the sun performs according to its own kind of time, not the artificial kind of time that man has found most convenient to regulate his activities.
