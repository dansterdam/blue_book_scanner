March 17, 67

Edwards Air Force. 
Gentlemen: 

My twin daughters are 17 years old. I were through our office frequently when something came over us. 

It looked like a ringlees plane: could have been as long as the 707, maybe longer. 

It was moving very low over the back. 

It moves slowly north West; our home is in the Verdugo Hills on the extreme South tip of the hills. 1720 Hillcrest.

Her car does not know anything used by civilians could not have maintained altitude at the slow speed it was moving.

I have tried many articles, Police Dept. Lockheed. So far no one seems to know anything stronger than coffee!  

Know what it was?

Sincerely
