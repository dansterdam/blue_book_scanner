The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force project to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Lt. Duncan was notified and contacted by the radio station owner and went with him to the landing site. He conducted a personal interview with the witness who was highly nervous. Photos of the legs and robot foot prints were taken, and these photos and other data is being forwarded with the report. Major Quintanilla requested Lt. Duncan to contact local police and forest rangers at the tower and advise him that information released to the press should be limited. Major Quintanilla asked if the holes had been measured as to distance between marks and depth of the holes and whether a Geiger counter check of the area had been made. Reply to both questions was negative. Since the investigation officer did not have a Geiger counter at his disposal.

The document also mentions a conversation with the PIO office at McDill on 9 Mar 65, and information that an aircraft was registered.
