Two young men driving toward Hudson Drive (5) noticed a blinking, large red light which appeared to be stationary and hovering above the ridgeline. No green or other lights were seen. The "craft" was moving diagonally (42 degrees) across the observers. When the "craft" was a short distance beyond (to the north), the red light flared brighter and the "craft" disappeared. No observers got out and scanned the sky with 7x50 binoculars, but the light was not seen again. The night was clear. No sound, no trail.
