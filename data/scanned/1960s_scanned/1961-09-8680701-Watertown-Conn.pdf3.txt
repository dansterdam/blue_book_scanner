On Friday, Sept 29, over Watertown, Conn, at about 3:00 o'clock, I sighted a spaceman or U.F.O., maneuvering over the scene field under the glare of the approaching evening. This may seem like a crazy and fantastic story to many, but it is the absolute truth. My name is deleted and I am an employee on the scene field under the U.S. Government. Only a few of the men were observing the scene, (they got a good look) and I received many a strange and queer look. At first one wondered at a very fast object, approximately over an acre in area, which was steady or even slightly moving from east to west (rising and then slowly taking a course to the north), then it seemed to increase speed and move to the east. I would appreciate your views on my strange sighting. I was greatly impressed by the performance. Thank you very much.
