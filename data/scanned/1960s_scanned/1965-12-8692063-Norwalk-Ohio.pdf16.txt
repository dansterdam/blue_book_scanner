December 1, 1965
Norwalk, Ohio

On the evening of December 1, 1965, I viewed a bright light in the sky. It appeared to be about 10 times the size of a star and it seemed to be moving slowly. It was three times the size of my son and he took his telescope outside to get a better look at it. At one point, it moved at a rapid pace, then seemed to circle around and come back. The light was quite bright and the wind was blowing from the northeast.

It hovered in one spot for quite some time and then suddenly, it shot straight up and disappeared. It moved down over the trees and then shot straight up and out of sight. It did not make any sound that I could hear.

My daughter, who is 13 years old, and also witnessed the object. She said it turned blue when I was on the inside of the circle calling out to her. She has never seen anything like it before.

I got the feeling it was trying to communicate with me. I shouted, "What do you want from me?", but it seemed to just disappear. I got the feeling it might have been some kind of aircraft, but I have never seen anything like it before and I don't know what it was.
