The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a detailed drawing or illustration showing a series of arrangements of celestial objects, likely to depict a UFO sighting. The drawing shows multiple small shapes arranged in different configurations.

The text in the document reads as follows:

IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE PHENOMENON, HOW MANY WERE THERE? DRAW A PICTURE TO SHOW HOW THEY WERE ARRANGED. DID THIS ARRANGEMENT CHANGE DURING THE SIGHTING?
There were 2 (phenomena)

CONDITIONS (CHECK APPROPRIATE BLOCKS)
SKY: OVERCAST, PARTLY CLOUDY, CLEAR, TWILIGHT, NIGHT
WEATHER: CUMULUS CLOUDS (FLUFFY), CIRROSTRATUS CLOUDS (HIGH HAZY), FOG OR MIST, HEAVY RAIN, LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE, HAIL, SNOW OR SLEET, UNKNOWN, NONE OF THE ABOVE
IF THE SIGHTING WAS AT TWILIGHT OR NIGHT, MOON: BRIGHT MOONLIGHT, MOON WITH HALO, MOON HIDDEN BY CLOUDS, PARTIAL OBSCURATION, NO MOONLIGHT, UNKNOWN

DURATION: (IN BACK OF YOU) / (TO YOUR LEFT) / (TO YOUR RIGHT) / (OVERHEAD) (NEAR MOON)
IN BACK OF YOU: STEADY SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS STREETLIGHT, HEADLIGHTS OR OTHER OBJECT IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW.

GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT REMAINED STEADY OR MOVED, OTHER DETAILS SUCH AS SHAPE, SIZE, DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT, MANNER OF DEPARTURE, AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU OBSERVED.
The phenomenon appeared to give off its own light. Throughout the entire occurrence I only noticed two colors, white and red. The objects seemed very solid and the edges were sharp. The phenomenon was a circular shape and the objects were various sizes. The only object I can compare it to would be a street lamp about half a block away from me. The smaller objects circled the bigger object. Then most of them came down and hovered over what looked like a small building. They projected a beam of light to the ground, and the beam went into the building. After that I could see them go straight up.
