The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a document with text and calculations related to a fireball sighting on July 24, 1967.

FIREBALL of 1967 July 24.69 G.M.T. 
This fireball is unique, so far as its duration is concerned, in that it appeared over the Atlantic
and its solution depends essentially. upon four displays. These were kindly sent to me by H. E. Roth, Project Director, Volunteer Flight Officer, N.C.A.A.P. United 
Airlines, Denver, Colo. It appeared at 16.30 G.M.T. The sighting details follow together with
some notes on the flight path and details of the fireball's duration.

837 16' 20" W. 53° N. 49' 30" N. 45° 20' 40.15 sec.
812 19' 31" W. 52° N. 53' 36" N. 79.10 sec.
821 18' 30" W. 51° N. 49' 30" N. 49.10 sec.
821 15' 0" W. 50° N. 46' 10' 20" N. 15.0 sec.

It is obvious that, as two longitude and three latitudes are given only to whole degrees,
accuracy cannot be assigned approximate. The duration was 6.5 2.7 sec. but is spread 
out in duration. The fireball was not seen seen over the Atlantic. It appeared approximately at sunrise at all stations. Sun report' rising at 815. Reported colors vary widely;
probably it was green when first seen.  At about 67 miles, the fireball's brightness, other
than terminal flares, was of the order of a bright half moon,  according to H. E. Roth
point 811, which was in most favorable position even of most distant, gives 5 to 19
times that of Venus. At night its essential magnitude may well have been as even 
lower. The absolute magnitude was roughly -7. (Gomes -6, Petrie -6.5, prepared.
The most probable solution seems to be as follows:

FIREBALL of 1967 July 24.69 G.M.T.
Began over A-11° 00' W. 53° 35' 47" N. at 87 1.49 km
Ended over A-10' 16' W. 53° 34' 37" N. at 81 2.29 km
Path length 39 km.
Radiant uncorrected a = 92°. d = 32° 
Radiant corrected a = 19°. d = 19°.

It is obvious that the solution is too approximate to warrant calculation of an orbit. 
In view of the very doubtful nature of the height, the conditions are too unique not to place this fireball on record.
