The object was quite brilliant and was seen by an auxiliary police officer (Thomas Hightower), who was riding with me, better than I could see it. It appeared larger than the full moon and was moving at a much greater speed than an airplane, reflecting flashes of light that were blinding at times. It was traveling in a north-easterly direction and was observed for several minutes before it disappeared from sight. It was not the usual airplane or satellite and after the object disappeared we could hardly believe what we had witnessed. The color of the object was a brilliant white with flashes of red and blue lights intermittently. After the object disappeared, we could still see a glow in the sky where it had been.
