TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

This day-biddr, 7 sept. 17 sup- SCIENTISTS RAN A SERIES OF
TESTS TO LOCATE A CHUNK OF JAGGAR'S METAL TO DETERMINE
CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND WEIGHT. THE METAL WAS LOCATED
IN THE RUBBLE -- ONLY 2 LBS IN WEIGHT. THE FIRST
CHEMICAL ANALYSIS INDICATED IT TO BE STAINLESS STEEL.
THE AMOUNT OF THE METAL RECOVERED WAS VERY SMALL
COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT REPORTED BY EYE WITNESSES TO BE
SEEN ON THE GROUND. IT IS TO BE PRESUMED THAT MOST OF
THE MATERIAL WAS VAPORIZED AT THE TIME OF LANDING.
EIGHT AIRFORCE PERSONEN AND FIVE CIVILIANS, INCLUDING
PHYSICISTS, AERODYNAMICISTS, METALLURGISTS AND CHEMISTS, 
MADE A CAREFUL VISUAL AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF THE
CRASH SITE AND THE METAL SAMPLES. OBSERVATIONS AND 
FIRST TESTS WERE MADE. FURTHER ANALYSIS AND STUDIES
ARE TO CONTINUE.
