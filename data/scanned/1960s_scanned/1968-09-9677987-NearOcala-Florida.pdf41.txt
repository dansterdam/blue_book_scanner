The information that we have received on your unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting is very interesting. However, the object there is different from ours. We would appreciate it if you would consider these factors: first, the object you describe is not what we have on record. We would need more specific information to make a proper evaluation. If you could provide us with a diagram and/or photographs, it would be most helpful. Please send any additional information you may have, and return this envelope.
