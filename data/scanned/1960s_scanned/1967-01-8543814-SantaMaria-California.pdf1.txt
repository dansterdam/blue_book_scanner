PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE-TIME GROUP: 27 JAN 67 23/0132
2. LOCATION: SANTA MARIA, CALIFORNIA
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: To the SE
8. PHOTOS: XX Yes
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: O Yes
10. CONCLUSION: The object appeared as an aircraft without running lights, but quite brighter. The lights appeared brighter than the brightest star. The lights were compared to the head-light of a truck, and were approximately one block or so. Only white lights were observed.

Photo examination revealed that the lights appeared only as circular light-colored images. The description is consistent with that of some type of aircraft engaged in aerial maneuvering. The photographs do not support such a probability.
