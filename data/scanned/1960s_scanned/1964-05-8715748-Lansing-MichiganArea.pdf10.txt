Whining Object in Sky Mystifies Lansing
LANSING - An unidentified flying object" traversed across Lansing early Thursday, setting nerves on edge and giving residents a spectacular show.
Don Weissett, 30, a television announcer in Jackson, first saw the object "while driving to Kalamazoo." He described it as "a great, silver-metallic thing."
Witnesses report to Lansing police that they saw the object and heard it "whining" and "screeching" as it moved across the sky. Many of the sightings were in an area near the Lansing Flying Club at the Lansing Capital City Airport.
A 12-year-old elephant named Zelia is on display at the zoo's Children's Corner, and police led the first caller) to the zoo, thinking that the "U.F.O." might be connected with that exhibit.
Elmer Eder, of 1008 W. Dunlap, Lansing, said, "I know it sounds crazy (but) I'd never seen the thing before in my place."
The object, Eder said, "It was pretty hot, too - a great, bright silver thing. All of a sudden, it disappeared, there was nothing."
State Police Sgt. Bert Hicks, of the Lansing post, said his wife, Barbara, "saw the object and said the way it came from the Lansing restaurant is gone."
The speed was terrific. Faster and faster it went until it disappeared in the east," the sergeant's wife said.
