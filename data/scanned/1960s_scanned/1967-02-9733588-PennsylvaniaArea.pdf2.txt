Dear Sirs:

I have seen something in the sky which I read on a magazine article was referred to as a U.F.O. Please do not expose it if the following report without first letting me know about that. I would greatly appreciate it if you can pass information on to the Wright-Patterson AFB on some Unusual Sightings I have done only right. I hope I have done right in sending this report because I was instructed by a friend to do so. I am sincerely sorry I need some of your valuable time.

Thank You.
Sincerely,
