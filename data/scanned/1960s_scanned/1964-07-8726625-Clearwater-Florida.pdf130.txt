July 6, 1964

Dear reporting, in regard to the case reported on July 4, 25 in Blue Book case No. 5 and remembered by my family as a recent happening. The sighting took place on July 2, 1964, about 10:15 PM near Clearwater, Florida. On that date, my wife and I were driving to the Beach area from Clearwater. When we reached a point about a mile or so east of the new Courtney Campbell Causeway, we noticed a strange light in the sky some distance ahead of us and slightly to the right. It seemed to be hovering or stationary and we watched it for a few minutes as we drove along. It was a bright white light, much brighter than the stars which were visible at the time. It appeared to be changing shape slightly, from round to oval and back again. After a few minutes, the light suddenly took off at a terrific speed, moving in a straight horizontal line, and disappeared from sight in about 2 or 3 seconds. This was the only strange thing we observed that evening. The weather was clear and there was no wind. We thought at first it might be a satellite, but the speed with which it disappeared indicated it was not. We are reporting this sighting since it seems to meet the criteria for Project Blue Book. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
