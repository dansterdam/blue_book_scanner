UFO Report
This is a report of a call from the 4th of August 1965 case of Mrs. and Mr. witnesses. There was a mix-up here. 
One object they saw in the west seems most likely to have been Venus - it was stationary. A few nights later they saw Echo, but the primary sighting remains unexclined. Here or the witnesses, that is, Mr. and Mrs. 
is exactly a bright light, but I got most from Mrs. They generally agreed on the fact that they were facing northward one evening, shortly after dark, and shortly overhead they say a very bright light, very much brighter than any other star, which moved erratically, Went out, came back to the site, moved, stopped, grew brighter when it stopped, and kept this sort of thing up for about 15 minutes, spending its very slowly from nearly overhead to about "6 inches off the end of the moon". This establishes the fact that it made an appreciable arc across the sky, and hence rules out a twinkling star. It does not mile cut a balloon, I said below. The identity of the object remained the same because she said they watched it the whole time. She said it would move, then stop, turn brighter, then move again. It was the color of other stars, rather bluish white. 
Because a police officer came to their apartment saying that some young girl had reported it. The police officers apparently got there too late to see anything. However, they said that they had had reports from all over the city about the strange object. The case is sufficiently interesting to send the 164 Forms to them, and I am so doing - several of them, so Mrs. can get the neighbors to fill them out also.
