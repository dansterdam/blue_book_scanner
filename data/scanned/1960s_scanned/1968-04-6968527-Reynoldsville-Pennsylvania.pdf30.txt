AFR 80-17(C1)
1. STOP A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE ANY LAST, ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS INDISTINCT OR IRREGULAR, AND INDICATE CLEARLY BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

PAST EXPERIENCES HAVE SHOWN THAT A SNAP OR PRESS SHUTTER WILL OFTEN FAIL TO SHOW A DEFINITE OBJECT, SUCH AS A SPHERE OR DISC, WHEN WHAT APPEARS TO THE OBSERVER AS A DISTINCT OBJECT, MERELY APPEARS AS BLURRED OR INDISTICT FORMS ON THE FILM. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE PERSON TAKING THE PICTURE MOVE THE CAMERA SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AS CLEAR A DELINEATION AS POSSIBLE.
