ATTN OF: TDXL

2 DEC 1963

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

1. HQ USAF SAR-OFFR (Mrs. Salivar)

2. Forwards the attached letter from dated 14 Nov 63, requesting information on unidentified flying objects.

a. The report indicates a sighting was made - the objects without extra lights are quite numerous, also, the objects are consistent with a nuclear vehicle hovering above the surface of a lake or the ocean.

b. All satellite decays have an easterly component, i.e. the objects were not satellites.

c. Decay is characteristic by a breaking up of the object and its slower descent or ascent.

d. The duration is much greater than a meteor sighting. For example, sightings of Spanish IV satellite in excess of two minutes. The Apollo re-entry decay in 1962 was observed from Florida to Maine and lasted in excess of 5 minutes.

e. In a case summary of the 1 Aug 1963 sighting in Fairfield, Illinois it was noted that the sighting could not be satisfactorily explained.

f. At no time did the Air Force attempt to discourage Mrs. regarding this sighting. However, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons for our evaluation of the sightings. Normally, established criteria and/or observations preclude any other explanation.

g. There are many reasons for static on a radar set, for example: electrical disturbances, temperature inversions, or ground returns from mountains and buildings. No association was established between the UFO and static in this case.

h. The Air Force has no information regarding a "settling instant" in relation to this case.
