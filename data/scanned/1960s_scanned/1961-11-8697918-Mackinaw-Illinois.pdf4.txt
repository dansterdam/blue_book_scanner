There does not appear to be a photograph present in this page from the old UFO report document. The text describes the witness's account of seeing a low-flying plane with a row of square lights, which then proceeded to move silently and disappear from view. The text does not mention or describe any specific photograph.

WHO lives approximately 3 or 4 miles from the field. On that night of November 20, at some undetermined time, but definitely prior to 11 o'clock, and most probably between 10 and 10:30, ********* has been coming back from town and as he walked into his farmhouse, he looked up and saw what he took to be a low-flying plane with a row square lights like compartment windows. He associated no noise with the sighting. He walked unhurriedly into the house and called to his wife to ask whether she-'would care to see a flying saucer. They both looked out the kitchen window (and I did too later) and saw this object proceeding at a vague clip, actually no observer but he has a disarming honesty about his vagueness. He just didn't know anything other than he had seen some lights, a low-flying craft aircraft, and no noise and he wasn't even sure of directions until I had to identify them for him. As close as we can get, the craft was moving from south to north, and disappeared from his view in his northwest quadrant. His comment is a paragon of negative curiosity and a good 20 minutes' questioning yielded only a few crumbs, but well-repeated crumbs, of basic information.

Bidding good-bye to ********* shortly thereafter to *********** and I proceeded back to the headquarters of the *********** and I thereupon the Captain and Sam to have lunch with me at the nursery. After luncheon I did both those courtesies good-bye and reported in to the ticket desk only to find that my flight had been cancelled and that the next one left some four hours later. I retired to the nursery to sleep. I have now awakened from my nap and this is being dictated in the nursery of the greater Peoria airport. It is yet one and a half hours to flight time.

Suggested solutions: During the entire course of interrogation, two things kept coming to mind: One is that the white lights originally described so closely with landing light ends; Second, that the close cluster of lights likewise tallied with the sighting of my own about 1950 from the balcony of the Perkins Observatory. There I had turned a 8-inch telescope on to the apparition and studied the arrangement of lights quite closely. There were some 3 lights arranged in a cluster formation that somehow reminded me of a small Christmas tree making a stately cruise of the sky. This later turned out to be, after a good deal of puzzling and a gross many no's and denials that anybody knew anything, to be a KC-97 tanker. A tanker of this sort has, I understand, a large boom light and numerous running lights scattered over its vast expanse.
