To whom it may concern:
On the evening of March 23,1966, Between the hours of 8:00, and 9:00 P.M., I was called out of my home to see some sort of an object which was in the sky. At the moment I first saw this object it was no higher than a home. It traveled in the form of a figure 8. This object had a flickering light, when approaching it appeared to be very bright, seemed to grow dim and then bright again, this appearance and disappearance was erratic, sudden. When the object had been in this direction for awhile, and the object had disappeared, somewhere. When the object had been observed, a flickering off, and then on.
When first seeing the object with a naked eye, it had appeared to have hundreds of blue-green flashing lights. As it approached nearer it seemed to be a circular object, with a pair of bright lights, and could not see these points any more. I did not have a camera to know positively what I had seen, so I have made a sketch of the way this object had looked to my eyes. My eyes are in perfect condition, and I know that I did not see anything that was not there. So we agreed this is what I would go away from the plane. Perhaps someone is trying to reach us or we are trying to reach the moon. We may be able to find the solution to this some day-if this object ever lands in our yard I will contact you. I would certainly would like to know what this is, as thousands of others would. This does not frighten me in the least. Perhaps it could be MARS.
I am employed and certainly am not CRAZY:
