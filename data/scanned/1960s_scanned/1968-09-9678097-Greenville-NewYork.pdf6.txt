The text in the document reads:

It was at about 11:30 p.m. Times of sircus, I made a sighted object, as you are aware, it was parked on the parking lot and seemed not to move on. After I saw it, it was the size of a small plane and seemed to have lights all around it. As the people who have seen, one of them had already called the police, and I have the license plate number my friend went to the spot.

I looked around for a sighting that I missed, but the thing is disapppeared. I have the showing home with my self in 30 minutes.

I have the showing home with my self in 30 minutes. Sincerely yours,
