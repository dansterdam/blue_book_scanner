GROUP # 2
Mr. Hiram Mercross
Rowley, Mass. 337-2305

On October 3rd I interviewed Mr. Hiram Mercross at his home in Rowley, Mass. Mr. Mercross observed an unidentified object on the evening of Oct. 2, 1967 at approximately 8:40 PM. He was standing outside his home when he observed a bright object moving toward him rapidly from the south and then suddenly stopped approximately 150-200 yards away and remained hovering about 50-75 feet off the ground. The object appeared to be oval-shaped and was giving off a brilliant white glow. It hovered there for approximately 30 seconds and then raced away to the north at a terrific speed, disappearing from sight in about 3-4 seconds. Mr. Mercross was quite upset by the incident and stated that he could see no windows, lights, or any other identifying features on the object. It just appeared as a glowing oval-shaped craft. The distance was such that he could clearly make out the details of the object.

Parrella E. Lombardo

By the time I had interviewed Mr. Lombardo, he said that he had read accounts of the incident involving Mr. Mercross and that he had experienced a similar sighting on the same evening at approximately 8:40 PM. He said that the object appeared to be oval-shaped, giving off a brilliant white glow, and that it hovered for about 30 seconds before speeding off to the north.
