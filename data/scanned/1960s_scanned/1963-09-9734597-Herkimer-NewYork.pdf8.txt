September Aurora Sequel

Several photographs of the northern skies, taken to record the continuation of the auroral display over Herkimer, New York, on 9 September 1963. The photographs were taken from about 9:25 p.m. Eastern standard time. The display is shown in two distinctive areas in the picture. Bands of white light, typical of auroral forms, can be seen against the darker night sky.
