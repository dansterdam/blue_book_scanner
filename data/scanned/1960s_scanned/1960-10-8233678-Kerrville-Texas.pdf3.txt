The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, specifically a letter dated November 8, 1960.

The text in the document is as follows:

4 November 1960

Dear Mr.

The unidentified flying object observed on or about 7 October 1960 has been thoroughly investigated and evaluated by this headquarters.

Your letter contained insufficient information for a valid analysis. Specifically, we do not have the exact time, location, duration and description of the sighting which would be required for a detailed investigation and evaluation.

From the little information given, it is believed the object viewed was possibly a meteor or other celestial phenomenon.

Sincerely,

EDWARD J. RUPPELT
Lt Colonel, USAF
Office of Information
