The text in the handwritten section states:

"I was sitting in the living room watching TV when I noticed the object in the sky. It was larger than usual star and had a reddish orange color to it. It moved across the sky and then seemed to stop and hover over a railroad track for a few minutes. The object then moved away very rapidly toward the horizon. This all occurred between 8:30 and 9:00 pm on the evening of October 8, 1965."
