could be expected if there were another intelligent civilization within our own solar system, but at the present time there is no evidence for the existence of such a civilization on Mars or on any other nearby planet.

Related to the UFO report is the contact tale, a contemporary report of the landing of an extraterrestrial space vehicle on Earth. Unlike the UFO descriptions, these tales display a striking uniformity. The extraterrestrials are described as humanoid, differing from us only in some small characteristic such as teeth, speech, or dress. The aliens -- so the "contactees" report -- have been observing Earth and its inhabitants for many years, and express concern at "the present grave political situation." They are fearful that, left to our own devices, we will destroy our civilization. The contactee is then selected as their "chosen intermediary" with the governments and inhabitants of Earth (The contactee's qualifications for this position are not always evident.). He is taken on voyages in the spacecraft, sometimes to the visitors' home planets, but somehow the promised political or social intervention never materializes.
C. G. Jung has pointed out that the frequency and persistence of these contact tales -- not one of which has been confirmed by the slightest objective evidence -- must be of considerable psychological significance.
