TDPT/UFO Maj R Quintanilla, Jr./70216/lab/29 Dec 67
UFO Observation, 14 September 1967

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of unidentified flying
object reports from the Indiana area which occurred on 14 September
1967 between 3:40 am and 4:15 am.

2. The reports contain accounts of two different sightings, at approximately
3:40 am a bright white object that was trailing sparks and flames,
was observed traveling from north to southwest to northeast. At 4:12 am
another object was observed traveling from the southwest to the
northeast. The white object was also trailing flames, but the flames
were observed in a more distinct manner. The object was observed for
two to three minutes each and were witnessed by several aircraft crew members
near Indianapolis one ground observer in Gary, Indiana.

3. These observations appear similar to that of a satellite decay
and for this reason we would like additional information on any
atmospheric conditions on the date of the sightings. Request
information be forwarded to your agency on our findings.

4. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.
