The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document. It does not contain any photographs, but rather shows an "Air Letter" or airmail envelope with some text. The text on the envelope indicates that "AN AIR LETTER SHOULD NOT CONTAIN ANY ENCLOSURE IF IT DOES IT WILL BE SENT BY ORDINARY MAIL."

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the output of all the text found in the document:
