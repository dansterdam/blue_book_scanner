The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or form with questions about the observers' experience with an unidentified object, such as whether the object disappeared while being watched, whether it moved behind or in front of something, and details about its appearance and behavior.

Here is the text from the document, produced as an OCR output:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color
c. Size

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially what trails or vapor trails, if any, the object left.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
