1st Ind (CT-DAl)
TO: TD-53 (Major Friend)

1. The examination of the film has produced these findings:
a. In addition to the bright circular image, a similar separate faint image also appears in most frames. This is the only uniform. These images change position within the frame in a uniform manner while remaining the same relative size.
b. The background also changes position within the frame but is a different rate.

2. Analysis of the report reveals the following:
a. The sun was very high and slightly off the direction of flight.
b. The camera was aimed to the left and in a downward manner.
c. The only explanation was can offer is that the images were reflections on a light window. This would account for the position changes on a double pane window.
