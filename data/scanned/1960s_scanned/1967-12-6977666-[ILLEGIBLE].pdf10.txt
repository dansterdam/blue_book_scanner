This case concerns a civilian who was requested to come to a military base. The informant states that he was driving and saw two blue lights in the sky. One object started to move very rapidly and disappeared. The other object stayed in the same area and seemed to be flashing lights. The informant could not determine the speed, size, or distance of the object.
