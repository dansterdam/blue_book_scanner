The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document, likely a UFO report, with handwritten text.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 5/15/66

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. Saw and saw a large paper bag. Only if fast (text cut off)
