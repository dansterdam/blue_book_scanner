An 11:45-September 15th, 1962 SAUCER LAPPED IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY: An important SAUGER LAPPED over Oradell, New Jersey, (a town about 15 miles northwest of New York City) at 7:45 p.m. Saturday Sept. 15th, according to reports from eyewitnesses.

J.L.U., 72 years, reported that he had a clear view of the entire affair. He called for his wife to witness the object along with the next door neighbor's son.

They had seen it descending slowly, making a complete circle over the water, submerged for a few seconds, and then rose vertically over the water. It then re-appeared on the other side of the reservoir and shot across the reservoir in a horizontal position maintaining about the same altitude, and with no sound. To corroborate matters still further, large banana-shaped craft, estimated to be 200 feet long, several of them were sighted over the reservoir area, and the police then barricaded the land from the public.

The next day, Sunday Sept. 16th, the police again barricaded the area.
