Request for UFO Information

1. It could be a hoax: 
Lyvern College Observatory
60 Martin Street
Cambrige, Massachusetts 02139

2. Reference your letter of 15 July 1963. Please excuse the delay in reply.

3. We have forwarded a copy of the 3 February 1967 listing from our project Blue Book files. This also includes material received since the date. 

4. Inclosures: In view of our evaluation card for a sighting from Blachly, Alaska, where one of the four observers were aircraft personnel, we think the "report" was slight to suspect.

6. We also have a very interesting case for the late evening of 25 Sept. 1956. The observers (apparently were very capable and reliable people) sighted a large delta-wing aircraft hovering and then silently disappearing. They left no doubt of their conviction that the object was not an aircraft. However, the object did not show on the moon but did see a star.

5. Incidentally, we do not know anything about the decay or any similar unusual case indians in late June or early July 1956. There was simply nothing to our knowledge that was unusual in our records for that period.
