The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record, which is a report from the United States Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects. The text on the image provides details about an observation made on March 29, 1967 in Corvallis, Oregon. The observer saw an "astro(naut)" object that was on an azimuth of 164 degrees at an elevation of 30 degrees. The observer was putting a dog out when the object was observed. The description notes that the object did not disappear, but was still visible when the observer quit looking. The document concludes that the description is consistent with an astronomical observation, and that an object like this would have been the brightest object in the southern sky during that time.

4. NATURE OF OBJECTS: Astro(naut)
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Visual
7. COURSE: Stationary
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: The description is consistent with an astronomical observation. Such an object would have been the brightest object in the southern sky at this time of the year.
