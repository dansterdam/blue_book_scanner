THE SKY WAS EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR AND THE MOON WAS ABOUT HALF FULL AND EXTREMELY BRIGHT.
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT SOME 50 PEOPLE WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCE. IHE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE SAUCER-SHAPED, ABOUT 50-60 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND FROM A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 1 1/2 MILES IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 15-20 FEET OFF THE GROUND. IT MOVED AT CONTROLLED SPEED OVER A SMALL AREA, ROTATING AS IT DID SO AND EMITTING A BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT OF VARYING INTENSITY FROM ITS UNDERSIDE. THE OBJECT ALSO EMED INTERMITTENT BURSTS OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE SMOICE OR ETEAM FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF ITS PERIPHERY, POSSIBLY FOR PROPULSION OR CONTROL PURPOSES. AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES OP OBSERVATION, THE OBJECT SIMPLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR AT TREMENDOUS SPEED, DISAPPEARING FROM SIGHT IN A FEW SECONDS.
SEVERAL OBSERVERS CLAIMED TO HAVE OBSERVED THROUGH BINOCULARS THAT THE UFO WAS CONSTRUCTED OP A METALLIC MATERIAL.
THIS SIGHTING WAS INVESTIGATED ON THE SAME DAY BY PERSONNEL FROM THE 4602ND AIR INTELLIGENCE SQUADRON (AIS). ACCORDING TO THE BEPORT, WEATHER AND AIRCRAFT CHECKS PROVED NEGATIVE AND NO SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION FOR THIS SIGHTING COULD BE FOUND.
