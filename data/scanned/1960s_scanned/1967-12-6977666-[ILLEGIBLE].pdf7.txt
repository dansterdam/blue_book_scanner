Dear Sir,

I would like to report a sighting of a U.F.O. over Staten Island on the night of Friday, December 1. I am speaking for my club of which most of them saw this object. We (the club) were on the roof of the local Y.M.C.A. having a viewing session (our club is basically an astronomy club for younger boys) when 1 of the elder boys called to my attention an object over Staten Island much brighter than a star and 4 times as big, the color was an orange-red and it was in the shape of an circle. The object came from behind a church steeple and headed directly for us, then it made a 90 degree turn to the north. Then it headed straight on and disappeared in a group of smoke-stacks. Several people saw this including myself, and one of the boys saw this thru a telescope but lost it because of its rate of travel. We verify this to be the truth to the best of our knowledge and there is a diagram on the bottom of this page to show the path taken.

We would appreciate any help you can give us on our observations.
