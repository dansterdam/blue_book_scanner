57 Lady Volunteers Lauded For Hospital Red Cross Service
Closing and recognition ceremonies for Red Cross volunteers in the TRACY Hospital Tacoma were recently held. 36 women received honor certificates and 36 ware presented with service pins for the completion of their training period. Among those honored were five members of the Lakewood Elks Lodge, Mrs. John W. Humphrey, Mrs. Frederick E. Breen, Mrs. James A. Doke, Mrs. John W. Wilcox and Mrs. Paul Rapp.

VA Child Benefit Acts Available
The VA administra-tion has pointed out that many children and their parents are unaware of the beneficial provisions available under the VA children's program. These include vocational and educational assistance, compensation payments, and other benefits. While the general public may be familiar with VA compensation and pension pay-ments, the more comprehensive children's program services are not so widely known.

The VA says it will be glad to spell out the particulars of this program to any child or parent who wishes to inquire about it. Regardless of whether a veteran is living or deceased, his children may have earned the right to many allowances and services.
