That's hard to say too. It shouldn't have been over 5 minutes though. What would have happened if the total time had been longer than that occasion? The total of the time--Well actually these other people had it spotted with binoculars and 2 probably only saw it for a minute or two and the second time for a minute or maybe more than that. Were you watching it when it disappeared? No, I wasn't. I was talking on the Unicom I believe. About what time was this? Do you recall? I don't know the time. I should have, I should have looked at my watch--but I didn't. You should be able to get it from one of these other--with regard to another, was there any cloud cover? No, it was clear but it was slightly hazy. The mountains were in the haze but this was in my estimations, a very reliable object. I don't believe it was a weather balloon. OK, I think that will do it. And thanks very much.

Would you give your name and address, sir? My name is * * * * * * * * * * *, Salt Lake City, Utah. What is your occupation? I'm an operator of * * * * *. And how long have you been in this business? I've been in this business a couple of years at this location. How long have you been a pilot? Twenty years. About how much flying time do you have? Probably close to 2000 hours. Did you notice any definite shape to this object? No, I wasn't able to see a definite shape. What did it appear to you like? I could see the object with my naked eye--the glow of it and through the binoculars I could see that it was just a bright shiny object.
