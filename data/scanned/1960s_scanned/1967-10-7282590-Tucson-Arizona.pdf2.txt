Site Information
a. These Laboratories have on file numerous Corps of Engineers Condition Survey or Airfield Pavement Evaluation reports which describe details of soil and geological conditions, terrain, and drainage. Information in these reports primarily relates to the airfield, general observations of soil and climatic conditions apply to the location of the UFO observance.

b. The climate in the area is generally arid. Rainfall is the fall-months averages about 0.75 inches per month. Free ground water is rarely found at depths less than 200 feet.

c. The natural subgrade soils in the area consist mainly of sand (SC-SM), gravel (GP), and sandy clay (CL) in various proportions with an appreciable filling of lime carbonate. Sandy clays occur in many areas to depths of at least six feet, and existing materials, ranging from a loose to medium dense condition, are of common occurrence at depths varying from three to six feet.
