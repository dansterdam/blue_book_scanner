S: Well, I looked at it for just about a half an hour, and when I left it was still there.
It was still there.
S: Yes, sir. I had to go to the station at 12:00. I picked it up at 11:30 - got a call on it, and when I came into the station at 12:00 it was still there.
H: Did you ever investigate the people who called in?
S: Yes, sir. I spoke to them since then and I'd spoken to them before that about other things, of course.
H: What kind of people are they, if I may ask?
S: Well, it's difficult to say. I would say that the husband - he's a banker - I don't think he would be really a dependable person but his wife I think would be.
H: Well, O K, I get the message. It is very difficult to find people who can intelligently describe something like this, because, well - they just are not used to it - for one thing. Now, let me see if there is anything -- did you have any feeling - well, it's probably funny for me to say so -- but I think if I were watching something like that I might feel a little frightened or wondering if someone was there watching me, or something.
S: This is what I had. I was amazed more than anything, but I did have that feeling.
H: I'm a little surprised that you didn't get more people to watch it with you.
S: Oh, there was about five or six people where I was.
H: Oh, there were.
S: Yes, sir.
H: Do you have the names of any of them?
