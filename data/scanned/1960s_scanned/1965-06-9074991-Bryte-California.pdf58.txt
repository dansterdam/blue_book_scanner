SAUCER PHOTOGRAPHED IN PENNSYLVANIA. The picture above is one of three found in a report by Walter Webber. The picture was taken on May 5th, which was more than a month before the "fighting" saucer was publicized. For some unfathomable reason the Air Force has kept it quiet until now. The object is apparently revolving or spinning, and a vaper trail of some sort behind the object, and it is showing concentric circles in its center. The tech-aspect is unexplained. Witnessed by more than one. The investigator adds that he would like the Air Force to investigate the incident, but as yet he has not been questioned.
