BATTLEFIELD LIGHTS BEING TESTED
Not Saucers, Just Lit-Up Planes
U. that little airplane carrying a lighted ad-
vertising display on a pear of big, glowing-in-
the-dark panels last week, the UFO experts had better
Lone themselves "seatching" for other explanations.

An airplane carrying a battery of high-intensity
floodlights is expected to provide a much better per-
formance than a half-moon on the Air Force base,
possibly around 9:30 p.m., with all lights blazing.

The C-130 HERCULES is equipped with 38
special-lights and reflectors for lighting bat-
tlefield areas, such as those in Vietnam.

It is coming to VPAFE for flight tests from
Greenville, Tex., where the lights were installed
by Lt. Gen. Delmar Wilson.

"It's a startling sight," one Aeronautical Sys-
tems Division official saidâ€”"AT 5,000 or 7,000 feet
altitude, the lights can make it merely a giant
firefly."

CALLED BIAS

The lights, mounted in pods on the forward
part of the C-130, may replace the outmoded flare
packs now used to light war zones.

FLYING AT 5,000 feet, the plane can illuminate
an area about a mile in diameter at 2U times
the brightness of full moonlight.

Project officer for BIAS is Maj. William S. 
Paul of TILD Mobility Dr.
The Air Force in 1956 tested an earlier version
of Battlefield Flares mounted in the belly of
a C-13U Provider transport.
