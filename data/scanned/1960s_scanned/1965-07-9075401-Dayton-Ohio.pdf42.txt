Text from the document:

Mrs. --------- of Dayton, Ohio called on
13 Jul 65 regarding a UFO observation by her and her neighbor.
She was quite confused as to direction, description etc.
It was a silver ring, little white cloud, then it burst into two
objects. Her husband could not see object and wouldn't believe
her. It was either 11 or 12 Jul 65 when she observed object.
Object also had points like a star, then went up and X went
NW, two came out of cloud, shaped like points, then there were two
round objects and dangled around. She saw more than two objects.
Since she was confused Sgt Moody suggested that she fill out an
FTD Form 165. This is agreeable. Form was sent to her on 13 Jul 65.
