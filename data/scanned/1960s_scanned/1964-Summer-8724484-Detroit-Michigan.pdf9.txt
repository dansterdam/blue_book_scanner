"Information Only SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS Committee Review, Vol. 4, No. 2, Sep 64 PLACE: Parma, Ohio
DATE: 5 June 1964

"At about 11:30PM on this date, a group of college students, in the early hours of the morning, observed a flying object which they said maneuvered in the air above them. They said the object seemed to explode several times and their compass moved as it approached them. They further stated they were terrified by the experience and as the object left the area, they heard a low humming sound.

Committee Review: In the above incident, the several college students observed an unidentified flying object which exhibited some unusual characteristics. Their report, while containing some details, lacks sufficient specific information to permit a definite evaluation or explanation. The incident is being retained for further study and analysis as part of the overall UFO program."
