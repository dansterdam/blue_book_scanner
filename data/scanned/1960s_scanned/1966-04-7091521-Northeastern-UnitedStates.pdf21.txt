1700 hrs  13 May 1966
Malden, Massachusetts
Two unidentified flying objects were first observed by a number of witnesses between the hours of 1700 and 1745, and then at about 1800.20:00 hours? unidentified flying object. The object was described as being bright and circular, apparently about 25-30 feet in diameter. It was observed to be hovering, and then to move away very rapidly to the south.
First all calls were taken and recorded at the time. An emergency scramble of jet aircraft from Otis AFB near Hyannis was ordered by the ADC command. As determined from the tape recordings, these calls were received from many persons, both civilian and military, reporting the sighting of the unidentified flying object. These various observers gave detailed information as to what they had seen. It also appears that there were telephone calls to Hanscom Field concerning the sighting.
By the time I was able to contact Col Moore, who was in command of the ADC detachment at Otis AFB, the jets were already airborne. He informed me that they had chased the object but had been unable to intercept it, as it had moved away at a very high rate of speed. He stated that the pilots had obtained a visual sighting of the object and that, at one point, it had hovered for a period of time before suddenly accelerating and moving out of sight. At the same time, it was picked up on radar. I was informed that the object did not remain in the area long, but left rapidly in a southerly direction.
I would state that an official information release has been made, and that all telephone calls and reports have been carefully recorded. This is merely a brief summary of the highlights of this sighting, and the official files should be consulted for complete details.
