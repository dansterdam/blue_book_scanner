The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page of text from a document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Here are some other factors about the situation that are strange to me:

(1) If the white spot is the result of lack of development, this would indicate a lack of the chemical on the edges (or on the negative). 

(2) Instead of being clearly defined around the edges, the chemical has been scattered around the edges, as might be expected in the photograph of an object to use a flying saucer.

(3) I have taken and developed thousands of pictures, but I have never seen anything like this on any of them. It does appear was taken in an area in which flying saucers have been reported, and that it appears to be a shot of a building or structure with an object to use a flying saucer.

The object still indent shown in this picture is of some object and was condensed during development, but because of the insertion in your picture it is hard to determine what the object was. Please let me know and I will send it to you.

Sincerely,
