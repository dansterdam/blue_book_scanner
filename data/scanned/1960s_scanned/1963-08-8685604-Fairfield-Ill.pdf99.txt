The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report from Project Blue Book, likely describing a UFO sighting.

"There are non-earth people visiting here and I know these and have seen them", Mr. Owen told the Press. 

On a Wednesday evening, around nine o'clock, Deputy Lee observed a lighted object, four to five times the size of a star, coming from the north. The object slowed down and hovered a bit, then took off at a very high rate of speed. At one point it was about 15 degrees above the horizon. This was about 9 p.m. 

According to the report, a Miss Sarah Pemble called the Sheriff's office to report she had seen "a strange lighted object" that flew over a field near her home. Two other persons, not named, also saw the object. 

The report states that Key Bock said he would pay $1,000 for a tape recording of the sighting made by Deputy Lee. The report also mentions several churches in the area that have observed "strange lights in the sky" that may be related to UFOs.

The document concludes by discussing the possibility that present-day troubles may be involved with the appearance of UFOs and that the situation requires serious study and investigation.
