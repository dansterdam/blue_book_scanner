Dear Sir:
This letter is being written at the suggestion, and with the approval, of Major William H. Gammon, 0-345, for information concerned with an incident which occurred on May 23, 1961.

Before reporting observed object wish to point out that writer did not see object but received information from witnesses.

Tuesday, May 23, 1961, observed a fast moving object, brilliantly lighted, approaching from a southwesterly direction and disappearing in an area of Plover Watch Company, 75-20 Astoria Boulevard, Jackson Heights, who may have had better observation.

The sighting was brief, clearly visible, definitely not an aircraft. It seemed to be an elongated object, rapidly moving, luminous in color, approximately 1/2 the size of a full moon.

Felt it was an optical illusion to verify assumption based on present knowledge.
