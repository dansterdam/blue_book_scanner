The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text that appears to be part of a report or document. The text describes a person's experience of observing a strange moving object, noting that it seemed to be glittering and that the person could not estimate its rate of speed. The text also mentions that the object was "really fast" and that the person was unable to determine what it was.

Text transcribed from the image:

mile did stare, and I don't know
how high (as I have had no ex-
perience in measuring this kind of
distance). It seemed to be glittering.
The object was moving slightly
swifter than a plane, altho I think
a plane could have caught up &
it if it were a really fast one.
It glowed. That is, it glowed.
I can't estimate the rate per minute.
(Somewhere around 80 times, I think)
I don't know whether it made any
noise or not, because it was
avingly last night and 8:30 not
yet used to the normal background
