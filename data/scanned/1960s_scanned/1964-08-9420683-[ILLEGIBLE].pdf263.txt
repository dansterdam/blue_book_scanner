The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that includes handwritten text.

Transcribed text from the document:

P.S. I have come across your original request for an examination of the Highland Park, New Jersey case. It seems you are still interested in the ghost-guided cases which show up with any case, as I knew they would be.

Possibly saw the two beacons and a very faint 'glow.' Note that there were no other lights in the vicinity and that is just about as close as I can get to other lights.

Dear Sir,

I have been having many flying saucer sightings recently. The nature of these sightings seems to have been changed as the result of your papers and, as usual, you asked me to write in my own words on what I saw.
