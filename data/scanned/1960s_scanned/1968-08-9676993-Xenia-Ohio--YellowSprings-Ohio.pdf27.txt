It really actually appeared to move.
Hynek: Appeared to move crossways? 
It had a movement that no moon ever had. This was what attracted us and made us watch it.
Hynek: Well, the moon was never very high at that time, certainly, quite low in the horizon and if you say it fizzed up, well then obviously couldn't have been the moon.
I really studied it. But at first glance, I got there just a man who had turned to look at us in rather a peculiar way. But then we saw it doing this.
Well, the moon never acted like that. Then we watched it and it was doing this movement.
Hynek: Can you recall some of the conversation you had during the time you were actually watching it? What did you say to each other?
That's kind of hard to remember. 
Hynek: Is Mr. Harold Fogg there - is he the one that works at Wright Field - could I talk with him - that is your feeling about this whole thing (to ______)
I don't believe what I saw and then what was explained to me by the other people. I really don't believe that there is a system of any sort that can operate, at least that I know of, with this kind of capacity. What else is there?
Major, I just wanted to get your viewpoint on this since you're - what is your field?
I'm majoring in aerospace engineering, and it's a field I've worked in. I analyze structures which does some design work on existing systems and I've worked in propulsion and I've worked in advanced design.
Hynek: How would you then, in more technical terms, describe the kinematics of this object as you saw it?
As I say, which was very vague compared to everyone else, I really couldn't give you any more than what they had explained to you; I could only use their terminology. 
Hynek: You mean by the time you got out there, it was mostly gone?
