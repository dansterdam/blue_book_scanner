The report states that the objects were about 50 to 70 degrees from where the witness stood, and that they were about twice as bright as a star.

Flying Saucer Report
While walking down College Avenue after visiting a friend on the night of November 5, 1955, I looked up and to my surprise I saw two strange objects in the sky. At first, I thought that they were stars, but then I noticed that they were moving, and they were much larger than stars. They moved at a tremendous speed, first one object and then the other, and I told myself that they were huge airplanes, but then I realized that they were not airplanes, and I looked at the objects more closely. 
I noticed that they were circular in shape, and extremely bright. The objects appeared to be about 50 to 70 degrees from where I stood. They moved in a straight line, with no deviation whatever. The date which I forgot to mention was Tuesday, November 5, 1955. The following is a drawing of the designated objects:
