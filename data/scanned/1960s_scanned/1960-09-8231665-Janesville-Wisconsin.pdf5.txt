PAGE FOUR RJEDAH 79
WATCHED THE ECHO SATELLITE IN TERMS OF APPEARANCE AND ALTITUDE. HE 
STATED THAT THE UFO APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING EVEN FASTER THAN
THE ECHO SATELLITE. OF POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANCE IS A CURSORY REPORT 
FROM THE WEATHER OFFICER AT GENERAL MITCHELL FLD THAT A UFO WAS
SIGHTED OVER MUSKEGON, MICHIGAN THE SAME EVENING. NO FURTHER DE-
TAILS AVAILABLE. THE EVIDENCE AT HAND STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT
PATROLMAN GLASS OBSERVED TWO JETS FLYING. BECAUSE THEY WERE AT
32,232 FEET HE WAS UNABLE TO HEAR THE SOUND. RECALLING THE ECHO
SATELLITE, HE ASSUMED THAT HE WAS VIEWING ANOTHER SATELLITE, AND
WHEN THE AIRCRAFT CHANGED COURSE, HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND SATELLITES
VEERING, AND CONSEQUENTLY, ASSUMED THEM TO BE FLYING OBJECTS.
(1) NONE. END OF REPORT. THIS REPORT WAS VERIFIED BY MAJOR
FREDERICK H. WILLCOX, 32TH ADIV (SAGE), TRUAX FLD, WIS. INTELLIGENCE
OFFICER.
