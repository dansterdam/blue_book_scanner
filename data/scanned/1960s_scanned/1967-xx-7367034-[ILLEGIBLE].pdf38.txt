DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT
A red-yellow light, the size of a dinner plate, hovered in the sky for over an hour. At times it appeared to move slowly, then stop and hover. There was no sound. The light gave off a yellow glow and the edges were not as bright as the center. The light was observed by four people, two of whom watched it for over an hour. They described the light as "solid" and "definite" in shape. The light disappeared into the distance over the trees.
