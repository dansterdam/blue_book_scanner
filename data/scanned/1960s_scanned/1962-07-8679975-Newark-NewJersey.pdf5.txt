The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with a block of text that reads:

"NEWS BRIEFS: Contrary to popular belief, saucer reports are not really becoming less frequent. Here again we see a large part of the public believing that sightings have decreased significantly. Actually, the opposite is true. Official reports remain about the same, but many people have discontinued reporting sightings which they fear will not be taken seriously. This can be seen in the decrease in the number of official reports received in New York. The Air Force continues to investigate all sightings reported to it and maintains that any psychological research which may have indicated a decrease in sightings has been misjudged."
