Woody, New Jersey

Dear [REDACTED],

Thank you for your letter prompted by the article, "Outer-Space Ghost Story," which appeared in the February 22, 1966, issue of LIFE.

You and several other readers offered possible explanations for the U.F.O.'s, and the editors were appreciative of your taking the time to share your ideas with them. There is so little known about the subject, your comments were read with special care.

Again, our thanks for writing. We are always glad to hear from our readers.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
