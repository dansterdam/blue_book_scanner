Reference:    Your letter of 23 April 1969
Subject:      UFO Sightings of 3 April 68 from Cochrane, Wis. and
              17 April 1967 from Jefferson City, Missouri

To:          Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

1. Enclosed is a copy of letter to Mrs. dated 18 February 1969 
   as requested in your above referenced letter.

2. I am unable to send you the first transcript of my conversation with 
   Mr. as I had something wrong with my 
   recorder and I got nothing but a garbled sound.  I can assure you that
   the contents of the second tape are largely the same as the first.
