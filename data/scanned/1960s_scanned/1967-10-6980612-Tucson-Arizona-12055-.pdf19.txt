AT ABOUT 1200 HOURS ON 13 OCTOBER 1967, A WITNESS OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OVER TUCSON, ARIZONA.

THE WITNESS REPORTS THAT HE OBSERVED A BRIGHT WHITE OBJECT MOVING IN THE SKY. THE OBJECT DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE WINGS OR OTHER CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT FEATURES. THE OBJECT MOVED RAPIDLY AND CHANGED DIRECTION SUDDENLY WITHOUT SLOWING DOWN.

THE WITNESS ATTEMPTED TO PHOTOGRAPH THE OBJECT BUT THE PHOTOGRAPHS DID NOT TURN OUT WELL DUE TO THE BRIGHT LIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE OBJECT.

THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 TO 3 MINUTES BEFORE DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW.
