UFO Observation, 17 May 1957

Washington, D. C. 20034

I refer to your phone call I had made that I was mailing this to you and it is in this that the item to you was that I told you of the report.

I think it would be best if you contact the information this was given to me. I feel with all certainty as an officer who has been constantly connected and discussed by an intermediary. The questions are often proficient and I will be very interested in your comments.

Sincerely, 

VICTOR CHIRUANTALLA, Jr. Major, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
