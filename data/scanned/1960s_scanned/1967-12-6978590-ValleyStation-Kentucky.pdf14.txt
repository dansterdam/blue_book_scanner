The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document. I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON? Initially light attracted my attention as I was watching the movie screen.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR? As silently traveled across the sky, it passed through thin layers of clouds, increasing in brightness after passing overhead and descending at a great angle at about 60 degrees above the horizon. It finally grew dimmer as it entered the clouds and disappeared.  

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? Clouds, but never completely disappearing.
