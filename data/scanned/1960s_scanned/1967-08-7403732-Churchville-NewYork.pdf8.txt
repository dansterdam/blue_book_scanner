DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY 

FEB 8 1967

Dear Mr. _______,

President Johnson has asked that I reply to your recent letter regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The Air Force is responsible for investigating reported sightings of UFOs to determine if they pose a threat to the United States. After investigating some 12,000 sightings in the past 20 years, NO EVIDENCE HAS EVER BEEN REVEALED THAT UFOs ARE A THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. However, we will continue to investigate any information on UFOs which I hope you will find interesting and informative.

I am informed that we do not have a record of the sighting of August 1967 which you mention. Therefore, it is requested you complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the envelope provided so that an analysis of your observation can be made. It will not be necessary for you to travel to Washington to make this report.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

Sincerely,

B. M. ETTENSON
Colonel, USAF
