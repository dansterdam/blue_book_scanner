COMMENT: No one else of all the cars on S. Lake Shore Drive that night appeared to notice anything unusual was one of the reasons this woman made her sighting. Her car also witnessed this.

ADDITION: Some pictures which appeared in The Chicago's American dated Sunday July 12, 1959 were reported to be very similar to this sighting. These pictures appeared two days AFTER her sighting. G/D
