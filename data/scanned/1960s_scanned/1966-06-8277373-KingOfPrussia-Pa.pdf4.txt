The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, specifically from the file "1966-06-8277373-KingOfPrussia-Pa.pdf4.txt".

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know.
IF you answered YES,

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know.
IF you answered YES,

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: NONE AND END - EXCEPTIONALLY BRIGHT
b. Color: WHITE

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

STEADY LARGER THAN HEAD - MUCH WIDER THAN HEAD

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch all of the other things you see such as wings, portrustons, etc., and specifically indicate scale or where you were in relation to the object.
