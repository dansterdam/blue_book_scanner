Dear Project Blue Book,
I am writing you this letter because of my many sightings of U.F.O. Here is a brief description of my encounter with a U.F.O.: I was walking along my alley on a Sunday, when all of a sudden I saw what appeared to be a saucer. I stared at it for about 5 minutes. I estimate its height at about 250 feet in the air. It was about 150 to 200 feet away. I knew it couldn't be a jet or a plane, because of the way it flew. It was traveling at about 75 m.p.h. Also there was another strange thing about the saucer. It let out a thick cloud of smoke at just before it disappeared. It disappeared from sight in a instant. It also made no noise whatsoever. I hope you will give this incident a clear thinking over. Also if you find the time, to write me a letter giving me some possibilities on my incident. Also there were no witnesses except myself. Thank You.

Sincerely yours,
