one thousand light years is the maximum distance at which interstellar communications have any meaning at all, and from both U. S. and USSR work in the area, the existence of only one similar civilization at most can be expected.

One major factor agreed by both is the high improbability of our planet being visited by extraterrestrial life from another solar system. Even the nearest stars that resemble our own sun in age and type are about ten to eleven years distant. Such a round trip from a distant neighboring solar system would encompass over twenty years, traveling at speeds approaching the speed of light. Astronomers of both countries postulate that a high probability for extraterrestrial life exists. To date, though, there has been no confirmation of the theory.
