The image contains a compass-like diagram and two sketches. The compass-like diagram appears to be an illustration used for indicating the position of a phenomenon when it was last seen, as mentioned in the text below the diagram. The two sketches depict a person standing between two landscapes, likely representing a visual observation of a UFO-related phenomenon.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE PLACE AN X AT
DIRECTION TO TIlE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A d-d° ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE
THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON LAST CAME. 

BASED ON THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN, CONNECT THE X AND d-d° WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON BY COMPARISON WITH KNOWN OBJECTS AND SKETCH IN LARGER SKETCH.
