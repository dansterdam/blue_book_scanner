It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document that describes an incident involving Air Force jets chasing a saucer-shaped object over Lake Superior on August 8, 1965. The text provides details about the incident, including the estimated speed of the object (5,000 to 17,000 feet per second) and the fact that the object was spotted on radar. The text also suggests that the incident was likely a hoax or could have been a misidentification of some other phenomenon.
