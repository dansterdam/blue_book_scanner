DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
STAND MOTIONLESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
MAKE A NOISE?
ATTRACT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

I just happen to notice a while reddish object in the distance and stopped to see it was moving.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Faded out.

Q. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING?
It moved over a tree. It seemed to be in front or behind was hard to determine the distance; it would say it was on the side of the tree and it was 2 to 3 miles away.
