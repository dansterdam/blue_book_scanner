Dear Sir:

We have received by the Indiana State Police Department a report concerning the sighting of a luminous object at 8:00 p.m. on November 19, 1965, at approximately Huntington, Indiana. 

On the evening of November 19, 1965 at approximately 8:00 p.m., several people reported observing a bright object hovering in the sky. The object was described as being about the size of a basketball, and appeared to be luminous - shining with a light that seemed to be almost like a miniature sun. The object was hovering and moving back and forth slowly from white to yellow, then to red, creating a tremendous speed handling. The object was observed for quite some time and was finally lost from sight.

Objects were seen in the past, similar to such as the present description, but after a brief observation they would disappear, and this one did not.

It is our hope that this information may be of some assistance.

Very truly yours,
