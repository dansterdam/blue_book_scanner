Repeated sightings of UFOs, and the persistence of the 
Air Force and the responsible scientific community in ex-
plaining the sightings away, has suggested to some that a
conspiracy exists to conceal from the public the true nature
of the UFOs.  Might not at least a small fraction of the
residual 1% of the sightings be space vehicles of intelli-
gent extraterrestrial origin, observing the Earth and its
inhabitants?  Let us examine this possibility.

It now seems quite clear that the Earth is not the
only inhabited planet.  There is evidence that the bulk of
the stars in the sky have planetary systems.  Recent re-
search concerning the origin of life on Earth suggests that
the physical and chemical processes leading to the origin
of life occur rapidly in the early history of the majority
of planets.  The selective value of intelligence and tech-
nical civilization is so obvious, and it seems likely that a
large number of planets within our Milky Way galaxy --
perhaps as many as a million -- are inhabited by technical
civilizations in advance of our own.  Interstellar space-
flight is far beyond our present technical capabilities,
but there seem to be no fundamental physical objections to
