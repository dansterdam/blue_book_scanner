The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Technically they are treated in two books to which I had immediate access, Light and Colour in the Open Sky, by Minnuert and Chemistry, by Senson and Flang. As here the lights are described even into their colors, red, yellow, white and green, thus matching the colors described by the majority of the witnesses. It is stated that in these books, the lights generally are a form of low temperature chemical luminescence which does not char or burn grass, etc. The lights generally are evanescent, burning here for a moment or so, going out, and appearing some feet or yards away as another plume of gas spontaneously ignites. This sporadic lighting is general soundless, although sometimes a "popping" noise is heard (this may be the origin of the "ricochet sound"). Mr. Manner reported the illusion of motion can easily be caused by the sporadic appearance of a wisp of light here and then there. The lights have never been described as truly bright. They would be visible best to dark-adapted eyes on a clear dark night and also on a night which there was no high wind (which would quickly dissipate the gas as it built up from underneath). It appears to me that all the major conditions for the appearance or signs were satisfied even as considered very probable. I can't state with any certainty that this is the correct solution to the problem; merely that it is the most likely natural cause. I would of course, appreciate learning of other possible natural causes should they be forthcoming. We can, I believe, completely eliminate any solution based on e/c, balloons, birds, meteors, stars, etc, because they simply do not fit the consistent data reported to me.
