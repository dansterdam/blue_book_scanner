There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old report documenting a UFO sighting. The text visible on the page consists of a series of questions about the observed phenomenon, such as whether it moved in a straight line, stood still at any time, suddenly sped up and ran away, broke up in parts and exploded, changed color, etc. There is also a handwritten response to the question "What drew your attention to the phenomenon?".
