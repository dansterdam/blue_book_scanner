The text in the document states:
"June 23rd, 1964. Herald-Telephone received a call from a local young couple who reported that, while driving home from work, they had observed a bright object in the sky which seemed to be maneuvering in an unusual manner. They stopped their automobile, got out, and observed the object for several minutes. They stated that the object changed color from bright red to green to yellow, and seemed to be oscillating or wobbling. The object then appeared to dart suddenly, from their line of sight, approximately 1/4 mile distant. The couple had no explanation for what they had observed."
