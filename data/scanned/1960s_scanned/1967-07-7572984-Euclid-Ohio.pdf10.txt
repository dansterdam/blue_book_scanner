UFO SIGHTING CAUSES A STIR ON EAST 201ST
It was a different colors. It was slower than
a jet plane and seemed to be floating. A crowd
of 50 to 75 people gathered to watch it as it
hovered over the horizon." McCreight said, "It
seemed to have a halo around it. It was two or
three times the size of a jet plane. The UFO
appeared behind clouds and then seemed to move
away and disappear."
MRS. RUDOLPH BEHAN, 94 East 201st st.,
said, "I was in my backyard when I saw it. It was
hovering overhead and making an up and down
motion. It seemed to move away and then come
back again. The Police came."
DAVID McCREIGHT, 93 East 201st st., said,
"I saw it too but I've never seen anything like it
before. I happened to be outside in my yard and I
looked up and there it was over the horizon.
MRS. BEHAN said, "It seemed to have a
halo around it and it was two or three times the
size of a jet plane. It just hung there and then
would suddenly disappear." 
DR. JOHN MESSINA, 5030 Edgewater,
Cleveland, said, "I can't imagine what it could
have been. I saw it too. It appeared to move away
and then come back again." 
NORMAN CONRAD, 93 East 201st st., said,
"It looked like a ball of fire, but it wasn't on
fire." McCieigh said, "It wasn't an airplane. They
are certain something was there."
