The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or memo describing a "Physical Specimen" recovered from Cypress Gardens, Florida on 2 June 1968. The memo discusses the approximate content of the specimen, which is described as 90% silicon oxide and 10% iron oxide. The document notes that the specimen is light and appears to have a lot of air holes, and that gases escaping from it could have caused air holes and made the specimen warm to the touch when it came into contact with the surface of the water.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
11 JULY 1959

SUBJ: Physical Specimen, Cypress Gardens Florida, 2 June 1968

Lt Carmen I. Marano spoke with Mr Edward Williams, ACIC, regarding a specimen recovered at Cypress Gardens, Florida. The approximate content of 90% silicon oxide and 10% iron oxide would not be a meteorite. Normally a meteorite is quite heavy and this sample is light and appears to have a lot of air holes. The specimen is probably volcanic rock (pumice) and could have come up from the hot springs. The gases escaping would cause air holes and the specimen could be warm to the touch when it arose to the surface of the water.
