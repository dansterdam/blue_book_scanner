By now Chris tessey
suspect the cause of the strange behavior
of the plants indicated in the last report may be
due to a disturbance in the ionic concentration
of the soil or other chemical changes occurring
in the vegetation, along with the fact that certain
inorganic compounds were secreted into the soil. This
would account for the marginal yellowing and
discoloration observed. The sickness and eventual
death of some of the plants could also be explained
by the toxic effects of these secretions.
