AIR FORCE COMMANDOS
TO HELP train allies
The newly activated Air Force Commando units, pioneers of unconventional warfare, have been given a new mission--to help train allies, especially South Vietnamese troops, and to assist free world military forces in guerrilla and pacification activities.
This new mission, which will continue the earlier air support and tactical air strike capability of the Commandos, is aimed at providing free world forces with maximum flexibility, mobility and firepower in the struggle against Communism. The Commandos' role will be to provide mobile training teams and operational assistance to friendly nations in selected areas.
The Commando units, originally organized in the late 1950's for special air operations, have been greatly enlarged and strengthened since then. Now numbers of trained personnel, special equipment and aircraft are available for intensified training and advisory missions to assist our allies. This expanded force will provide valuable support and capability not only to South Vietnam but to other free world nations as well.
