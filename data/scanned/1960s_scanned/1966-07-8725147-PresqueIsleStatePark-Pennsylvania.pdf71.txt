Transcribing the text in the image:

At about 7:30 pm. lights were seen coming and going in the sky. The shape was round and silvery... the lights changed color from red to green to white. The lights moved very fast.

The lights seemed to hover just above the ground for a few seconds. As the object moved, the lights on it changed color. The object then shot straight up into the night sky and disappeared.

The ground was scattered with debris after the object left. Some of the debris appeared to be pieces of metal.
