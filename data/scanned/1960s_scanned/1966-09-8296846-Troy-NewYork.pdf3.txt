The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document.

Estimate it in about 200 phleeting
This object was in about 200 I thought it highly improbable that such an unusual sight might be explained by natural causes. As it was getting dark, I watched the object very carefully for about 10 minutes as it moved slowly and silently across the sky in a meandering path, occasionally changing direction slightly. The object was definitely not an aircraft or satellite, and was much larger and brighter than any stars or planets in the night sky.

After observing the object for some time, I decided to get a better look at it and went inside my home to get my camera. However, when I returned outside, the object had disappeared. I searched the sky for several more minutes but could not locate it again. 

Although I was not able to capture any photographs, the experience was very memorable and puzzling. I have no explanation for what the object could have been, but it was clearly something out of the ordinary that I had never seen before. I suspect it may have been some kind of unidentified flying object, but I cannot say for certain. All I know is that it was a strange sight that has left me curious and intrigued.
