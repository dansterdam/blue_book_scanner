The image appears to be a photograph of some kind of unusual structure or object. The text at the top of the image indicates that this is a "FLIGHT TECHNOLOGY DIVISION, ATTSE" document, and the image itself is marked as "UNCLASSIFIED".

The image shows a white, dome-like structure with a tall, thin supporting structure or column. The text written on the image states "Original photograph shows only one item", suggesting that this may be a cropped or altered version of the original photograph.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document, without any additional commentary:

FLIGHT TECHNOLOGY DIVISION, ATTSE
UNCLASSIFIED
Original photograph shows only one item
