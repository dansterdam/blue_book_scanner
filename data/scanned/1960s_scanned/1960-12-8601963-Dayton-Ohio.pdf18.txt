This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a questionnaire or form with instructions and questions related to the observation of an unidentified object or objects.

TEXT OUTPUT:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or some's length in line with a known object at the distance of the sighting. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as that which you saw.
