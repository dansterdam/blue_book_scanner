EXTRACT FROM SGT MOODY'S TRIP REPORT TO LANSING, MICHIGAN AREA

It was learned that the FAA in Lansing turned over control of flight to operators from 0800 to 0900 for a classified military operation. Rogge (Sgt Roeser) the SVDTC site director, was on duty and made arrangements with the FAA for the military operation.

Local weather data was obtained for 13 June and used in the investigation.

The discussion with the tower operators James Mackey on UFO's and the lighting observations in the area when many calls are received by the tower operators. The operators usually explain the observations to callers as known electrical installations which can obstruct the view of the entire area.

A flight of F-86? Sgt Moody returned to the motel. 

On the morning of 13 Jun 64, Sgt Moody proceeded from East Lansing, Michigan to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and contacted Sgt Larson of the AFROTC. Sgt Larson directed Sgt Moody to the University Lighting control room where measurements were being made during daylight hours of illumination.

Sgt Moody proceeded to the hangar where Michigan University astrophysical equipment was stored. He was shown various astronomical observation equipment but was not able to determine any relationship to the Ann Arbor Airport operations.

This indicates that the conducte investigation at the Ann Arbor Airport had no flights in the Lansing area during the 23-25 May period. Mr. Smith also indicated that there had been no flight activity except that which was observed by photo activity, etc., during this period.

Smith was contacted by telephone and he indicated that his company had the FAA weather data for the Lansing area. He was advised that it had been examined and found good, so his company records would not be required. 

This confirms that the flight of an F-86 observed in the Michigan area in about 2305-2330 in 15 May was the last flight in Michigan area. There was no other flight activity in the Lansing area during the period.
