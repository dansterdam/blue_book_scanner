Major Quintanilla
September 29, 1966

I conclude he saw something moving rapidly in front of him high in the sky. He then "lost the object for a few minutes". Here the word "lost" probably means "lost sight of," minutes."

I am not particularly impressed with Mr. _______ or his observation abilities. I must say that I am of the opinion that a considerable amount of technical jargon was used that a lot of additional questions should have been asked. This is part of why I refuse with these investigations to follow the phrase "gone a moment mechanicl action occurred when first arrived" mean?

As you have probably inferred, I am sitting here dictating, studying the report before me to do so.

My chief conclusion is that objects A and B were entirely different. There was a sholongish shifting to connect B with A. The motion toward the south was just imagination. The speed of motion toward the south was approximately zero or star. The object seen above the house was probably a cloud, a slowly moving natural phenomena, not near the house or anything else. The motion of B away from A was as near as possible an illusion, since if the car was invisible, the car was moving north an undetermined number of times the distance of the house over which he passed. Did he see the object as it passed by the house, which he passed? Do not question that as his statement about the motion toward the south based on his assumption that object B was the same as object A I must assume is in error while. He must have thought that the object was still further to the north, if it had moved with to meet the car.
