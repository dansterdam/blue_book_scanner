THE UNDERSIGNED, BEING DULY SWORN, DEPOSES AND SAYS:

On August 9, 1965, at approximately 10:30 P.M., I, along with two other people, saw a bright light in the sky flying north to south at a very high speed. The light was visible for approximately 30 seconds. It was not an airplane or satellite, nor a helicopter, as it was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. I would estimate the speed to be at least 1,000 miles per hour. The light was several times brighter than any star or planet and left no trail or sound. It simply disappeared from sight.
I have no explanation for what we saw but it was definitely not an ordinary aircraft. I have seen many planes and satellites in the sky but this was unlike anything I have ever seen before. It was too fast and too bright to be anything I am familiar with.
The incident took place on the north side of Lake Melissa near the town of Audubon, Minnesota.
