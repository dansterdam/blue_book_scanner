SAF-OTCC/Miss Turnure/76926/September 9, 1968

Dear Mr. _____,

This will reply to your recent letter in which you inclosed a photographic print.

In order to analyze photography, we must have the original negatives. In addition, we should have as much of the following information as possible:

(a) Type and make of camera used.
(b) Type of film, shutter speed, and make of lens.
(c) Aperture setting.
(d) Shutter speed.
(e) Time of exposure used, that is "t" stop.
(f) Type of tripod or solid stand used.
(g) Was "panning" used.
(h) Exact direction camera was pointing with relation to true north, and its angle with respect to the ground.

Because we cannot use the print you sent to us for analysis, it is inclosed.

Sincerely,
JAMES H. AIKMAN
