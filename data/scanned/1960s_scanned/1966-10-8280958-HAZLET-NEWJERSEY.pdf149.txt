Clifford Woodward, Aug 26, 1956. Hazlet, N.J. phone 2r-4-0231. Sighting: Thurs. Oct. 6, 1966 at 7:00 P looked at clock when he went in, last detail seeing it; a total time lasts for 15 minutes.

Location of sighting: 15 mile from Hazlet near airport. Here is his account for 3 of 15 minutes: About 7:00 PM he arrives home, happens to look up, and sees a stationary light in the 3 M.P. It was a very bright white light that shown like a star. It appeared about half the size of the moon. It appeared about 15 degrees above the horizon and seemed to be drifting slowly toward the west. Suddenly it began to move toward the NE and its speed increased. Now viewed through trees it glowed brightly down to earth. By 3 minutes it crossed the sky and passed out of sight. It was LCC fast, about 70 degrees elevation at about 20 or 25 miles per hour. It was going so slow he thought it almost hover. Then it shot out of sight. The bright lights went out the size of a pea light in relation to the object was spaced around the outside of the object. These blinked in sequence as it moved toward the NE. As it got further away the lights began to disappear and it seemed to fade into obscuring haze. Object disappeared into a dark cloud.
