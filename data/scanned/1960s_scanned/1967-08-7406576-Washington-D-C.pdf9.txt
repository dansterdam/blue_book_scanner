The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, showing a typed letter by Willard D. Nielson, 1st Lt., USAF, describing his opinion that the object sighted over Georgetown on August 1967 was likely a red lighted balloon released as a hoax. The letter is addressed to the University of Colorado, ATTN: Dr. Condon.

It is my opinion that the object sighted over Georgetown on 12 August 1967 was either a red lighted balloon released by someone as a hoax. I plan to take no further action unless the object reappears.
