The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

To whom it may concern, 
This letter is of no value to you.But I was reading a Science & Mechanic Magazine and it has a write up on -- UFO.Now,I'll tell you I read everything I can on this subject,so you don't have to. It's all baloney.But if you don't want to be taken in by the magazines hit home.
It was 1:55 in the morning this March fighting of this year.I can't tell you just exactly what I can't tell you but I can tell --my wife saw it first.She told me to get up and look at it.I did,but I didn't pay much attention to it.But though it was beautiful,I went back to --be--,but I could see the light on the bedroom wall,and it was awful bright.
The next morning,my wife was still talking about it.So I told her I didn't believe a word of it.Though it was awfully bright,I guess at times the lights in the house might be brighter and bigger than it should had been.But I was sleepy and it didn't impress me much.
At 1:00 the next morning I was getting ready for bed,after watching a late movie.So I went out on side to see were.I couldn't find it.
Just two or three nights were clear,and I don't know whether the moon was a half or just about 25 degrees off.But whatever it was,I was a brilliance of light brighter than this house or buildings around.
"We have talked about this to ourselves".Says it was Jupiter.But I don't see how it could be that big and not the next-but I sure wish I had made up and watched it a little longer than I did.If you could tell me if I was wrong,or give us an explanation.I would appreciate it.Cause it look like our names kept out of print.
I hope you can read this.I'm not the best typist in the world.And I hope this doesn't waste too much of your time.
