AN ENCOUNTER

as a man. His eyes were more slit-like and I could hardly see a mouth, but his nose was definitely the snout of an animal -- maybe a dog or a cat. It was not very pretty! I stood there frozen, for there were no more pictures and my mind was churning with confused thoughts.

I looked all around the inside of the glass dome and did not understand. All I could see now were the leaves from the top of a tall tree sticking out in the yard where the dome rested. Glass and trying to find an answer. Suddenly, a tiny yellow light appeared on the other side of the glass from where the being had been. It looked for the source of the yellow light, but it was not shining then, and I realized it came from a reflection on the window sill. But by all laws of reflection, I should have seen more than a tiny flash -- I should have seen the substantial outline of my personality dissolved for the appearing of the light. Slowly it became stronger and stronger until it looked like an eye in the manner of a wrap around a face, but I thought then that it must have some reference to vision, to some understanding or unseen that I had seen. I tried to reason that the unknown living creature was as the portrayal of an all-loving God, and yet to me the sight was unwelcome. When his Death Camps were exposed, this thought did not seem true. What was Christ doing with all those men who were infirm? And infamy? And torture? And to those in Plesau's famous painting "Guernica" which found no answer, and I pushed away the thought that these could come from God Himself. It was too overwhelming to believe.
