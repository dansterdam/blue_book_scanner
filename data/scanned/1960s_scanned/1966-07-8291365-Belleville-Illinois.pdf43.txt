U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION

This questionnaire has been prepared so that you can give the U.S. Air Force as much information as possible regarding any unidentified aerial phenomena that you have observed.

Please fill out this form as completely as possible. The more complete the information, the better the Air Force can analyze the sighting. We request that you not be used in connection with any writings, since the reason for the investigation is to determine if the sighting has any intelligence value. We suggest that you not discuss the sighting with anyone other than the investigating officer, since premature discussion may lead to reactions that could influence the basic facts of the sighting.
