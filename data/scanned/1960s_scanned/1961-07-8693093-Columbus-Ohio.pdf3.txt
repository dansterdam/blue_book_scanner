1. The following, extracted from 1/Lt Kimball's report dated 1 July 1961, is submitted for your information:
0930 hours: The 9370th Command Post, received call from a local resident who reported seeing a bright light in the sky at an elevation of about 20 degrees. The light was observed for about 5-7 minutes and disappeared. The ability to track and identify the object was not present as the ground observer was not equipped with necessary instruments.
0315 hours: Received call from local resident concerning UFO. Preliminary conclusion on ground observer's evaluation: He observed a bright light and thought it was a UFO, but no further action was taken as he did not think it necessary to alert Aerial Defense Command.
0315 hours: Received call from USAF Command Post, Major Hill, who stated that a Florida state trooper had called to report that he had observed a UFO at about 0300 hours. The observer said that it appeared to be round and bright and that it hovered and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. No further information was obtained and no action was taken.
