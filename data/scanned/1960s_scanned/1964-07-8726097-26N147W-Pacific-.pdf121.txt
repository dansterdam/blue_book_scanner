Gentlemen:

My five girls a were watching the phenomena from our house, when an unusual explosion was seen. This lasted for some seconds and small bright lights (terminal) rose toward the horizon. Each disappeared at the same point.

The sighting was near the horizon. Time of sighting approximately 8:15 p.m. E.S.T.
