OBSERVATIONS-- I saw and identified as a large white light in the sky which was moving in a downward direction at a high rate of speed. The light was observed for approximately 15-20 seconds and disappeared from view. The object was first observed at approximately 1845 hours and was in view for approximately 15-20 seconds. NO SOUND WAS HEARD. The object was observed to be descending at a high rate of speed. IT APPEARED TO BE SILVERY-WHITE IN COLOR AND SEEMED TO BE OVAL IN SHAPE. IT COVERED A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 30-40 DEGREES IN THE SKY. THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY AND THE VISIBILITY WAS GOOD. I HAVE BEEN OBSERVING AND CHECKING THIS TYPE OF PHENOMENA FOR SOME TIME AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT WHAT I SAW WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. IT WAS MOVING TOO FAST AND DESCENDING TOO RAPIDLY TO BE A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. I WOULD APPRECIATE FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT.
