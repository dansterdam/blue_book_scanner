Dear Har,
you are g glad to hear we are well. We have had a busy year as usual, and as you know. Ren has not been too well since last spring. He has had a very bad case of sinus trouble, and has taken quite a bit of treatment. He seems much better now, however, and we are hoping this will be the end of it for awhile. Ren's work at the High School has been very demanding, and on top of that he has a good many outside activities and responsibilities, so he has not had much time for relaxation and rest. However, we are planning a trip to Las Vegas over the Thanksgiving holiday, and are looking forward to that.

We were very sorry to hear about your father's illness, and hope he is improving. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. I am enclosing a little something extra in this letter for you and yours.

Best wishes for a Happy Thanksgiving and a Merry Christmas.

Love,
Ren and Neta
