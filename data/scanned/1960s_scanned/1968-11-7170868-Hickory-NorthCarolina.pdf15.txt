OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Nov. 29, 1968

Dear:

The U. S. Air Force Recruiting Office in Hickory has forwarded your report of a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) to this office.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you observed. Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is better qualified to make an accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories or objects often reported as UFO's in the Project Blue Book we are enclosing.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
