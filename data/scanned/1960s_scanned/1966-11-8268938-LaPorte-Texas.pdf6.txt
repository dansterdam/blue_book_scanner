10. Air Traffic and Balloon Releases:
(A) Remarks: The observer reported seeing what he thought was a jet fighter type aircraft producing a con-trail approach the UFO from the west at an altitude much higher than the UFO. When the jet reached the UFO, both stopped and hovered for a few seconds, then the jet turned and proceeded in a northerly direction. The observer did not think the jet could have seen the UFO because of the higher altitude. No jet aircraft departed from Ellington weather station stated that jet aircraft would produce con-trails at 25,000 feet and higher.
