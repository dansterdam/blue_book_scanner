Dear Sir,

I am writing some more details and information concerning the unidentified flying object sighted in West Hyattsville, Maryland on October 3, 1966. As I already stated, I was observing things and when I realized I was seeing something, I watched it for some time.

The object appeared to be about 30 seconds in arc, shaped like an ellipse, and about 20-30 cm wide. It was completely silent. I watched it travel through the sky until it was lost from sight.

I have no explanation for what I saw, and I am unable to describe it as anything conventional. I hope this additional information is helpful to you.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted]
