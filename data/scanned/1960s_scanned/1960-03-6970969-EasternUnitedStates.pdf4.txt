All the text found in the document is as follows:

"All the objects had about the same colors, a light orange-ish hue, roughly the same size, and were traveling at a high speed from North to South. Their brightness was approximately, that brightness was halfway between extremely bright and extremely dim.

I have been wondering if these might have been jet planes with afterburners on, but the formation seemed a little unusual for this, and if they were they must have been much closer than my guess and should have been more distinct. I would be most interested in knowing whether you have had any other reports of this particular incident."

Yours very truly,
