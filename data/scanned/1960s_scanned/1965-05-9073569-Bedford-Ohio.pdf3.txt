The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, consisting of typed text.

The text in the document is as follows:

The President has asked that I reply to your letter regarding unidentified flying objects.  

The United States Air Force has concluded its investigation of reported unidentified flying objects, known as Project Blue Book, and has found no evidence of a threat to national security or of any scientific importance.

The responsibility for investigating unidentified flying objects now rests with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Air Force will continue to forward to NASA any reports of unidentified flying objects that come to its attention. If you have any further questions, I suggest you communicate directly with NASA.
