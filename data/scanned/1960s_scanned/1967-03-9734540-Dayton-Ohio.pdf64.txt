The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The text on the page consists of a series of questions related to the observed object, such as whether it disappeared, moved behind or in front of something, and descriptions of its sound and color. There is also a request to draw a picture showing the shape and motion of the object. The text appears to be a standardized form for collecting information about UFO sightings.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and here how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
