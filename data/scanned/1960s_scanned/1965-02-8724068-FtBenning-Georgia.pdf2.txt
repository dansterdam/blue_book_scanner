UFO Observation, 27 Feb 65, Captain Mosley 1 Apr 65

WROB
Robins AFB, Georgia

1. We have received a report from AJAOC, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Intelligence, 17 Mar 65, regarding an observation by Captain Mosley on 27 February 1965.

2. This observation was either a meteor or a portion of a satellite re-entry. According to SPADES, the initial observation was to the southwest and the object was moving towards the northeast. This motion can be interpreted as being to the northeast following the curvature of the earth.

3. Observations of this nature are desired not only by the United States Air Force but also by NASA and the President of the American Meteorological Society. If the observation is considered to be a meteor it should be reported to the American Meteor Society. If the observation is doubtful with, or has characteristics of, a satellite re-entry, it should be reported to Aerial Phenomena Branch (TDEW), Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433.
