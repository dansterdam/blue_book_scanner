Dear Sir,

This letter is in reference to the strange aerial phenomenon which I witnessed over New York City on the night of March 4, 1962. I was astonished at what I saw and still do not know what to make of it.

It was an unusually clear night and I happened to be looking up at the sky when I noticed a brilliant light hovering and moving in a zig-zag pattern at a great velocity. It seemed to be at a high altitude and was changing directions sharply without any loss of speed. After watching it for some time, I realized that this was no conventional aircraft. I have never seen anything like it before.

The light seemed to be self-illuminated and did not appear to have any wings or other distinguishing features of an airplane. It moved in a very erratic manner, accelerating rapidly and then abruptly changing course. I was mesmerized by the sight and tried to keep it in view as long as possible, but it eventually disappeared from sight.

I hope you will look into this matter and see what can be determined. I would like to know if others have reported similar sightings in the area. Whatever this phenomenon was, it was certainly unlike anything I have ever seen in the sky before.

Yours truly,
[Name redacted]

P.S. I saw the smoke from my cigarette reflected in the window.
