"STRANGE LIGHT' OBSERVED

Deputies See Object In Sky

At about 2:30 a.m. Deputy Sheriffs Baker and Clark, along with 3 others, saw a very strange bright light in the sky. They said it appeared to be oval-shaped and was moving erratically. The deputies said it seemed to change color from white to reddish-orange. They watched it for about fifteen minutes before it disappeared. 

Deputies Baker and Clark were extremely excited about the sighting and even called the sheriff's office to report it. The dispatcher, according to the report, was also able to see the object from the sheriff's office but was unable to get a good look at it due to the distance. 

The object was reportedly high in the sky, according to the deputies, and seemed to hover at times. They also said it made no sound and appeared to be completely silent. 

Ralph L. Jordan is a 27-year-old resident of the Bermuda area, and he also reported seeing the strange object in the sky at about the same time as the deputies. He stated that it seemed to change directions and appeared to be several miles away.

We didn't hear anything, but the light was just a steady, very bright light. It seemed to be hovering in the sky for a few minutes, then it just shot off and disappeared."
