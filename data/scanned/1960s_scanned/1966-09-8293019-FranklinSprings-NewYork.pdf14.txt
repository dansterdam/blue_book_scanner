Various events took place south of here that night. I saw a strange blue light, about the size of a basketball, apparently hovering or floating a few feet above the ground. It hovered for a moment, then dropped out of sight behind some trees - I couldn't see it fall or move away. It was silent, and I didn't see it again. I went back the next morning to look around for it, but couldn't find any evidence of where it had been. There were no power lines or other objects near where I saw it. The only sound was a slight humming noise that seemed to come from near where the light had been hovering. I can't explain what it was, but it didn't seem like any ordinary light or object I've ever seen before. I thought you might be interested in this additional information.
