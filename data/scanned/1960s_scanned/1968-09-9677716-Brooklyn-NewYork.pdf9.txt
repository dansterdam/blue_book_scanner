The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch depicts an oval-shaped object with some details inside. There is no photograph present in this particular page of the Project Blue Book document.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the textual output found in the document:

"13. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE CLEARLY BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR A TREE. ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. HOW MUCH OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED."
