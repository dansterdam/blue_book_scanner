On the morning of 18 January 1965, approximately at 0800 hours, Mr. Spauldin:, an employee of the Bureau of Investigation for the US Air Force, was driving to work and sighted an unidentified flying object. In an oral statement, Mr. Spauldin reported the following:

"As I was driving to work this morning about 0800 hours, I sighted what appeared to be a red colored object in the sky. It was a clear day and the object was visible for about ten minutes. The object appeared to be hovering and then suddenly took off at a high rate of speed, leaving the area. There were three slides taken from this sighting. The negative is attached. I don't know whether the slides can be repaired."
