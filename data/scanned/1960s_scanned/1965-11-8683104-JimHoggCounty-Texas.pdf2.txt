TDEW/UFO JAN 14 1966
UFO SIGHTINGS, FALFURRIAS, TEXAS

1. The Air Force has received five reports of unidentified aerial objects. The analysis indicates that five sightings of unidentified aerial objects have been evaluated as legitimate reports. The analysis indicates that the actual sightings evaluated as aircraft cannot be identified with known aerial vehicles. The conclusion is consistent with this evaluation. At present, many military and civilian agencies concur with a real potential menace of flights of unidentified objects.

2. It is suggested that a fact sheet be attached to explain present Air Force position on unidentified flying objects.
