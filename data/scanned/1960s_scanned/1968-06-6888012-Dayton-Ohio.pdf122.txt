The charts in this publication are continuations of the principal charts of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All the charts in this publication are arranged on a single page of this publication.

These are operational weather maps prepared by the National Meteorological Center of Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500-Millibar Chart are the same as those used previously. An explanatory sheet is available and may be obtained by writing to Environmental Services Administration, Rockville, Maryland 20852.

The 500-Millibar Weather Map presents the height contours of the 500-millibar surface. The isotherms are shown as continuous lines and are related to real shows surface in real level. The temperature values are shown as dashed lines and are related to the 500-millibar level. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredths of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are under lines. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.
