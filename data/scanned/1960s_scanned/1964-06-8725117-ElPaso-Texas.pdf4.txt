Transcribed text:

These people report another flying disc over El Paso. Texas, on approximately April 3, 1964 at approx. 11:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. on April 4, 1964.

The object was described as bright, round, clear, about 50 to 100 feet in diameter and hovered over a desert area about 5 to 10 miles from El Paso, Texas. The object emitted no sound and remained stationary for about 1 hour.

Several witnesses saw the object, including a Mr. and Mrs. Charles Smith, who live in a remote area about 10 miles from El Paso, Texas. They observed the object through field glasses and stated that it hovered silently and emitted no light. They watched it for over an hour.

My suggestion would be to contact the witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Smith, to verify the details of their observation. This may provide additional information regarding the sighting.

Sincerely,
Redacted Name
