OUTPUT TEXT:

"DIST/CHGH: 1/2 - 1 mile estimated.
G. FLIGHT PATH: Each followed an identical path, straight and level flight at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet. No turns, no changes in speed or altitude were observed.
H: TIME: These you can see why a UFO Report was filled. In September 1965, both these witnesses had an encounter with a unusual object while traveling along Rt. 107, close to the town of Bethel, Vermont.
Their attention was first attracted by a bright intense light in the sky some distance ahead of them. This light appeared to be stationary at first but as they approached, it suddenly started to move in a horizontal direction. It appeared to be a circular object which was emitting a very bright glow. It was not a pulsing light but rather a continuous type of emission.
The object remained in view for some 3-4 minutes and then suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared over the horizon.
COMMENTS: This is another very good report which seems to have been compiled objectively and without any obvious attempt to sensationalize the incident. The length of observation, 3-4 minutes, is quite adequate to provide useful details, and the speed of acceleration observed when the object left the scene is certainly well beyond the capabilities of any conventional aircraft.
The fact that two independent witnesses saw the same thing and described it in similar terms lends added credence to the report.
