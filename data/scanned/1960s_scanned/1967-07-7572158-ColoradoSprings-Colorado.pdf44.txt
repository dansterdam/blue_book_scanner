Official U.S. Air Force UFO form
19 July 1967
I am a member of an Nsa P and 
so I always keep an eye out for 
UFO's. This night out at night.
This official looks just like any 
bright star, except that it moved
and then stopped. It had returned in the same direction
that it had come from.
They might have flown at low height to behind a small town, 
a small town east of Dixon, Ill.
We were in our car watching this
thing. There has been a lot of
activity in this area "sighting". I extended the control over for a fear.
