Text Output:
During the observation period, two bright lights were observed above the beach moving toward the vertical light. These appeared to be about the same size as the original object, but as they joined, there appeared to be three lights to the original object. These lights then left the larger object at times, ranging low over the water, disappearing at times only to reappear. The night was clear with no wind.
Mrs. MacGillvary did call the Coast Guard the next day, reporting that something had disappeared that week. The answer to her question remains unexplained.
The night was clear with no wind. The moon was not seen. Several persons involved, although some parties were involved, said they could hear no sound.
Mr. and Mrs. MacGillvary were both most cooperative and they would be glad to discuss any details in the future if necessary submitted.
