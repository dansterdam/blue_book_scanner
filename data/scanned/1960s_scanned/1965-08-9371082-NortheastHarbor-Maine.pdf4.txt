Sighting at Northeast Harbor, Iaine on August 9, 1965

On August 9, 1965 at about 7:00 PM, Mr. r as sitting near the entrance of his home when he noticed a bright light in the northern sky. The light appeared to be stationary and shining with a blue-white color. This light gradually increased in intensity and also seemed to grow larger in size.

The light remained stationary for about 2 minutes, then it began to move in a straight line, going from north to south at a rather rapid rate, estimated to be about 1,000 mph. As it moved, the light continued to increase in intensity and size. When it reached a point directly overhead, the light seemed to explode or burst, sending out rays of light in all directions. It then diminished in size and intensity as it continued moving to the south, finally disappearing from sight.

The entire sighting lasted about 5 minutes. The object displayed no sound or trail and seemed to be under intelligent control. Mr. r described the phenomenon as definitely not an airplane, helicopter, satellite, or other known object. He was unable to determine the actual size or altitude of the object, but estimated that it was quite large and at a very high altitude.
