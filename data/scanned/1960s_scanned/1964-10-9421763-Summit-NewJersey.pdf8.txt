The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter from the Department of the Air Force regarding "Project Saucer" and the sudden increase in flying saucer reports in 1947.

The text in the document is as follows:

Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.
To Whom It May Concern:

During the fall of 1947, the United States Government "Project Saucer" under the authority of the Air Force due to the sudden rash of flying saucer reports. About two years ago, one saucer was disbanded and another project under another code name was established, "which is still in operation".

During Project Saucer's two years of operation it accumulated some four hundred UFO reports, each one being named numerically and given an account and summary of the findings which is not available to the public.

I realize our government is a very efficient organization, therefore I am led to believe that it is still being carried on of which I am interested in obtaining the files and summaries of cases 33, 144, & 172. If possible, to save both the Air Force unnecessary correspondence, please send any other back summaries. I would also appreciate a copy of the Air Force press release of December 27, 1949 and a copy of the Project Saucer report of 1949.

Trusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience,
Very truly yours,
