Saturn Moves Slower Than Jupiter
This passage, of course, occurs with the 1962 opposition. Toward the end of the evening of July 9, Saturn will be farther from the western horizon than Jupiter. For the rest of the month, as Jupiter moves rapidly westward - setting about 4 hours after the sun - Saturn, moving more slowly, will be trailing it through the evening sky, as they are seen near.
