Dear Sir:

Yesterday, January 4 at approximately 4:35 P.M. an Army aircraft (T-28) was flying over this area and an unusual phenomenon was observed. The aircraft pilot reported seeing a high speed object slightly to the east of the aircraft. This object appeared white or light in color, circular in shape, and was estimated to have been approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. The pilot stated the object appeared to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, estimated at 3,000 to 5,000 mph, and was observed for approximately 5-10 seconds before disappearing from sight.
