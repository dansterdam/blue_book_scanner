The image does not contain any photograph. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the output of all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? IT DID NOT DISAPPEAR. IT SIMPLY SEEMED TO BE FOLLOWING THE MOTION OF THE SUN. BECOMING DIMMER AS THE SUN IS REFLECTED FROM AN AIRPLANE.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound NONE
b. Color SILVER OR WHITE

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? THE ENTIRE OBJECT WAS COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE ENTIRE OBJECT WOULD BE FROM EXACTLY THE SAME ANGULAR SIZE AS THE MATCH HEAD.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
