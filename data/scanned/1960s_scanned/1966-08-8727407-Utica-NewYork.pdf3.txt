TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

TDFTR / Maj H. Quintanilla, Jr/70916/mhs/11 Aug 66

UFO sighting on 3 Aug 66 (CROWN Ltr, 8 Aug 66)

2856th Air Base Group (ATTN: ACORN) MORON/Maj. Quintanilla

1. Reference your letter of 8 August 1966 regarding an observation at Utica, New York. Your report is incomplete and of little value to the analysts and evaluators. Your evaluation of an aircraft, as a helicopter or aircraft and fireworks is too vague.

2. Preparing officers are not following the guidelines established in AFR 200-2. This letter is not complete and does not contain a detailed description of the phenomenon as observed. UFO reports must be complete and comprehensive. Certain New York UFO information requests were impossible to evaluate and also cause embarrassment to USAF UPO Information Program. Please improve the content of your reports.

3. Request you resubmit a report in accordance with AFR 200-2, paragraph 14 and 15 on the 3 August 1966 observation at Utica, New York.
