The charts in this publication are a continuation of the series of Daily Weather Maps published by the Weather Bureau. This publication presents weather information in graphic form. The surface weather maps, upper air maps, and the Daily Press Summary are included. The surface weather maps show the fronts, isobars, and centers of high and low pressure current at the time of observation. The upper air maps show the flow of air at different levels. The Daily Press Summary gives a brief narrative description of the weather over the country.

The Surface Weather Map presents the current surface weather conditions as observed at 7:30 a.m. EST. The fronts, isobars, and centers of high and low pressure are analyzed and plotted on the map.

The Upper Air Charts show the flow of air at the 850 mb (about 5,000 feet), 700 mb (about 10,000 feet), 500 mb (about 18,000 feet), and 300 mb (about 30,000 feet) levels. The contours represent lines of equal height of the pressure surfaces and the wind barbs indicate the direction and speed of the winds. The valid time of these charts is 7:00 a.m. EST.

The Daily Press Summary gives a brief narrative description of the weather over the country during the 24-hour period ending at 7:30 a.m. EST.
