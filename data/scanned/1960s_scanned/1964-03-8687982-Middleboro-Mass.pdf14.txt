This page from the Project Blue Book report does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an illustration or diagram with instructions for a witness to sketch observations of an unidentified aerial object.

The text in the document reads:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" on the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many did you see? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

Until area D in the above drawing there was only one object.
