3. Position Kule and Comments of Preparing Officer:

It can be determined that a sounding balloon was observed in South Dakota just as it was streamed and wind direction given above would indicate that the balloon came from the east-northeast. (Since such a balloon is within normal activity, it should not warrant a change in report or disposition as a result of this report.) It would be feasible that an ARDC test was being undertaken, involving a photo mission, but there is no conclusive evidence for this.

1. Physical Evidence - None.
