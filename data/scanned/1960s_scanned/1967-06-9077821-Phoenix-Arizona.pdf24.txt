10. CONCLUSION
After consider- ation, the investigator decided that he thought the observation was of an object that he could not identify, but should be explained as an known object. The strange thing was that the object appeared to be a meteor, but it remained visible for a much longer period of time than a meteor normally would. It was observed by 3 witnesses.
