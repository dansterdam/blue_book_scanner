Analysis and Conclusions: The first object was described as a large bright light, with changing positions reported, possibly a little lower. However, as it was just above the horizon, it could appear to be in different positions and it was difficult to estimate its altitude. It remained motionless, except for the excessive duration and the apparent location, both of which were a possible explanation for this phenomenon. A second object, smaller and with less luminosity, was reported that may have aided in identifying it.
