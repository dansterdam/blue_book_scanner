The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Upon analyzing the case of 2 October, it is indicated that the objects sighted were definitely appearing and disappearing. It has been stated that the objects were seen to move in a zig-zag pattern and then suddenly disappear. The objects were seen by more than one observer who gave consistent reports as to the appearance and behavior of the objects. It is suggested that a more detailed and objective investigation be made of this case in order to obtain all possible information relating to the objects that were observed. Such an investigation would involve obtaining statements from all the observers, any photographic evidence that may be available, and a detailed study of the area and conditions under which the objects were observed.

With best personal regards.

Sincerely yours,
