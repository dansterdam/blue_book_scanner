"Students claim saucer sighting here

Unidentified flying objects (UFO) could have sped through these parts a lot of through the past few years, if reports of such sightings can be trusted. And, of course, that is exactly what has happened. Wednesday afternoon, a resident of Millersville, Pa., reported that three Penn Manor students, Molly Diffenderfer, Donald Sutter, and Dale Atkins, observed a flying saucer sighting Wednesday between 5 and 5:30 p.m. Miss Adams reported the object was circular, white and flying low, The object appeared suddenly and it disappeared from sight after a few minutes behind some trees behind the Sutter home. The noise came - just a swishing, and it passed from north to south - but it is baffled."
