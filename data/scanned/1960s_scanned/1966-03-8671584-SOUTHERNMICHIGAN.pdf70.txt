I could form a consistent picture of what apparently was observed over the swamp at Dexter and SW at Hillsdale. In both cases

reddish, whitish, and green lights were

reported plus a general yellowish glow. The spectacular

lights, when reported, were stated to be of limited area. One

of the few at Hillsdale described lights in the sky as Christmas

tree lights. Other girls at Hillsdale agreed but stated that a

yellowish glow surrounding and developed the different lights.

The similarity between the Dexter lights and the Hillsdale lights

was striking. Not only as to color and intensity, but motion as

well. The motion was described in both cases as smooth and

slow with a tendency to disappear rather suddenly and reappear

elsewhere. Most observers described a smooth horizontal motion and while

other girls from Hillsdale said the lights seemed to get excited and moved

erratically when car lights and flash lights came into the vicinity, the

major behaviour was described as persistent, smooth and slow.
