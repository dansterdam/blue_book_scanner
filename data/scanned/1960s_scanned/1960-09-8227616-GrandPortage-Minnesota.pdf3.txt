THE FOLLOWING INVESTIGATION REPORT WAS SUBMITTED BY C.3, GRAND PORTAGE, MINNESOTA, ON 9-8-60.

AT 8:15 P.M. ON 9-7-60, WHILE DRIVING ALONE ON U.S. HIGHWAY 61, ABOUT 3 MILES SOUTH OF GRAND PORTAGE, I OBSERVED AN ORANGE-RED GLOW IN THE SKY TO THE NORTHWEST. THINKING IT MIGHT BE A PLANE OR SATELLITE, I SLOWED DOWN AND OBSERVED IT CLOSELY. 

IT WAS NOT MOVING, BUT SEEMED TO BE HOVERING STATIONARY. I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME IT NEITHER INCREASED NOR DECREASED IN SIZE OR BRILLIANCE.

AFTER A WHILE IT SLOWLY FADED FROM VIEW. IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT WITH NO VISIBLE CLOUDS OR HAZE IN THE AREA WHERE I SAW THE OBJECT.

THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECT AND IT SEEMED TO BE AT AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 2,000 TO 3,000 FEET.

I AM SUBMITTING THIS REPORT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE OBJECT I SAW WAS OF AN UNUSUAL OR UNIDENTIFIED NATURE, THOUGH I REALIZE IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOME TYPE OF NATURAL PHENOMENON.
