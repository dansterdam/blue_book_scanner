AFETR PATRICK AFB FLA

OBJECT HAD A YELLOW, GREENISH HALO TYPE GLOW. SO I TURNED INTO THE SITE AREA TO INVESTIGATE BUT WHEN I GOT WITHIN AROUND 100 FEET OF OBJECT IT WENT STRAIGHT UP FOR ABOUT 40 OR 50 FEET AND THEN HEADED STRAIGHT DOWN THE SAND STRIP ROAD, WHICH IS AN ACCESS ROAD FOR A FEW PEOPLE LIVING IN TRAILERS ON THE BEACH. I FOLLOWED THE OBJECT IN MY CAR FOR A DISTANCE OF ABOUT ONE MILE AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 60 MILES PER HOUR, RUN INTO DEEP SAND SO STOPPED AND GOT OUT OF MY CAR AND WATCHED THIS OBJECT DRIFT OUT OF SIGHT FOLLOWING ALONG THE COAST LINE AT NO TIME DID I HEAR ANY NOISE OR SMELL ANY FUMES.
