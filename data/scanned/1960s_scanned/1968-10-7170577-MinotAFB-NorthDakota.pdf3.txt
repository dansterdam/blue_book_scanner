MEMO FOR THE RECORD 
Subject: UFO Observation, Minot AFB, North Dakota, 7 October 1968
At about 1730 hours the FTD Duty Officer called Lt Marron and said that they had a pretty important UFO sighting from Minot AFB. I (Lt Marron) asked him what it was about and he said the only information he had was that the crew of a B-52 had sighted and photographed an UFO and that the Base Commander and Major General Nichols of the 15th Air Force were both interested. I got back to the details as soon as they would allow. They had called Col Hollich, the UFO investigator, 697-1959 ext 3030 or 3231.

I asked him if he wanted immediate reaction from our office and he said no, that he didn't necessarily want us to call him back that night and that our Duty Officer was really more excited than he was. However, since it was such an unusual sighting he wanted to know if we could help him in any way.

I asked him the details of the sighting and he gave them.

At about 0330 hours local, a B-52 that was about 30 miles northwest of Minot AFB and was making practice penetrations sighted an unidentified blip on their radar. Initially the target traveled approximately 15 mile in 3 sec or at about 3,000 mi/hr. After passing from the right to the left of the plane it assumed a position off the left wing of the B-52. The blip stayed off the left wing for approximately 20 miles at which point it broke off. Some photographs were taken. When the target was close to the B-52 neither of the two transmitters in the B-52 would operate properly but when it broke off both returned to normal function.
