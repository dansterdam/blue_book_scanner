Project Blue Book!
Dear Sirs:
I have often to you about the knowledge of Flying Saucers. In
about the middle of February 196B I unexpectedly caught a picture of a UFO on my
picture. I am an amatute astronomer and like to take pictures of stars which are
all time exposures. This one was taken at f/8.8 for about 2 minutes of some constellation which I do not remember. I would appreciate it if you could tell me
approximately what it is. My theory is that it could be a lightning picture but
if it is the one of the most startling over taken. To prove this there are as I
forgot to mention earlier star trails on the negative. Thank You.
Inclosed are **** four enlargements and
one contact print.

Sincerely yours,
