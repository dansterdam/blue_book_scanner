The image contains three sketches or illustrations related to a UFO sighting report. The first sketch shows a curved line on the horizon with an object above it, with instructions to indicate how high the object was above the horizon. The second and third sketches are larger in scale and depict scenes of a landscape, with a person standing in the distance. These appear to be examples of how to draw the position and location of the observed object in relation to the surrounding environment.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position where you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete this larger sketch.
