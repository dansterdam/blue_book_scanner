U. S. AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.
U. S. D. DEPARTMENT

Dear Sirs:

In the summer of 1963 my friend and I, we saw four bright objects which appeared to be disc-like in shape. They were traveling in a straight south-to-north direction at a considerable speed. As we first saw them, they were in front and north of us; and as we watched them, they shifted positions to the east and next to each other. Then they shifted positions again to the east and in a diagonal line. There were a considerable number of these objects in the specific positions as described.

The objects appeared to be highly reflective, shiny and very large. They seemed to be silent as there was no sound detected. They then appeared to simply disappear from sight.

This sighting occurred on Long Island, New York.

I am writing to you to report this sighting, as I feel it may be of interest to your department.

Very truly yours,
[REDACTED]
