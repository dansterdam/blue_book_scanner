RUSSIANS REJECT CHUNK OF METAL OFFERED BY U.S.
American Denies Claim Fragment As Evidence of "Dramatic" Move is Hit
Soviet Official Says Blackened Steel Alloy Is Not From Sputnik
UNITED STATES SPACE AGENCY SAYS:
Chunk Came From Sputnik IV - Satellite Launched on May 15, 1960 and Disintegrated in Atmosphere.
"This does not appear to be from Sputnik V. Moscow declined to accept the chunk as evidence of a "dramatic" move of some kind and said it did not come from the Soviet satellite."
Moscow declined to accept the chunk as evidence of a "dramatic" move of some kind and said it did not come from the Soviet satellite.
Soviet scientists examined the fragment and determined it was not from Sputnik.
"It has not the slightest connection with any Soviet space vehicle," a Soviet spokesman said.
He said the fragment appeared to be a steel alloy, blackened by entry into the atmosphere, but Moscow rejected the American contention that it was part of Sputnik.
The United States Space Agency said the fragment came from Sputnik IV, a satellite launched on May 15, 1960, which disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere.
