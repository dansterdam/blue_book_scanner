Transcribed text from the document:

I went to work on the mid-night shift a local oil refinery, and since I had heard of no disturbances, I decided to continue to work as usual. I was informed by a controller on duty that they were making routine checks of the area to observe any unusual aircraft. He also advised me that traffic of this nature would usually render a conventional aircraft useless.

Upon receiving this information, I decided to be on the alert for any sighting and I feel that my account is fairly accurate to the best of my knowledge.

I have spent three years with the air force and I feel that my account is fairly accurate to the best of my advice.

We would welcome any details or interviews concerning this incident.

Sincerely,
