SAF-OICC/Mrs Cassel/bp/79079/8 Feb 67

FEB - 8 1967

Dear Mr._________:

Reference your sighting of February 2, 1966 on which a photograph was taken and classified unidentified flyingobject.

The additional information received in your letter dated August 16, 1966 has been noted. The enclosures, which you sent, have been considered, but could have been flare or an out-of-focus object, as there is no indication of the size or distance of the object. As for the letter, the camera used was a 35 mm. speed graphic with a normal lens.

As for the report, although a positive identification of the stimulus has not been made, it is unknown that the reports of Mr._________ and yourself differ in many respects concerning the appearance (color) and movement of the object.

It is reported in the earlier photo analysis report, (reference letter of August 2, 1966 from Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson) we are unable to make a positive assessment of the image without the additional information.

I am enclosing the original negative and two prints.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREIMAN, JR.
