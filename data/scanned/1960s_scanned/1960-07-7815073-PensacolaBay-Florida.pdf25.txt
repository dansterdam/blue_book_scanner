1. Reference attached copy of a letter to Department of the Air Force from dated 17 October 1960.

The Red Bluff, California sighting was probably due to the refraction of common objects such as aircraft that were seen in the general area during the period of the sightings. Information received about the general area does not indicate any unusual or reliable for each sighting cannot be determined, it is highly probable that the UFO seen by the highway patrol officers were the planet Mars.

The ATIC flies do not contain any reports of sightings occurring at Boulder, Colorado, 11 August 1960, or at La Grange, Wyoming, 1 July 1960.
