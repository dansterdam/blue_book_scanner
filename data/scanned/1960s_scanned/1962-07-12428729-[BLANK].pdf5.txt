Supporting information indicates the classification of a sighting and not the sighting itself. Since 1950, 184 cases of 3167 are classified and only 4 of the 53 unidentified cases for this period are classified.

The number of foreign reports that have come to our attention do not differ measurably from those originating in the U.S. neither in the presentation of the data nor in the determined probable cause.

The Air Force has no knowledge of a 1948 document by ATIC which states that UFOs are interplanetary space ships. One of the original documents establishing the project states that an objective would be to determine if any evidence from sightings suggests that UFOs are of interplanetary origin. It is possible that the meaning of this document was misinterpreted. The Air Force's open minded attitude still persists, and investigators and analysts have no preconceived notion as to the cause for a sighting but rather form their conclusions from the evidence.

To date no evidence has been found to lead us to even suspect that these objects are interplanetary space ships. Unidentified aerial phenomena constitute only a part of the noise which our defense detection systems must take into account in preventing accidental war. Scientific studies too extensive to be discussed here, are being conducted to determine the extent and nature of this noise for integration into our defensive network.
