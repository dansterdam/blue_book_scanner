SUBJECT: Report of Unknown Flying Object

TO: HQ USAF

THRU: M 7th Bomb Wing (DOOR)

1. An Unknown Flying Object was observed by at least five people at Carswell AFB, Texas on 29 July 1965 at 2030 hours CST. 
2. The UFO flew directly through the CARWELL AFB Control Zone at a low altitude without position lights showing.
3. The UFO was observed to have at least three brilliant flashing white lights observable from outside or astern.
4. The UFO was observed to fly at a constant rate and a constant altitude without evidence of conventional means of propulsion. It was completely silent in flight.
5. The attached statement can be substantiated and corroborated.
6. My qualifications and conclusions are as follows:
a. I am a Command Pilot
b. I am a Major, USAFR
c. I have a Top Secret Clearance

7. This sighting was a positive observation, under ideal circumstances, of a definite object of an unconventional nature, possibly of foreign origin, which could be a threat to national security.

8. It appears to merit consideration for a procedure which will assure positive identification by interceptor aircraft in situations of this kind.
