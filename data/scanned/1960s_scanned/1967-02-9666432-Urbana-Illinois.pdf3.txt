The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text. As per your instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

Intensity, dimming sharply to small size and then returning to a ball of light of approximately the same size and intensity as originally observed. These fluctuations displayed no noticeable periodicity.

To get a clearer view of the object we then went to the roof of the East Chemistry Addition. From this vantage point the object floated above the ground. A commanding view of the surrounding area is available. Again we sighted the object and noted that it was moving slowly to the northeast. At this time it was noted that (1) the full moon was in the southwestern quadrant of the sky and that (2) the wind direction, as estimated by observing the smoke from the University power plant, was approximately southwest. The object was lost from view at 3:13 (CST) just before we left the roof. At that time the weather conditions in the area were noted. The sky was cloudless.

Shortly after returning from the roof I telephoned the University of Illinois Police Department and reported the sighting described above.
