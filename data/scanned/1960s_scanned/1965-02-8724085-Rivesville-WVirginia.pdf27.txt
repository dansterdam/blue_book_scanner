There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated reported UFO sightings in the United States. The text in the document describes a UFO sighting reported by two musicians near Maple Valley, Washington in 1965.

The text states that the two musicians reported seeing two objects that were "erratic in movement" and "seemed to be linked together by some invisible path or force". The objects were described as having a "pulsing dumbbell" shape, and they "moved back and forth across the landscape, then they would rise up and almost disappear from view". The objects then seemed to change color, going from white to green and back to white.

that be and his fellow musician, while
playing their music outside, had seen
two objects at 6:33 p.m. on the list of

The objects traveled in an "erratic
pattern" and "seemed to be linked
together by some invisible path or force".
They would "dumbbell" (pulse), move
