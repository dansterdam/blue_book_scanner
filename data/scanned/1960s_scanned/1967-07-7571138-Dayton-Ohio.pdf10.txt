Transcription of the text from the document:

At 10:20 AM, Sunday, a neighbor called and said there was a strange object in the sky. I went outside to have a look.

There at 10:25 some object or object came up over the tree line in the NE. It appeared to be very large and it was not an airplane, helicopter, or anything I have seen before. It was a very strange object and it seemed to just hover for a few minutes and then start moving away very fast. I called the Dayton Air Force Base and reported what I had seen. They said they had no aircraft in the area at that time.

Later at about 11:50 AM, North of town, a man called and reported the same object. He said it was a very large object and it seemed to be around 10,000 feet and it was just hovering and then it took off at a very high speed and disappeared.

I phoned several people who live around here and they also saw the object. Do you have any idea what this could have been? I would be interested to know if you have had any other reports from this area.
