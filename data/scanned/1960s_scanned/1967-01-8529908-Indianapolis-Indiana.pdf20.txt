The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a schematic diagram and instructions for recording information about a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The diagram appears to be part of a questionnaire or report form for Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

The text in the image is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curve to show the highest point that the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "G" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the course that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" on the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
