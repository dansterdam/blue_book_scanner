Another Disc Near
White Sands
On 29 August 1964, Mr. F. D. Snow
was driving south from Las Cruces, New
Mexico, to his home. As he approached a
change in the road to his left (East) were the
organ Mountains. The time was 11:00 pm.
Snow noticed a large, saucer-shaped
object between him and the mountains.
This object held was at an estimated
altitude of about 3,000 feet and was moving
at a high speed. The object appeared to be
about four miles in size and larger than
a silver dollar held at arm's length.
The object stayed below the peaks as
he observed it from Mesquite Park. New
Mexico, to Mesquite, where the Mountain
Range ends. At this point, the object banked
up and disappeared into a 45 degree angle
up and to the left.
The entire episode was over in
approximately 30 seconds, Mr. Snow
observed the object. The case was reported
the next day to the Air Force, but the man
could provide no further details. The
Green Mountain's Tracking Station at
White Sands Proving Ground had no radar
track on the object.
