Numerous Reports of 'Flashing
Object' in Sky West of Kirksville
The unusual object in the sky 
west of Kirksville observed by 
numerous residents of Kirksville 
today was a weird-looking ob
ject, described as a "flashing 
light," visible for several min
utes.

At least eight area residents 
reported seeing the object be
tween 8 and 8:30 p.m. yesterday. 
The object was seen in the sky
over the Thousand Hills State Park 
area, about six miles west of
Kirksville.

Reports indicated the object
appeared to be "flashing" or "pul
sating" and was moving in a 
west-to-east direction. One wit
ness described it as "a bright 
light, like a star, only larger",
while another said it appeared to
be "an unusual object in the
sky."

Authorities said they received 
reports from a number of wit
nesses who refused to be identi
fied, because they fear they would
be "laughed at."

One woman, who did not wish to
be identified, said she saw the
object about a month after the
first incident reported in Kirks
ville area late last month. She
said the object seemed to be 
heading straight west when she
first observed it, and then turned
and went back east the way it
came.

"We didn't sell anybody to
come, we didn't give anybody to
come, we didn't tell anybody to
come", she said.

"No, I didn't call the sheriff's
office or the Missouri Highway
Patrol. Then it might be taken
more seriously."

Several persons, including 
teachers college students, who
did not wish to be identified, 
reported seeing the object.

It just looked like an odd-shaped
light in the sky, and much larger
than a star," said one witness.
"Several times the light would
grow brighter and then dimmer.
At times it seemed to stand still,
and at other times it would move
rapidly."

The object, according to wit
nesses, was first observed about
five or six blocks west of four
intersections in Kirksville.
"Then it seemed to move off to
the west, and we watched it a
few minutes, while it flashed and
changed position," the witness
said.

The object, the white lights could 
be clearly seen to full the exact 
shape. But a report came in saying
there was an unusual object in the
sky.

"We didn't call anybody, be
cause we didn't want people to 
think we were crazy."

"Now, I, me, too. Then it 
might be taken more seriously."

The 750th Radar Squadron of the
U.S. Air Force, Kirksville base,
was contacted, but they told re
porters they could not comment
on the incident "because of secu-
rity" regulations governing such
reports.
