Dear 

Reference your recent correspondence on your observation of an unidentified flying object.

Without essential information such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, and weather information we are unable to undertake a comprehensive investigation. We wish you had contacted the nearest Air Force installation. Each base has a UFO investigator who is in charge of our better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

The enclosed information on Project Blue Book may be of interest to you. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
