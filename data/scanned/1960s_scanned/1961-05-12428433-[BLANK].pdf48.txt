The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a technical document discussing "Inflatable Structures in Space" and "Orbital Missions". The text on the page outlines various requirements and programs for orbital missions, including "Determine Survival Requirements", "Conduct Test Programs", and "Evaluate Systems and Equipment". Figure 16 appears to show some kind of spacecraft or rocket component, but no human faces are present.
