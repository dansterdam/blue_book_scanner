The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch of a compass and an illustration of the motion of an object or objects. The sketch and illustration are accompanied by text instructions for the observer.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show the direction where the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
