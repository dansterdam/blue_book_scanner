Dear Sir,
This letter, and attached that one I gathered, to groups are moving, or were moved, gigantic objects only 30, 1966 - and I believe were maneuvering at an amazingly high speed.

At about the time of July 31, 1966 I'd seen the first of some of these objects. I photographed one and edged out and it disappeared. I have since talked with others of the community and all of them have seen reports, of people saying they have also seen this phenomena. 
Please them the exact like,
at all of flickered and of a phosphur tone what you're a light of an tremendous size.
Possibly from a submarine coming up with the hollows I came across - Fray, to have WP grain time I thanks name to have.
