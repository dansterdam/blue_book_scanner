UFO Sighting of 15 August 1968, Yellow Springs, Ohio. (Fogg)

Hynek: In one of my recent visits to Wright-Patterson AFB, I came across your sighting of August 15, 1968, and I am quite interested in it, and would like to ask a few questions about the general circumstances that were not covered in the report. How many of you were there actually at the time of the sighting?

Mrs. ___: It was a sort of varied. A wife was first on the scene, then she came in the house and I guess she probably got a glimpse of the object and then my parents went outside some time I came downstairs a little later. So there were actually four people that I know of that saw it at the time.

Hynek: I've found from past experience that, and I've been making observations for a good many years, that the best way to do this is to just ask you to sort of recount the crime, so to speak. Could we all take a deep breath and start in from the beginning. There are a few things I didn't have straight in the report. First of all what sort of a night was it?

Mrs. ___: It was dark. There was no moon, but it was clear.

Hynek: You could see the stars?

Mrs. ___: You could see the stars but no moon. You could mistake the object for the moon doesn't do that kind of performance.

Hynek: What sort of performance did it do? Another thing, there was some inconsistency in the time. One person says 12:45 to 1:30, and another person said 12:30 to 1:00 AM.

Mrs. ___: The one that I have down on mine I know is definitely correct. I looked at the clock when I came in.

Hynek: What was the time on yours?

Mrs. ___: I'll have to look at the report. I filled it out two days after I saw it. I remember it said 12:30 AM. That's what I had down, not whatever else had been around.

Hynek: You say you occupied quite accurately the time of moonrise. The moon was at a certain stage I believed in this area. Now that means that by 12:30 you should have seen the moon and this other object. The reason I ask is that perhaps what you folks saw was the moon, but what I find difficult to figure out is how it could have had some motion that you describe.

Arden: Well, first of all about the moon - I really can't remember if there was a moon or not. I believe there wasn't, but I know there is more to it than was a moon or not. I believe the thing was more to it than what I describe.
