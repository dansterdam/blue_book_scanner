"More Strange Lights Seen in All Sky
Mt Vernon, N.Y. August 5, 1963
About 8:45 p.m. strange lights in the sky over the East Mt Vernon area were observed again. Citizens have begun reporting sightings of UFO's over Mt Vernon, several a week.
One of the lights followed a car travelling in Pelham Manor, Westchester County. The lights were described as round, yellowish in color. They changed intensity suddenly and appeared to change shape. They were also described as hovering and then disappearing suddenly. One description indicated a light detached itself from the main light and moved off swiftly and silently.
The sight again intrigues the public and police forces, as well as the CAA and they are attempting to investigate the phenomena."
