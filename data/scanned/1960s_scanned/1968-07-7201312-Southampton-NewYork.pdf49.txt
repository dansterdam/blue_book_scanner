"Air Fetterman Lment Unidentified Object Mystery

U.S.A. - This report came to us through an eyewitness, Mr. Fetterman of Lament, . We have received many reports from persons in all walks of life who have had close encounters with UFOs. Many area residents were astonished when this strange looking object made several close passes over their homes, sometimes in daylight, sometimes at night. Although no physical traces or material evidence could be obtained, many witnesses, including some professional people, have reported seeing this object hovering low or rushing swiftly past. The description of the object corresponds in many details to those received from other parts of the country. This object was reported to be low, round shaped, give off a pulsating light, and appeared to be half as big as the full moon. At no time was there any noise from the object. Just how many have seen this object is not known, but it is believed that many who saw it did not report it. I shall not attempt to put into words the strange, unknown quality of this experience, as it is simply beyond my power to describe. One wonders just how many such objects are reportedly circling the United States, but are simply not reported. Perhaps all be assumed that there is much more going on than we know."
