The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text discussing the existence of civilizations and their electromagnetic energy output.

Here is the text from the document:

How can the existence of civilizations like ours be discovered? Shklovskiy points out that at least one indication of intelligent activity is available, i.e., the generation of electromagnetic energy by planets which, of course, at stellar distances would merge with their stars. He notes that there are several thousand radio and television stations on the earth, and taking their power into consideration concludes that the brightness temperature of the earth in television wavelengths is some millions of degrees. Moreover, this temperature started rapidly increasing since about 1940. He speculates, therefore, that if a similar situation can be associated with one of the nearest stars it would be prima facie evidence of existence of intelligent life there. He cautions, however, that this possibility requires a long and careful survey of all sources of cosmic origin, something that is not very easy to organize.

Developing the idea of energy criterion, Kardashev points out that the earth civilization is currently utilizing 4 x 10^19 ergs/sec and this quantity is rapidly increasing in an exponential way. By extrapolation he concludes that by the year 5000 A.D. humanity will consume 4 x 10^33 ergs/sec, which is equal to the output of the sun and by the year 8000 A.D. to the energy output of the whole galaxy, that is 4 x 10^44 ergs/sec.
