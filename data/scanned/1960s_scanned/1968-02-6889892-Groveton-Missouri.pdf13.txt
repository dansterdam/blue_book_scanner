SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 9 February 1968

Plattsburgh, Missouri 63077

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office reports no records of an unidentified aerial object from Groveton, Missouri, which occurred on 5 February 1968.

2. The observer sighted an extremely bright light and also heard a noise described as sounding similar to the whine of a piece of wire whirling at high speed above a person's head, and it had a pulsating character, and the sound pulsations were more rapid.

3. Did you recently any reports of unusual objects for this date? We would appreciate your comments as to a possible cause for this sighting.

4. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
