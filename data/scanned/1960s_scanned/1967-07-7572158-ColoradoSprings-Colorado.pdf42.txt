27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object or objects seen appeared above the horizon. If you place the "A" at the top of the curved line, it means the object was high in the sky. If you place it near the bottom, it means the object was close to the horizon. Draw a line from the "A" to the point where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and an "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
