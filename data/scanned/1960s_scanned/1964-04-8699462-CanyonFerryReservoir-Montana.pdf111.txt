October 15, 1964

Dr. J. Allen Hynek

Dear Allen:

We certainly missed you at the I.A.U. this year, but you probably made good use of the time scientifically. Congratulations on what you are doing in building up new observatories, the national and international, and large apertures. I wish I could find some way of producing such equipment for Harvard as a western star.

I'm interested in your comments on the Socorro case. Since I was out of the country at the time, your letter is really the first detailed account that has come to my attention. It certainly looks as if the case is worth shaking the sceptics or making an even more thorough investigation. And I know from inside information that Keyhoe is delighted. He is writing an article for TRUE, which will appear in two parts.

I'd like to know what your basic reaction is. You presented the facts as you obtained them, but you didn't say whether this was shattering your previous conclusion. And you have certainly challenged Lyle and me to look into the matter since you raise some questions from Europe, where the first accounts agreed fairly well with what Lyle and I first heard. I have a feeling we shall try to get together before too long and see what we can work out.

The Air Force, I understand, will supply us all of their material on this case, familiarities as well as the reports from individuals.

It is on to Florence! Best wishes to Minnie and all.

Cordially yours,

Donald H. Menzel
Director
