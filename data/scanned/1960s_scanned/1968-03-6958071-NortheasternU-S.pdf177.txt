MEMO FOR THE RECORD
4 March 1965
Subject: UFO Observation, 3 March 1965  

Mr. [redacted], OHIO, observed an unidentified object last night, 3 March, at 9:45 p.m. Observed it for two minutes or less. There was either one or three objects or lights which were putting off sparks, traveling west to east. He wanted to complete an AF Form 117 and forward it to the office since he was at work and couldn't hear very well over the phone and felt he could better describe his observation on paper.
