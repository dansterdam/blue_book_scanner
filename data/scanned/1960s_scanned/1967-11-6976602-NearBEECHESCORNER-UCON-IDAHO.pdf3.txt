Robert E. Gray

Question: What was the direction and speed of flight?
Answer: It came from the east and disappeared over a field to the west. It approached in a diagonal direction and seemed to be traveling at a steady pace. I would say its speed was about 40 miles per hour.

Question: How did you observe the object, and did you stop your car?
Answer: I observed it from the car window while driving. I would not stop the car. I did not stop the car. I would have if it had landed near.

Question: What was the approximate height from the ground at all times and the distance from you at its nearest point?
Answer: I couldn't guess at the height when I first saw it, but it glided down to about 30 feet off the ground when it passed the highway. The nearest it came to me I would estimate to be about one-half mile distant.

Question: Describe any system of lights and colors you observed.
Answer: Actually, I guess there weren't any definite lights, but the glow seemed bluish-green in color. It seemed to be self-luminous, not reflecting any other source.

Mr. Gray would add nothing more to the incident since the object was in view for only 30 seconds.
