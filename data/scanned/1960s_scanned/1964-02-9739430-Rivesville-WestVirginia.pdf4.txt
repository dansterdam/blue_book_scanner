The image contains a diagram with several sketches and instructions related to UFO sightings. There is a compass-like diagram and an illustration of an unidentified object moving along a path. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine the position of an object in the sky and to draw a picture that shows the motion of the object or objects. There is also a question about whether there was more than one object and instructions to draw a picture showing their arrangement and direction of travel.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you saw an object above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object had risen when you last saw it. Show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the opposite side show how high the object had risen when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
