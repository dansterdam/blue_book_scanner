Narrative:
Watching east down hill on W 12th. St. They noticed in the NE elevation a brilliant orange glow from an object shaped like a nose-cone. On the side it seemed to be a drink ng cup with a drinking straw or a slight wispy fog. Its size was less than a dime held at arm's length. She said it hovered and they watched as long as possible before the boys yelled cresting down the hill. Approximate 7.5 degrees elevation. To be seen now were two big clouds of light or to be on top of the following and the light of a plane going in the sightdirection. It seems to be racing downhill as they lost sight of it heading down.
