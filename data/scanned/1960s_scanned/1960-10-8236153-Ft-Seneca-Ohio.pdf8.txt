There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old document containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

It is not possible to obtain the weather data for the date of this report as this was not requested in the initial report. However, the weather data obtained by the observer, as reported, indicates that the weather was clear at the time of observation. No further consideration of the weather data has been made. 
On view of the observer claim, it is possible to state tentatively that the observed object had the following characteristics: Bright light, round or oval in shape, hovered for about 15-20 minutes, and was first observed at an altitude estimated to be about 1000 feet and later at an estimated altitude of several hundred feet. The observer stated that he observed the object through binoculars and that it appeared to have a metallic surface which reflected the sunlight.
While these data are not conclusive, they suggest that the observed object does not correspond to any known conventional aircraft or other identifiable object. Therefore, the probable cause your object will be tentatively notified.
