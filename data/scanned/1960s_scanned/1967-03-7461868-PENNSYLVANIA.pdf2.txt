Comments- No one was using any drugs which would interfere with NORMAL functioning of the senses. Consumption of alcoholic beverages concerned.
A bright, oblong shaped light above Bald Eagle Ridge extremely stationary
looked like it was covered with a veil or mist. Light was "stationery" as long
as it was watched, which was close to 15 minutes. Light began to flash, very fast, perhaps once or twice a second. At one point, it actually split into two lights, each one appearing at the other end of the original light. The original light did not diminish in size or brightness during this time. After a period of flashing, the light seemed to gather itself back together into one entity. It then began to move very slowly away, altitude remaining the same, but distance increasing.
We kept on traveling. The object seemed stationary but after a little while it appeared to dim. I know for sure that it did not disappear instantaneously like turning off a switch, but rather seemed to gradually fade away. 
We were commenting that it must be a U.F.O. because of the behaviors we observed - stationary, flashing, splitting, and final dimming.
