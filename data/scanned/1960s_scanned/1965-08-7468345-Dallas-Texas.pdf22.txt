DALLAS, TEXAS
4 AUGUST 1955

Observer was out looking for unidentified flying objects when at approximately 2215 hours a dim red object appeared moving due south, straight overhead. The light crossed half of the sky in ten to fifteen seconds. The light, about the size of a bright star, was moving faster than any aircraft the observer had ever observed. The object just disappeared. There was no sound or trail noted. The object wasn't bright enough to be seen clearly.

COMMENTS:
The presented data is characteristic of a meteor, however, no trail or tail was reported. As for being a satellite, balloon or aircraft, the duration and degree of arc through which the object passed discounts such an explanation. Observer has reported two other sightings to the Air Force. As such, with the information available, the case is considered as unidentified by the Air Force.
