The image contains a diagram and some handwritten text, but does not appear to contain any photographs.

The text found in the document is as follows:

"27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the object that shows the highest elevation above the horizon (skyline) and show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline). Please explain the apparent motions and other aerial phenomena that you may have seen."

"28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Please show the path, a "?" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course."

"29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were moving."

The handwritten text in the document reads:

"Went straight up and away, did not hover" 
"did not see it long enough to count how many"
