Reference: Sighting of 23 February 1967 at Fargo, N. D. See Report of 16 March 1967 from Grand Forks AFB, N. D.

On November 14, 1967 I interviewed the two boys concerned in the sighting of 23 February 1967 at breakfast. M--, a student, and the other observer object some - who along with M-- saw the object. 

I was favorably impressed by the boys, who told their story in a straightforward manner. Afterwards, and before dark, I was taken to the site of the sighting, where we found no traces or indications that anything unusual had taken place. 

No color photographs were taken at the time, but I will be furnished if requested.

The boys had been in West Fargo earlier for the purpose, among other things, of answering any questions I might have as to how it happened that they had a Polaroid camera (as reported) and hand why it was that they had it with them that cold February evening. They reported that they were about to turn along the frontage road to a house which they wished to photograph when the object turned and then came towards them, at which time one of them took a picture. They observed the object for a short interval and then said, "Hey, what's that light over there?" to his companion. It was hovering over the ground and seemingly not far away.
