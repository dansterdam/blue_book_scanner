JULY 17, 1964 - FIREBALL SIGHTED
1 On 7/17/64, 1645 hours, a fire-ball type of object was launched. It was successfully carried out. 
ARENS J. SMITH, in Clinton, Ohio, 13 miles SW of Dayton - (15.90 miles to go.)
AT 1646, sighted a "missile-like" object rising and accelerating rapidly. It had a very short exhaust trail. Moving from E to W at about 3 seconds, the object was over in 3-4 seconds. 
ARENS J. SMITH, a regular observer for Project Blue Book, states it was 30 to 30 degrees above the horizon, moving from east to west at about 1880 m.p.h.
AT 1720 hours, Mrs. Eloy JOHN KING, Greenfield, Ohio saw a large white object approaching from the southwest. She claims object stopped and hovered for about 1-2 minutes, then suddenly took off to the northeast at a fast speed. Duration: 2-3 seconds.
Observed: JOHN RUSTIC, over Cleveland, July 17, 1964 (1720?) - Object was 100 to 300 feet long, rectangular in shape, glowing white color, and exploded into red fireballs. 
From the information gathered, it was concluded that this was probably an unusual type of meteor. You heard the word "sporadic" - just like UFOs.
