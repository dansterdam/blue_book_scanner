The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

The text in the document is as follows:

15 CJTI GSCO
THURSDAY
April 7, 1960

Low flying object about 2 to 3 miles above the earth - orbiting in the northeast - at very high speed. He sounds, and radar's a fairly clearly area - The speed was faster than anything I've ever seen! So particular object, like a small rocket. It started close overhead, heads and went to the northeast at very high supersonic speeds.
The man who saw it says it was as follows.

It was supposed to have landed up in December, 1959, but was not sighted.
