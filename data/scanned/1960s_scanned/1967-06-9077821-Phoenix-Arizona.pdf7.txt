The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a letter describing an observation of what the writer believes was a meteor re-entering the atmosphere.

Dear Gentlemen:
On the 17th day of June, 1967, at around 10:00 P.M., I had seen what appeared to be a meteor re-entering the atmosphere. I have seen many meteors before but like this "thing". I saw it enter from the sky, and come at a great speed for five seconds before it disappeared. The strange thing about it was that it's a white light but on and off three times before it disappeared. There was no sign of it after it was gone.
Yours truly,
Age 12?
P.S. Please look into this thoroughly.
