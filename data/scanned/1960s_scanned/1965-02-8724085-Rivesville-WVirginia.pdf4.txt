Moundsville, West Virginia, 6 February 1965 
WITNESS: A retired Air Force pilot who was driving on Highway 7 in Rivesville, West Virginia about 6:40 PM Wednesday, February 6, 1965.
FACTS: The witness was driving south on Highway 7 and saw what he believed to be a low-flying aircraft. He stopped his car and watched as the object moved rapidly, estimating its speed at about 1500 mph. The object appeared to be elongated, with no wings, and had lights around the outer edges. It made no sound.
The witness believes it may have been a "flying saucer" but has no definite explanation, but believes it was some type of unconventional aircraft.

They did not submit any report, as "a significant radiation reading" which can be near the scene. No one else seems to have reported the sighting.
Man Dowden ends the article with: "But one thing seems certain, people the world over, no matter how uninformed they may be on the subject of 'flying saucers' come up, think before you laugh, out loud."
