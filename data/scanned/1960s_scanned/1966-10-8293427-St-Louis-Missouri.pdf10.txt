SUBJECT: Possible UFO Sighting

TO: TDER/UFO (Maj. Quintanilla)

1. Reference is made to the 5 Dec 66 telcon between Maj. Quintanilla (AFSC) and myself (Lt.
2. I informed Maj. Quintanilla that I have four 35 mm slides taken by my father-in-law, Mr. Schlitt, Missouri between 2300 and 2330, 29 October 1966. The following information is transmitted concerning the slides:

a. Slide No. 1 was taken with a 3 minute time exposure.
b. No. 2 - 5 minutes
c. No. 3 - 10 minutes
d. No. 4 - 15 minutes
e. All slides were taken facing slightly North of East with an Exacta camera on tripod.
f. At the time the slides were taken Scott AFB informed Mr. Schlitt that they have a UFO on radar.
g. The planetarium in St. Louis, after having seen the slides and compared them with a star chart, indicated that it was the planet Jupiter.
3. Even though item g above seems to identify the object on the slides, I decided to send them to your office for your information. I assume all of the above information represents very close approximations.
