There does not appear to be any photograph in this image. This appears to be a scanned page of a Project Blue Book document, containing handwritten text describing a sighting of what was perceived as a UFO.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  22 Day - 6 Month - 62 Year
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or its narrative explanation of your sighting:

The thing that was not clearly depicted was that the object was seen which appeared as a bright light, went off and on and traveled across the sky. The periods of illumination were approximately 5-8 seconds apart, and very silent. It had no color and no resemblance whatsoever to an airplane, being much larger and we definitely felt it was a complete missing or not adding of anything around it. There were searchlights in the area that had searching and were not connected to it and were intermittent as the flashing. We are certain it was not a plane because it must have been flying low to get under the cloud cover and yet there was no sound. It was also traveling too rapidly for a plane to sweep an entire sky in that little time. This whole minute caused a good deal of amazement to those seeing it, and especially the people who had come to watch the meteor shower and were awestruck by what they saw.
