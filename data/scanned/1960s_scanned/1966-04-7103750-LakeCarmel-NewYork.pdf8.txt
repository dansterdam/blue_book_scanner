"34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 24 JULY 1966  

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

March 31, 1966 - The night was clear. 
At sunset - I saw an orange - red circular object - lying flat - go very fast Northerly.
Rent cliffs - knowing that. It was at a very high altitude. To me, it was beautiful - like a many faceted gem - But I cannot say it - then a very faint, starlike object - It changed shape - to a bird sail shape - swifter in motion.
And not of earthly design and beautiful - After a few seconds, it disappeared. I looked at it for many seconds - it turned into a pocket object - yellow body and red on it - I cannot change again. It was beautiful. All told, I'm seeing many strange objects - sometimes as many as 6 at one time - the changing of shapes is amazing, and the color is beautiful. Especially whenever they disappear - on back of this page is in order starting with 1 - the things I have seen."
