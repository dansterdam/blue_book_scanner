There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report or document, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR system, I have produced the following text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  1 Day 9 Month 5 Year 66

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

About 7:20 - September 5, 1965 a friend and I were on Gus Road, sitting in the car, when we noticed what appeared to be a bright light in the sky. This light appeared to be larger than a star and was moving rapidly across the sky in a northeasterly direction. The light appeared to have a tail or some type of exhaust and was emitting a very bright light. It was not blinking like an aircraft and was moving much too fast to be a plane. After a few seconds, it disappeared from view. Later that evening at about 10:00 the exact same type object was sighted by my roommate and neighbor in the same area. This object was also moving rapidly and emitting a bright light. It was observed for only a few seconds and then disappeared.
