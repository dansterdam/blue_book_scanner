[Handwritten text] The observed object appeared to be dark or dark colored, approximately 80-100 feet in diameter. It was at an estimated altitude of 2000-2500 feet and seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. At times it appeared to be partly obscured by the cloud cover. I had the impression that it was a craft of some kind. Its outline was not sharply defined, but rather had a hazy or indistinct appearance. I observed it until it disappeared or merged with the clouds and could no longer be seen. The sighting lasted approx. 3-5 minutes. There were no unusual sounds associated with the object and no apparent means of propulsion was visible.
