MEMO FOR THE RECORD
26 Sept. 1967
Called Capt. Tate about clarification of Kinchloe radar report.
He said that he had called Kinchloe and Lt. Leeuwam was to have done it.
Called Lt. Leeuwam at Kinchloe and asked why clarification was not sent. Lt. Leeuwam stated that when they were together the other day, they had discussed that it had seen two UFOs that night, but that there was a total of 17 UFOs tracked all night. Lt. Leeuwam said that there was a total of 17 UFOs tracked on the radar and understanding that this have arisen from the fact that he had said that there was no formation flying to speak of, and that the most that they had on radar at any one time was two, and that these two were not the same ones, but a succession, that these would be the ones both to say and Colorado, although he talked to Colorado the day before yesterday.
