The text output is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" on the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course of the observation.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object in the sky. How much of the object is covered by the match head? If you had performed this test, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

It's just about cover the object

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in detail any common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw.
