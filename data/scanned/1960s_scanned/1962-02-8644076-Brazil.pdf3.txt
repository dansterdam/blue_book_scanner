Winter Stars at Best

This is the time of year covered by the dark sky of the moon - will be in the sky until late Saturday - and so the stars will be most brilliantly visible, especially the winter constellations like Orion, Taurus and Auriga.

After the full moon, the sun will be totally obscured by the moon for a short time on February 5. This will be a total eclipse of the sun, taking place within the Caspian Sea area. The eclipse will last about 2 1/2 minutes. The path of totality will be fairly narrow, so the area for good observation will be restricted.

Along the eclipse track, in the direction of California, the sun will be totally obscured for a maximum of about 2 minutes and 30 seconds. On the East Coast, the eclipse will be only a partial one.
