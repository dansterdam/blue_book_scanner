Colonel Kizer, Ready to go. Okay this was reported to me at 1216 by 15th Hq from Warren. Reported to Warren at 1030 by strike team by Airman Jed Glass Williams and an Airman and chase driving. They were 8 miles west of Delta 8 flight which is approximately 60 miles east northeast of Cheyenne. They were trying to check on an object when they got within 10 miles of it and the road they were on ran out. They did not leave their vehicle to continue on. They were watching this object through binoculars. They report the object was very large with red and white lights. Red to white back to red. The object was on the ground while they were observing it. And while they were watching the object appeared to rise 500 ft. and move off in a northwest direction. They watched it for 10 to 15 minutes through binoculars before it faded out of sight. Another strike team was dispatched out of sight. Okay. Another strike team that was dispatched did not get within 15 miles of the object. And they reported only seeing lights no visible object. That's it. HORAD has this. No. I will pass it.
