CONCLUSIONS
1. No evidence exists to relate the damp areas and the indentations a the beach to the sighting. Considering the indentations, the following conclusions are presented:
a. No object could have made a stable landing without at least some appendages.
b. Sand should have been a lot more compressed for alleged landing.
c. No ground maneuver capability apparent.
d. Portions of ground indentations appear to have been uncovered, but they were totally compressed, as should have been.
e. No definite sign of vehicle departing area in the sand. No evidence of heat blast or sand being disturbed by aerodynamic vehicle.
f. Rough weight calculations indicate a weight of alleged object at approximately 1500 lbs. total weight. This being a static load estimate calculated anticipating a two-legged object.
g. Acrylic resin was present in the large sample taken around the indentation. This was attributed to the acrylic lacquer which was present on the indentations prior to casting the mold.
h. Urine was distinctly present in the soil samples.
2. Both Major Hall and Mr. Parmenter (Erie County Civil Defense) checked for existence of radioactivity. In both cases negative results were obtained.
