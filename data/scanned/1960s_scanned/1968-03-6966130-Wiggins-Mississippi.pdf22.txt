There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically the "Air 30-17(c1)" form. The text on the form appears to be a series of questions and checkboxes related to the observation of a UFO phenomenon, including questions about sightings, equipment used, and physical evidence. I will now proceed to perform OCR (optical character recognition) on the text in the document.
