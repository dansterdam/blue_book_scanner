The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a page from a document with handwritten notes. There is no visual content to describe, as the image is entirely blank. 

Now, acting as an optical character recognition (OCR) system, I will output the text found in the document:

Oct. 1965
Paramedic 12.50
Mileage 21.40
2.5 x 8 = 20.00
1 215 x 40 = 20.00
