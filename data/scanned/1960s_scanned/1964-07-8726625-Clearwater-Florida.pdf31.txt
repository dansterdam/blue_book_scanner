The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a scanned page of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page shows a postal envelope addressed to "Major R. H. Henry, Public Information Officer, Tactical Air Force Base, Tampa, Fla." with a postmark date of "JAN 8 1964".
