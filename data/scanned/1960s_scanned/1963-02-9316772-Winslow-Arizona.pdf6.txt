SAUCERS IN THE NEWS

Blenheim, New Zealand, February 9, 1963. On this date a housewife looked up into the sky and observed what she estimated to be 15 inches in diameter, and they were a similar shape to saucers, but larger than lenticular clouds. At first she could only see two objects, but later she counted six or more. The objects were moving at a steady rate westward and upward, but later they appeared to be moving slowly. Although the witness was not sure, she estimated the object's altitude at 10,000 feet. The witness shows an interested attitude toward this subject and contacted the office of the NICAP New Zealand Newsletter: March-April, via Robert J. Gribble. (Source: NICAP reports.)
