Nos., Australia

CHARLIE BREW, On February 16th, 1963 at approximately 10.00 p.m. he observed a luminous object in the sky to the south-east of his home in Winslow, Arizona. He stated that the object was like a globe of white light and seemed to be about 100 yards in diameter. He said that the object remained stationary for a few minutes, then moved slowly in a northwesterly direction and disappeared. He added that the object seemed to rotate as it moved and made a whooshing sound, according to Mr. Brew.
