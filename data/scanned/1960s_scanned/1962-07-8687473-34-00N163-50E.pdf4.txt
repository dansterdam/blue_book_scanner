No Case (Information Only)
29 July 1962
Lincoln, Wisconsin

On the night of July 29th, the object was seen on and off by many people passing through the   
northwest part of Lincoln. Wisconsin. This object appeared to be of a considerably bright color,   
and at times it appeared to be the size of a car. It would remain stationary for a period of time and   
then occasionally rise higher "to do U-turns" and other unusual motions in the sky.
