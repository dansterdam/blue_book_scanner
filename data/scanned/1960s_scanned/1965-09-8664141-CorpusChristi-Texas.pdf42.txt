Jonestown RD Describe Unio Flying Object

Flying objects hovering just above the tall trees were seen by two families in the vicinity of their home at Jonestown. The two families live about a mile north of Jonestown on Route 22and both saw the strange objects at the same time.

On Saturday evening the objects were heightened as an yellow-orange in color. Mr. and Mrs. Charles S. Martin and Mr. and Mrs. Walter Shuey, who live across the road from the Martins, both watched the strange objects hovering over the top of the high pine trees. 

The objects, according to the observers, did not appear to have any surface markings and were of a definite solid shape. The objects remained stationary for some time. Mrs. Martin said, "they just hovered over the trees and then slowly moved away."

The objects moved at a slow rate of speed and then increased their speed before disappearing from sight. The observers believe the objects were under intelligent control. They said the objects were silent in operation.

MYSTERY IMPRINTS

Small imprints left in the ground were also found in the area where the unidentified flying objects were reported seen on Sunday. The imprints, both round and rectangular, seemed to have been made by the landing of some object ather than human feet. These imprints were found on the other side of the sand pile from where the flying objects were spotted.
