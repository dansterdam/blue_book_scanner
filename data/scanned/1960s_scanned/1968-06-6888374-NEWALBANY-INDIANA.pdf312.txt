DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES JUNE 17-23, 1968

The charts in this publication give continuous observations of the principal charts on the Daily Weather Map. They include the surface weather maps for the 500 mb level, and the Daily 30-mb Charts All of the charts are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are comparable to the maps used in daily weather forecasting by the National Weather Bureau. The symbols used on the Surface Weather Map and the 500 mb Charts are the same as those used regularly on the Daily Weather Maps.
An explanatory sheet is available and may be obtained by writing to the Environmental Science Services Administration, Rockville, Maryland 20852.
The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. The 500 mb Chart presents the height contours of the 500 mb surface-level weather map for that same time. This chart shows the major weather systems and fronts, both of which are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.
The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. EST. The ranges of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.
The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shaded areas the regions that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for this same period. Incomplete data are indicated by "T" which means a trace of precipitation occurred. Dashed lines on the chart show lines of equal precipitation on the previous day.
