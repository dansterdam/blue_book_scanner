Text extracted from the document:

IN THE MORNING OF 16 DECEMBER 1965, WHILE OVER THE PACIFIC OCEAN NEAR JOHNSTON ISLAND, THE CREW OF A USAF METEOROLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT MOVING RAPIDLY ACROSS THEIR FIELD OF VIEW. THE CREW ESTIMATED THE LIGHT WAS APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES DISTANT AND 20,000 FEET ABOVE THEIR AIRCRAFT, WHICH WAS FLYING AT 34,000 FEET. THEY OBSERVED THE LIGHT FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THE CREW STATED THAT THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL AND THEY CONSIDERED IT UNIDENTIFIED.
