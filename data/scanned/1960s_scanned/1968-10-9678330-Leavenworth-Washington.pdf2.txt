about 3 or 5 ball or sphere size and moving so close to the other that chosing between what one they were is uncertain. There were however some testimony that there may be more than three, the exact number could not be counted as they moved so fast in and out among themselves that it was difficult to keep track of them.

The object towards the top of the sky was about 3/5 ball size and moving erratically. The course was determined not to be a star or other normal object - plus the people got this close to it that they could see it was not a star or meteor. There were plumes behind it, suggesting the object had some means of propulsion. The plumes were not a trail, but a part of the object itself. There were others nearby that seemed to come and go, but the exact number was uncertain do to their speed and movement in and out of one another. Plus the people that got this close to them and were trying to observe them couldn't keep track of the exact number - but there were at least 3 or more that seemed to be a part of the entire sighting.
