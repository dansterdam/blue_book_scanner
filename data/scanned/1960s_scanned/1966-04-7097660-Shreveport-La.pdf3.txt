Five Million Have Seen 
Something Up There 
(Continued from page 1)

"real" than believe they are 
figments of the imagination. In 
the Gallup survey, the poll-
takers discovered that while 
this opinion, which 5s per cent
of the population agree with, 
is strong, 98 per cent of the 
people queried have heard of
"flying saucers."

This, of course, does not
mean that every one of these 
people has seen a flying saucer. 
The Gallup organization, in a 
survey conducted almost 30 
years ago, estimated that one
out of every 10 called the 
saucers "a reality." More re-
cently, in a survey conducted 
by the National Geographic 
magazine, it was shown that 
5 per cent or one out of every 
20 Americans believe that fly-
ing saucers are a reality.

The question now arises -- what ex-
planation for this phenomenon of fly-
ing saucers is there? Some, as you 
know, are inclined to accept the re-
ports of Air Force officials. There 
are still others, however, who dis-
agree and prefer to accept the belief 
that flying saucers are a reality of some 
kind. Those who hold this view point 
to various sightings and landings as
evidence to buttress their belief.
