Mysterious Light 
Haunts Couple

There seems to be at least two kinds
of aerial maneuvering lightsâ€”one completely inexplicable from a physical
point of view, and the small maneuvering lights, possibly remote-controlled "objects".

We deal with the former in
this account:

John Horan, 21, a headmaster and
his wife, Diane, 19, have reported their
experiences with a glowing "ghostly" light which appeared mysteriously
in the bedroom of their home in Rabual.
The details are set out in an interview with a reporter for the Evening Post of Auckland, New Zealand. Mr. Horan said that the
light shone through their bedroom
car headlights to have shone through a window. He checked and found no way
the light could have entered.
Mrs. Horan said that the light, "a
globe of light without any center", shone
at intervals in their room between the
hours of 11 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. on 6 February 1964. Mrs. Horan said she felt a
"strange presence" in the room, then
opened her eyes and there was the globe
of light. She looked around and instead of one door, there were two doors.
She looked around and instead of one
door way from the room onto the veranda,
she saw what appeared to be three
doors. She screamed, jumped from the
bed and woke her husband who was
sleeping in another bed a few feet
away. Horan said he woke limited and
his husband stood on end, "I was very frightened for a moment in the face of the
thing," he said.

We present the above mentioned articles and later comments. In answer to
various requests from various members to try to delineate between the
physical and physical airborne light
phenomena.
