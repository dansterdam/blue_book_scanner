DETAILS OF SIAD SEPTEMBER 30
A. F/O FRANKLIN AND C. F. OLIVIER
   At 2345 hours on 30 September 1960 F/O FRANKLIN and C. F. OLIVIER were in the vicinity of Winchester Bay, Oregon when they observed an object in the sky.  The object was approximately 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground and was discernible only in the spotlight which was focused on it.  The object was described as being circular in shape, approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter, and having a bright reddish-orange luminous glow around the outer edge and a dull glowing red center.
   The object was under intelligent control and appeared to be descending toward the men. When it reached an altitude of approximately 500 feet, it suddenly accelerated and climbed out of sight at a tremendous rate of speed.
   It is the opinion of F/O FRANKLIN and C. F. OLIVIER that the object was an unidentified flying object. However, there is a possibility that they could have been seeing a conventional aircraft which was difficult to identify from their vantage point.
