Dear [redacted],
This replies to your recent correspondence regarding your unidentified observation on 1967.
We are unable to make a positive identification without more details. The description you submitted is consistent with observations of satellites; however, without an exact date and time, we do not have sufficient data for evaluation.
If in the future you observe another unidentified flying object (UFO), you should report it to the nearest military installation as soon as possible, while the details will enable them to conduct a prompt and comprehensive investigation.
Sincerely,
BARRETT E. YOUNG
