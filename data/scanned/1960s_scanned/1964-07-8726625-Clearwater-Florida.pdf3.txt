Transcription of the text in the image:

The night was very clear and the moon was bright. I had stepped out on the porch to smoke a cigarette when I noticed a bright light in the sky to the west. At first I thought it might be a jet or plane, but it was moving too slowly and erratically. I called my wife and she also observed the object. It appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a bright bluish-white glow. We watched it for about 15 minutes as it moved silently overhead. At times it seemed to hover and then suddenly accelerate and change direction. The object eventually disappeared from sight, moving off to the north. I have never seen anything like it before and have no idea what it could have been. I am a reasonable, level-headed person and am not prone to seeing things that aren't there. My wife also saw the object and can confirm what I have reported. I am at a loss to explain what we witnessed that night.
