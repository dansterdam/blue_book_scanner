FLYING OBJECTS OVER REARDON, WASHINGTON, JAN. 8, 1961
APPROXIMATELY 5:30 P.M. ON JANUARY 8, 1961, SEVERAL RESIDENTS OF REARDON, WASHINGTON REPORTED SEEING THREE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS IN THE SKY OVER REARDON.

THE OBJECTS WERE DESCRIBED AS BEING ROUND AND METALLIC, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL CAR WHEN SEEN FROM THE GROUND. THEY WERE HOVERING OVER THE AREA FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES, THEN SUDDENLY ACCELERATED OUT OF SIGHT AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

ALL OF THE WITNESSES STATED THAT THE OBJECTS MADE NO SOUND AND APPEARED TO BE UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL. IT IS REPORTED THAT THE OBJECTS CAUSED CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT AMONG THE RESIDENTS OF REARDON, WHO WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE THEM IN THE CLEAR SKY FROM VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN THE TOWN.

THE REARRON TOWN MARSHALL, GUARD AT ATLAS MISSLE SILO, AND SEVERAL OTHER RELIABLE CITIZENS REPORTED HAVING SEEN THE OBJECTS AND STATED THAT THEY WERE OF A VERY UNUSUAL NATURE.
