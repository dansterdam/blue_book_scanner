The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

OBJECT WAS WITHIN THE CLOSEST RANGE.
WE STOPPED ONCE AND TURNED OFF THE CAR ENGINE AND LIGHTS AND IT FLEW OVER US AT WHICH TIME WE HEARD THE SOUND OF IT. WHEN IT PASSED OVER FOR THE FINAL TIME, IT WAS COMING STRAIGHT AT US, AND THEN AS IT FLEW OVER, IT TILTED, AS WE HAVE SHOWN IN THE DRAWING ON PAGE 3, QUESTION #19. WHEN IT PASSED OVER US, THERE WAS NO RADIO INTERFERENCE, AND THERE WAS NO WIND, SUCH AS THERE IS WHEN BEING PASSED BY A SEMI TRUCK.
THERE ARE MANY DETAILS WE COULD FILL IN, FOR ALOT HAPPENED WITHIN THE 55 MINUTES THAT WE WATCHED, CHASED, AND LISTENED TO IT. IF YOU FEEL THAT I HAVE LEFT OUT ANY INFORMATION THAT IS PERTINENT TO THIS SIGHTING, YOU MAY CONTACT ME AT MY HOME, OR THE OTHER PARTY AT HIS HOME. I HOPE THIS WILL HELP YOU, EVEN IF IT'S THE SLIGHTEST BIT.
