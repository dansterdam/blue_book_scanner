Transcribing the text:

VISION BETWEEN SIGHTINGS TWO'S EMPHASIZING CHANGES

ME
"ISN'T IT FUNNY THERE'S
ALWAYS ONE LITTLE CLOUD
FLOATING AROUND AND
ONE SWIFT CLOUDLESS 
SKY."

ME
"FUNNY, THAT'S NOT A
CLOUD - IT MUST BE OUR
VISION OR WEATHER 
BALLOON - WHATEVER
IT IS, IT ISN'T STAYING IN
ONE PLACE TOO LONG."

ME (THOUSAND)
"HONEY, THE THING'S 
SWUNG THE CLEAR
AWAY."

WIFE
"WHEN I GET TO THE COUNTY,
I'M GOING TO ASK FOR JUST
A SHARE OF THAT AND HANG 
IT ON THE WALL - WALK PAST
IT AND SEE IF IT CHANGES
IT AND SEE IF IT CHANGES
AS I WIND ALONG LIKE THIS
ROAD - IT WOULDN'T THAN
IT WOULD."  

ME 
"WELL, THERE IT GOES! LOOK HOW PINK THE TRAIL
IS GETTING - MUST BE BECAUSE THE SUN IS OVER
THE HORIZON - SKY'S GETTING DARKER - LOOK,
THE PINK IS FADING AWAY! - WONDER WHAT IT IS?"

WIFE
"I DON'T KNOW - BUT IT SURE IS INTERESTING - 
IT JUST LIKE A TEAR DROP AT FIRST, WASN'T IT?"

WIFE
"IT LOOKS AWFULLY
LIKE IT'S STANDING
STILL - NOW IT'S
CURVED THE OTHER
WAY."

ME
"HEY, LOOK! SMOKE! I GUESS IT'S JUST THE
SHADOW FROM THE SETTING SUN - SURE IS PRETTY
THOUGH - NOTICE HOW THICK AND WHITE THE SMOKE
OR VAPOR TRAIL IS - AND SEE THE LITTLE WHITE PATCH
FORMED AT THE END OF IT? IT'S ALMOST ABOVE US NOW."

ABOUT A MINUTE INTERRUPTION BY TREES,
THEN WE CAME INTO THE CLEAR AGAIN; 
A BRIGHT LIGHT AND FLARING GAVE US
SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE DARKENING SKY.  

WIFE
"IT'S GETTING LONGER
AND THINNER."

ME
"ISN'T THAT PRETTY - IT'S
EXACTLY HALFWAY BETWEEN
THE HORIZON AND THAT STAR - 
DON'T LOSE IT A MINUTE AGO!"
