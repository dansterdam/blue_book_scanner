The information which has been gathered to date indicates definite sightings of some objects that cannot be satisfactorily explained. Yet, much of the factual evidence regarding observations of the unusual aerial phenomena is far from conclusive. 

At this particular sighting - On 6/25/54 at 9:35 p.m. The witness first sighted an object which was flying at a high elevation and seemed to be moving at a high rate of speed. A light triangular-shaped object was coming from the west toward the observer.  The object has been described as an elongated light, and seemed to be moving in a methodical manner. Its trail portion of the object seemed to shimmer or vibrate in a distinct manner.  The object disappeared into the overhead clouds after several minutes.  Lasting that time the sightings only a short while could then be seen.  After this close encounter, the object disappeared.
