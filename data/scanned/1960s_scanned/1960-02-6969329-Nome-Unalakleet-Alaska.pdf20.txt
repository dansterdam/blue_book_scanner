Direction from the observer: seen from Unalakleet Alaska
Duration of the sighting: estimated to be approximately 120 miles high.
3. The description of this object, the duration of the sighting, and calculated time of the incident led to the conclusion that this object was a meteor.
4. Subsequent to the ATIC conclusion on this case Dr. Christian Elvey, Director of Geophy sics Institute, Alaska University, concluded that the object was a very bright meteor.
5. Other possibilities for the cause of this sighting: 1. ... missiles, satellites, etc. were considered and ruled out due to inconsistencies.
6. ATIC has no information to indicate that any other object was in the area at the time of this sighting, and had no other reports concerning this observation from other sources.
