SUBJECT: UFO REPORT 
ANALYST: T/Sgt MOODY
PI: KINLEY
DATE: 19 JAN 66

This report is in response to Work Order 65-92 submitted by T/Sgt D. N. Moody, USAF/UFO requesting an analysis of a film strip (3 frames) taken in Laos, March 1965, of an alleged UFO.

The photographs show an aerial terrain view with the unidentified object along the lower one-fourth of the frame. A positive identification of the object could not be made utilizing the limited material furnished. It does appear however, that the object photographed was in close range - both to the camera and the aircraft from which the photographs were taken. The left side of the object as viewed in the photographs appears to be draped with some sort of material or cloth, thereby obscuring that portion of the object. The right extremity of the object affords a short range of the object from the camera, together with the image sharpness as compared with the terrain background, and the fact that subject photography was taken from the pilot's window of an aircraft, tends to suggest the following possibilities: The lodge of the object's wings, together with an unidentified object thereon, including the draping, is the object depicted. Additionally the "alleged" pilot tube is merely the visible portion of some part of the aircraft.
