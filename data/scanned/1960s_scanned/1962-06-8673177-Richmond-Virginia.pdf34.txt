a. Flight path
(1) Appeared straight and at constant speed between the two points to the observer.
b. Description of object
(1) Observation was discontinued when vision was blocked by a tree.
2. Duration of Observation
The duration of observation was estimated by the observer to be at least ten minutes, but not more than twenty minutes. No change in object's path was noted.
3. Manner of Observation
The observer first sighted the object by being attracted to a light which seemed brighter than usual. The object was then observed in clear skies with no clouds or atmospheric disturbances. The sighting was initially made with unaided eye and later magnified with field glasses. No sound or other indication of the object's presence was noted.
4. Findings and Conclusions
a. The angle of sightings and bearings were determined by the investigating officer as follows:
(1) The angle of elevation was determined by the observer sighting down the tree through which the object disappeared. This was 5-6 a maximum as taken at the point 2-AA-29a at the station at which the observer remembered sightings. With this information, the angular calculations indicated that the object was at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet above ground level at a distance of about 1 mile from the observer.
b. The tolerances given in the elevations and bearings on sightings indicate that the observers accuracy or memory.
5. Time and Date of Sighting
a. Initial Sighting
1. 9:00 PM EDT, 30 June 1962 to 9:20 PM EDT, 1 July 1962
