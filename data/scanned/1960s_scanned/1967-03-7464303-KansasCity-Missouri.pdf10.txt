The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch and instructions related to the reporting of UFO sightings.

The text from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve of the object where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the start, or "B" at the end of the path, and show the changes in direction during the course.
Moving south very fast up and down

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
