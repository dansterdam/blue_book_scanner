OCCUPATION AND ANY EXPERIENCE WHICH MAY BE PERTINENT: I HAVE SEEN A UFO BEFORE AND I KNOW WHAT I SAW. IT WAS A SPAT WITH IGHTING ON IT AND IT CIRCLED SLOWLY. SOMETIMES IT HOVERED AND SOMETIMES IT MOVED FAST. IT WAS A SIGHTING THAT LASTED OVER 20 MINUTES. MY RELUCTANCE TO COMPLETE THIS HAS BEEN OVERCOME BY THE COLD WAR AND THE FACT THAT I'VE DECIDED TO COME FORWARD. I BEIEVE THOUGHT THIS WAS A CONVENTIONAL TYPE BIG JET WHILE WATCHING IT. IT WAS STEADY AND IT SEEMED VERY HUGE.
25. WHEN AND TO WHOM DID YOU REPORT THAT YOU HAD SIGHTED THIS PHENOMENON?
