The image appears to show a night-time scene of a residential area with houses and other structures, with a bright, luminous object in the sky over the buildings. The object appears to have a long, comet-like tail trailing behind it as it streaks across the sky. This appears to be a photograph of what seems to be a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon.
