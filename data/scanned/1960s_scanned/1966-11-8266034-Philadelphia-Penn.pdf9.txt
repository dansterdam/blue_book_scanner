Received call from Lt/Cmdr WS Trainer, Command Duty Officer and Admin Officer of Willow Grove NAS, Penn to report that he had interviewed a Teleexchange operator due to fact that UFO sightings were not have appropriate APA to forward reports. I took following information from him:

OVAL or sugar shaped lighted object approached at 20' by 12' was observed as he first noticed a high pitched noise on his radio and looked up. The object hovered and descended to approximately 5 feet from his door. A reddish white light from bottom and it being solid and came over and hovered above his automobile for approximately 10 minutes. Although it was raining at the time, the being was not wet nor was the area under the UFOR. It was determined in his interview that he was afraid to looked at the object for being unable to observe moon or stars during event. The being returned to UFO through the light and departed. The duration of the incident was approximately 10-15 minutes on night of 5 Nov 66. Observer reported it to Lt/Cmdr Trainer who called and talked to the individual approximately 45 minutes later. Lt/Cmdr Trainer reported the person seemed to be an intelligent, alert and observant individual. However the observer was not available to ask other questions as listed on the UFO report.
