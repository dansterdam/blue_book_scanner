17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Shape: None
b. Color: Brightest white possible

18. Was it possible to know the angular size - that is, watch stick or arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had confirmed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? (-) it's difficult.

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, fins, exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
