Dear Sir:
On December 14th at approximately 5:30 a radio brilliant flash of blue green and yellowish light, was sighted apparently descending from the general direction of the eastern horizon. The object appeared to be cylindrical in shape and moving at a high rate of speed. It traveled in a northeasterly direction for some 10 to 15 seconds and then seemed to disappear. The total duration of the sighting was approximately 20 seconds. Two separate observers reported the sighting at this location
