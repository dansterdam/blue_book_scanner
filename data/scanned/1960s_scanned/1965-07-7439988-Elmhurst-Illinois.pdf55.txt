EVALUATION:
This was a clear and calm evening. The witness could not determine the size or shape of the object he observed. It was described as being bright and moving rapidly. The witness felt that the object was performing maneuvers which could not be explained as normal aircraft activity. The witness was uncertain as to the nature of the object he observed.
