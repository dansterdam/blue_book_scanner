NIGAP MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING SUBCOMMITTEE
13 Fried Court
Wenhah, Massachusetts

FTD (TDPTR)
Wright-Patterson AFB
Ohio 45433

Gentlemen:

Enclosed for your file and possible distribution to SAFOI and other interested organizations are two reports:
1) Ann, Mass. (8/2/67) again sighting (See Ann detailed report to NICAP)
2) Waldwick, N.J. (8/3/67) sighting. (See attached report to send the complete file).

Both of these sightings were also investigated by the USAF-sponsored university COLORADO PROJECT which called upon the Joint NIGAP-COLORADO PROJECT "Early Warning Coordinator" system of the NICAP, as a courtesy to send the Massachusetts case.

It would be of great value to UFO researchers if local USAF AFB UFO officers could submit detailed sightings reports to the Joint NIGAP-COLORADO PROJECT system rather than to USAF MIlitary/government agencies. This would indicate that the government is giving UFOs serious attention, rather than the usual secrecy and unacknowledged investigation which would normally indicate that the government is not taking the UFO problem seriously.

It is very apparent to me that "Bluebook" is certainly not representative of the true government attitude and functions, which controls investigation, research and lower-echelon military and intelligence personnel. I trust that such steps as a stronger attitude and actions to obtain public information may have "thought-time" for a second look and re-evaluate the facts.

USAF Government public "image" of UFOs and made UFO facts uninterested segment of the scientific community. Colorado is a welcome sign of official transition.

(*) except for Airline Pilot sightings.

Sincerely,
Raymond E. Fowler
Chairman: NIGAP MASS.
