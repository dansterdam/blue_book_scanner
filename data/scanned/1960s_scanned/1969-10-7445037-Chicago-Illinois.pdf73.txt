DESCRIPTION

This unusual report came in from a civilian observer in Chicago, Illinois on October 7, 1969. The witness stated that they observed a bright, disc-shaped object in the sky which appeared to be slowly descending. The object then allegedly released several smaller objects which drifted away. 

No physical evidence or corroborating witness reports were obtained to substantiate the claim. The case was classified as "Insufficient Information" and filed without further analysis.
