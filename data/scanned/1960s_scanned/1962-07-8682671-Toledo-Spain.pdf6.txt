2. Echo I is still in orbit. At 00.17 on 13 July 1962, Echo I was 1076 degrees in elevation, north of Madrid moving southeast. It is possible that this echo was witnessed by Mr. [redacted] and his children as it passed over just before midnight on 23 July 1962; the rocket body fell to Earth on 28 July 1962, disintegrating at about 57 miles altitude. The above information is in reporting the object.
