1. The hour observer sighted the UFO - Wurtsmith Air Force Base was in the process of recovering of the same officer that reported this sighting. The sighting occurred at approximately 2200Z-2300Z, and the recovery was 0650Z. Altitude in pattern is approximately 1,500 feet above ground.
b. Base Sergeant Major. Although the observer was sincere in his report, an object was seen as described, this writer feels there is another logical explanation for this sighting - that being a combination of aurora borealis (northern lights) and swamps gas, the latter being prevalent in this area. This, coupled with a less than adequate observation, may have given the impression of a somthing unusual in the sky.
