The following, extracted from Capt Smith's report dated 28 Feb 61,

"By telcon from AF Warning Center in Washington around 0930: 
Message relayed from RADAR 01/0312. They are picking up fine 
targets around Washington, D.C. area. They are scattered all over, 
moving at high speeds, no discernible trails. Seems to be satellite
