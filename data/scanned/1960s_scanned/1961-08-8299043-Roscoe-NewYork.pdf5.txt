Dear Sirs:

On August 5, 1961, at approximately 10:30 p.m. I observed a strange object in the sky. It appeared to be circular in shape and quite large in size. It had a reddish-orange glow and was hovering silently in the sky. I watched it for several minutes as it moved slowly from the northeast to the east. It then suddenly disappeared. I have never seen anything like this before and would appreciate it if you could investigate this matter further.

Yours truly,
