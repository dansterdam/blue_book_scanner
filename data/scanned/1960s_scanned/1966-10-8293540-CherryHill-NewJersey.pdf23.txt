Dear Sir:

We are answering your letter of March 15, 1967, which accompanied PTD Form 164, relative to the dirigible type aircraft that flew over our car and anchored it's self to the roof of the R.C.A. plant in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. 

We filled out these forms with great detail and enthusiasm, and mailed them back within a couple of days, which has been about two months ago.

We are at this writing asking you for your comprehensive evaluation, that you said would be made upon filling out these reports, as we have become more aware of this dirigible type airship.

We have been enlightened considerably, but we are very interested in your findings about this airship. We would appreciate an early reply.

Yours truly,
Mr. & Mrs. [redacted]
Moorestown, New Jersey 08057
