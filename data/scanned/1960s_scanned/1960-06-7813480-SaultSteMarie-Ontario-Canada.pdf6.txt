UFO Photographs (Mr. -------)
Captain John W. Flanthers (RIO)
Kineheloe Air Force Base, Michigan
1. On 5 May 1961, your office forwarded to ATIC a roll of 35 mm film taken by Mr. --------, Ontario, Canada. This roll of film had frames which showed some type of phenomena of which the witness could not determine its nature.
2. The ATIC conclusion is that the disc-like phenomena is shown on some of the frames and it is conceded that the lens was exposed to direct sunlight. The beeps which was heard by Mr. ----------------- could possibly have been a noise due to some disturbance.
3. Per your request the roll of 35 mm film is forwarded to your office in order that you can return it to Mr. ---------.
