As 2215, 19 Oct 56, I received a call from a Mr. Montgomery, Rt. 3, Montgomery, NY. (phone 3-1475) to report that he had been watching a peculiar object in the sky for 1 1/2 to 2 hcurs local time, He stated that the object was circular, about the size of a basketball at arm's length, and appeared to be a flashing red light going up and down quickly, faster than an airplane. He said the object seemed to hover, then move off at high speed, then move back and forth. He reported that the object was close to his house, about 2 miles west than to the north-east.

Mr. Montgomery stated that he was a member of the CAP. and had reported the above information to his CAP leader, who advised him to make a report to Stewart APB.

I immediately made an informal investigation. Stewart Weather Station, Stewart Tower, and RAPCON Control Tower advised that a helicopter was working in the area prior to the report time, but that the helicopter had returned to base before the report was received. The description of the object as a flashing red light going up and down quickly is consistent with the helicopter's movements and the time that the alleged UFO appeared. On the helicopter's return to base, the pilot reported that the aircraft was operating normally, and nothing unusual was encountered. After completing this approach, the helicopter proceeded to make several other approaches to the landing strip. Weather reported in the vicinity was 25,000 feet scattered, 20 miles visibility. No other UFO sighting were made according to this office.

It is my opinion that the object sighted by Montgomery was in fact the helicopter (his).
