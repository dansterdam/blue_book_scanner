On 13 June 1967 spoke with Mr. Incorp, Minneapolis, area code 612, They have a derelict which was launched the 12th of May and refused to come down. It was last seen going over the Atlantic. Probably went down over the Atlantic but could come around. However, he thinks it went down because it was a 136 ft diameter balloon and had gone down to an estimated 70 ft in diameter when last seen. Balloon carried a payload of four spheres, square about the size of two desks. Mr. Incorp doubts that this is our balloon since it was going down in size over the Atlantic and was not built to go around the earth, though it could happen. He said if it would happen they would be rich and could sell a lot of their balloons.

On 13 June 1967 spoke with Sgt Roland Smith, Detachment #3 APCRL, Ohio, California, area code 916, 313-5011. They have not launched any balloons since early May. Also, all their balloons are accounted for.
