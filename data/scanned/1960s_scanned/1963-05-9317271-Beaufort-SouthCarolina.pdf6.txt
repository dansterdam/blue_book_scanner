Dear Sir:

At the request of your representatives, I am submitting a report of the strange occurrence sighted in the Heavens and having a reasonably good explanation. 

On the evenings of Saturday and Sunday, May 11 and 12, we spend some time aboard our boat, tied to a mooring, looking at the heavens. South of Beaufort, South Carolina, gazing at the Heavens.

On the night of May 13, nearly nine, I could not see object clearly as my eyes were adjusted for darkness. This object seemed to be about third above the western horizon in a west-south-west direction. That it was something more than a star was indicated by the fact that it began changing reflections as though it was surrounded by a revolving shroud or mantle.

We watched this object for about 15 minutes. It seemed to slowly drift across our line of vision, disappearing behind clouds, but its reflective lights remained visible. It did not appear to change its elevation during this observation. 

We would very much like to know what we saw. Can you give us your opinion?

Yours very truly,
[Redacted]

Case No. 10 - Although it may have been an aircraft we feel this is a bad case of insufficient follow-up. We evaluate it, therefore, IF. The youth of the witness and the fact that there was only one witness makes some of us feel that this should not be ranked as a first-class unidentified, but rather as "indeterminate" or "insufficient corroboration."
