UFO form continued
A headline reads "UFO form continued" at the top of the page.

The text of the document is as follows:

"A headlight was sighted carrying just one article in the rear, a light glowed in the venter. It was dusk eo when we saw it, the lights went out suddenly, though it seemed to go up by our observation. We realized that no sound was coming from it as it passed over head and it looked to be about 40-50 feet long,and [sic] maybe 15-20 feet wide. We assume [sic] it was a UFO but can't say for sure. Every time I think about it I get goose pimples, it was that strange a sight. Especially when a steady red light appeared at the underneath as it passed overhead. I think now for your information the matter your [sic] concerning anyone is not concerning us."
