Upon reading news accounts of the reported sighting, Dr. Benniscs called that this investigation should be made promptly, if at all, because the case is still fresh and the investigative opportunity may soon be lost. He wished to establish or rule out nuclear power as a means of propulsion of the observed CTW vehicle. The ITW investigator was asked to inform them of Dr. Benniscs' offer. The investigator stressed the need for collected action and the potential valuable contribution of the representative of the 15th TIW Intelligence Office at MACDILL, FTW requested that the report of completion be furnished to him as desired by Dr. Benniscs.
