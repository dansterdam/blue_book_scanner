The image contains two sketches or illustrations. The first is a compass-style diagram with directional labels and arrows, likely used for indicating the direction of a reported UFO sighting. The second contains two smaller sketches depicting road or landscape scenes, which appear to be examples of how a witness might draw or sketch what they observed during a UFO sighting.

Here is the text output from the document:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "D" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "D" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "D" WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE PATH OF MOTION. INDICATE WHETHER THE PATH WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS SKETCH.
