INITIAL RELEASE: 2 AUG 65, 1538 hours 

Initial study of the majority of reports thus far received by the Air Force indicates that the observations were astronomical in nature. The objects most likely observed were the planet Jupiter and the stars Rigel, Capella, Sirius, and Aldebaran, which are clearly visible in the eastern sky. The time of the reported sightings, the azimuth and elevation of the reported sightings supports this conclusion. In addition, on August 1st and 2nd the temperature distributions and varying wind speeds observed over the Great Plains, from northern Texas to Wyoming, were favorable for the phenomenon known as scintillation. Some of the reports were the typical meteor showers which occur between 25 July to 5 August. The meteors approach from the southeast and streak swiftly across the sky trailing sparks. There has been no confirmation that any of the sightings reported were tracked on radar.
