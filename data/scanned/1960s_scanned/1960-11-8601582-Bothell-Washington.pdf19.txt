The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing text that appears to be a written report or description of a UFO sighting.

I have produced the following output containing all the text found in the document:

I was awakening you with the following information. You will find it very interesting in connection with the attached case.

CASE SUMMARY: JRCOMANN

I am reporting you with the following case which has just come to the attention of this office.

LAST LIGHT ON EVENING OF Nov. 8, 1960 
BOTHELL, WASHINGTON 
...
Approximate direction of object was westerly, approximately one thousand five hundred yards and at an estimated altitude of approximately two thousand feet.
I was unable to see any details of the object due to the poor lighting conditions. The only thing I could ascertain was the presence of a rotating or revolving light which appeared to be very brilliant in nature. The light remained on for approximately 15 minutes, at which time it seemed to wink out and disappear completely. No other lights were observed once the main light disappeared. The night was very cloudy and overcast, so the background was quite dark.
I would estimate the size of the object to be approximately thirty to forty feet in length. The pattern of the light gave the impression of a rotating or revolving action rather than a steady beam or glow.
I am and was completely convinced that what I observed last evening was a completely unidentified flying object. This is the first incident of this nature I have ever encountered, and I am at a loss to even speculate as to the identity or origin of the object observed.
I would appreciate any information or comments your office may have concerning this incident. I am most anxious to learn if there have been any other similar reports from this area, and if so, what conclusions if any have been drawn.
