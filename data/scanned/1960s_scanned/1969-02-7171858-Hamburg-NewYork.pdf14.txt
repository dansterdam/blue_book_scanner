subject: UFO observation, February 1968

Dear Sirs:

In December 1968 I sent you a photograph of a UFO which you were to have evaluated. I am now requesting that my original negative and prints of the air-borne object be returned to me as I have need of them immediately. Thank you very much for your help in this matter.

Sincerely,
