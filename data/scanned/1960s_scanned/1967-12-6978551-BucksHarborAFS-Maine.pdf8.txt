The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

I will now perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document and provide the output:

DECLASSIFIED PER EXECUTIVE ORDER 12356 DEFENSE NUCLEAR AGENCY OWMAND CONTROL SECTION  INDEX CARD CONTROL NO.:  27/ 5a - 00000
SUBJECT:  Reportedi Siting Bucks Harbor APS, Maine - 6 DEC 67
DATE OF REPORT: 6 DEC 67
EVALUATOR: Lt Col Norman E. Steams, Jr.
SUMMARY: SUBJECT was Airman 2C stationed at Bucks Harbor APS, Maine. He reported observing an orange-colored light in the sky at 2000 hours, 6 DEC 67. The light appeared to hover and then suddenly accelerate and disappear out of sight. SUBJECT estimated the object to be about 10-15 feet in diameter. The color was described as a dull orange. It was viewed for 2-3 minutes before it accelerated away at a very high speed and disappeared from view. SUBJECT could not see any lights or shape other than the orange glow. SUBJECT stated that initially the light appeared to hover or remain stationary, then suddenly accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared. Weather was clear at the time of the sighting. No other witnesses were reported.
EVALUATION: This incident, while unidentified, appears to be a sighting of an Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon, possibly a natural phenomenon or an illusion. The lack of additional witnesses and the single source nature of the report limit the reliability of the information obtained. No photographs or physical evidence were recovered. The report is suggestive of a real event, but the evaluation cannot be more definitive due to the limited information available.
