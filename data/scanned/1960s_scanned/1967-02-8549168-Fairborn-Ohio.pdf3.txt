It was late at night, it looked like stars to me, I saw four bright lights in the sky. They seemed to be moving in a circular pattern, there were approximately 60 seconds between each pass. I did not hear any unusual sound. The lights were about the size of a large star. They seemed to just disappear into the distance. I don't know what they were and I can't explain what I saw.
