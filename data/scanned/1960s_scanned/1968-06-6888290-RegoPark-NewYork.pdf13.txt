Rego Park, N.Y.
June 23, 1968

Dear Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.,

I am writing you about a U.F.O. incident that happened to me about 8 months ago. It was a clear day, bright and sunny. I was walking along my alley, when my attention was drawn to a bright shiny object in the sky. It was about 250 ft. in the air, and about 100 ft. away from me. It seemed to just hover there. I could not believe what I was seeing. There was one thing very strange, before it disappeared, it let out a large column of smoke. Would you please write me and tell me what this thing is. Thank You. 

Sincerely yours,
[name redacted]
