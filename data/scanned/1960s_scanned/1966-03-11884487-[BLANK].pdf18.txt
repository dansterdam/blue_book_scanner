SUMMARY OF CURRENT UFO SIGHTING WAVE

The current wave of UFO sightings can be traced back, almost without interruption, to July, 1965. Sightings were reported from every continent during July and then moved to the U.S. in August.

Highlights included photographs taken Aug. 3 in Santa Ana, Calif., and Aug. 8 in Beaver Co., Pa.; the Sept. 3 police sightings in Exeter, N.H. and in Damon, Tex. (both of which are officially listed as "unexplained" by the USAF).

Activity began to pick up in January of this year, following a brief lull. Large numbers of reports came in from New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Throughout this entire period, UFOs have been reported by many persons in eastern Oklahoma. 

The March, 1966, sighting wave began about three weeks ago:
March 8, Chesterton, Ind. --- oblong UFO hovered over service station for 4-5 minutes. Appeared silver, with four projections on top.
March 11, Ringwood, N.J. --- mother Superior of convent saw bright UFO over abandoned mines. Distant light flashed as if signalling.
March 13, Black River Falls, Wis. --- several persons saw UFOs with bright green lights, heard strange beeping sound.
March 14, Southport, Conn. --- three persons saw UFO with domed top and row of red lights pacing their car, then land in front of them.
March 17, Ann Arbor, Mich. --- police saw three UFOs with green and white lights, one of which looked like a top and hovered and maneuvered for three hours.
March 17, Grand Rapids, Mich. --- several persons saw a large, oval UFO with a row of lights or portholes, which made a humming sound.
