Report on UFO Investigation, Kokomo, Indiana, 7/22/66
Investigator: W. T. Powers
General Summary:
Between the hours of about 2210 and 2300, Friday, July 22, 1966, oval patches of white illumination were observed moving very rapidly back and forth within an area over Kokomo, the area gradually shifting southward until the group of lights disappeared behind trees. Some of the lights moved, some remained stationary for varying periods of time. The lights appeared bluish-white, were oval in shape, and shaded off to darkness at the edges "like a flashlight seen in fog."
A total of twelve witnesses gave accounts of the lights; the longest baseline was over seven miles. There was disagreement by four of the witnesses concerning clouds: four claimed that the night was cloudy, while four who observed the longest said it was clear, with stars and moon visible. Four others were uncertain, although their impression had been that the night was overcast.
