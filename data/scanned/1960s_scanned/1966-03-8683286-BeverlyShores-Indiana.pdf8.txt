Dear Sirs -

On March 30, at 5:20 A.M. until 6:30 A.M. I watched what I first thought was an unusual looking star. Changing in the air next to a certain tree about 50 feet east of my home. I had been awakened by a sound and naturally went to the window to look out. I looked at the clock and it was 5:20.

Then looked around at the other stars, but they looked very far away - it was just down.
