SUMMARY OF INFORMATION ON REPORTED UFO SIGHTING AT EVANSTON, ILLINOIS, 12 MAY 61

NO CASE INFO ONLY LAST MONTH WE REPORTED AN EVANSTON, ILL., SIGHTING CONCERNING AN OBJECT OBSERVED ON SPUTNIK IV. LAST MONTH WE REPORTED AN EVANSTON, ILL., SIGHTING CONCERNING AN OBJECT OBSERVED ON SPUTNIK IV. FOLLOWING ECHO E ACROSS THE SKY. WHEN FIRST SEEN, THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT 10Â° TO THE LEFT OF THE MOON AND ABOUT THE SAME APPARENT SIZE. IT APPEARED STATIONARY AND THEN SLOWLY GAINED ALTITUDE AND MOVED TO THE LEFT. DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR MOONWATCH ACTIVITIES AT THE CHICAGO MOONWATCH STATION, TOM COOMBE, TAKING THE STATION'S SPEED TIME REPORT AT THAT MOONWATCH OBSERVATION, CHECKED THE OBJECT AND CONFIRMED IT WAS NOT EARTH SATELLITE OR METEOR. HE LEARNED THAT SOME "STARTLINGLY INGENIOUS MECHANISMS" FAR BEYOND OUR MENTAL POWERS, HE HAS LEARNED, THAT GO INTO THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME APPARENTLY DISAPPEARING AS MYSTERIOUSLY AS THEY ARRIVED. MOONWATCH OBSERVERS LOST CONTACT OF THE OBJECT AS IT REACHED THE HORIZON AND IT WAS GONE. A ROUGH SPEED ESTIMATE AT TWICE THAT OF ECHO J, A MAGNITUDE GUESS OF 0. AND A HEIGHT ESTIMATE OF PERHAPS 150 MILES COULD BE FORMULATED. THIS COULD HAPPEN IN UFO RESEARCH IF PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS AND PUBLIC RESEARCH FACILITIES WOULD WORK TOGETHER.
