DETAILED REPORT
On 25 March 1969 at approximately 2300 hours, a 35-year-old male witness reported observing a large, bright, oval-shaped object moving silently through the sky over Davenport, Iowa. The object was estimated to be approximately 30 feet in length and appeared to be white in color. The witness stated the object moved horizontally for about 3 minutes before disappearing from view. No sound was heard. The weather at the time was clear, with no cloud cover. Project Blue Book has insufficient data to conclusively identify the nature of the reported object.
