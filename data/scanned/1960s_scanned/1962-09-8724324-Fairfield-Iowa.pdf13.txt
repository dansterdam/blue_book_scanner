The first sketch is a curved line with the instructions to "Place on 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it."

The second sketch appears to be a landscape scene with a person walking down a road, with various buildings or structures in the background. The third sketch is a smaller landscape illustration showing a horizon line with hills or mountains in the distance.
