Dear Major Coleman:

I wrote you three months ago in regard to the sight ing and others that I received from your letter, dated in July 5. This sighting data I forwarded to ATIC in accordance with the instructions in your letter. I have received acknowledgment from ATIC of this report, and I wish to thank you.
Would you please send me the conclusion that ATIC has reached as a result of their investigation of the incident? I would appreciate a copy of their final report. Thank you.

Yours truly,
