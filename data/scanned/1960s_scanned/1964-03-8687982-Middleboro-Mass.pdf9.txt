REQUEST FOR UFO INFORMATION

HQ USAF SAFOI PB (Mrs. Gaiser)

1. We have received two complete PID forms 1ch from Mr. and Mrs. A. L. for Middleboro, MA. He has requested an Air Force evaluation on these two sightings.

2. The sightings of 1 March 1964 are evaluated as uninterpreted or conventional objects. The duration of one hour 41 minutes does not substantiate the sightings as unusual objects. No time variation was noted.

3. Regarding the sightings of 5 June 1964, these observations are listed as 4 distinct objects with duration of 1, 5, and 40 seconds. While the fourth object was not described in sufficient detail for analysis, this object is carried as unidentified as insufficient data.
