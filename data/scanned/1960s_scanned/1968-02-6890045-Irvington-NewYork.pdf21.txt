Dear sir,

Material making up the report of the incident at Vashon Island, Washington on February 12 is enclosed. My notes are handwritten essentially as originally written, but typed for easier reading. Samples of water from a molted chip of the ice (photographed for this report and a water sample of the pond in question (taken a week after the incident) will be sent under separate cover.

I will attempt now to summarize the incident and its aftermath in a brief form. Further details and discrepancies in stories of the witnesses can be found in the notes and data accompanying this letter.

Three youths, all between 18 and 19 years old, drove into a gravel pit approximately 1 mile east of the town of Vashon on Vashon Island, Washington between 15:00 and 16:00 am, Sunday morning, February 18, 1968.

They travelled on the access road, through heavy rain, to a point where the road ended in a pond. A "U" turn was made at the edge of the pond and the car was stopped facing north on the access road. (The attached sketch illustrates the scene.)

After the car was stopped, all three witnesses observed a glowing object resting on a hill to the right of the car.
