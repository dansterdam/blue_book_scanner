The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from the "Universite Laval" (Laval University) in Quebec, Canada, discussing the observation of a light moving in the sky in a fashion similar to that of a "shooting star". The text describes the witness's perspective and impressions of the observed phenomenon, including details about the motion, beam of light, and the witness's inability to determine the distance of the object. The text also mentions the witness sharing the experience with others at a motel. Overall, this appears to be a first-hand account or report related to an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

The text of the document is as follows:

THE WHOLE THING LASTED ONLY A FEW SECONDS, 5 OR 6, PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE. THE SPEED WAS ABOUT THAT OF A SHOOTING STAR.

I HAD NEVER SEEN A LIGHT MOVING IN SUCH A FASHION IN THE SKY. THE NEAREST MOVEMENT I KNOW OF WOULD BE THAT OF THE BEAM OF A SEARCHLIGHT IN THE CLOUDS - I MEAN THE END OF THE BEAM, THERE WAS NO SHAFT OF LIGHT IN THIS CASE AS IN THE CASE OF A SEARCHLIGHT. ANOTHER DIFFERENCE: AFTER THE FIRST TURN, WHERE A LITTLE LIGHT APPEARED IN THE MOTION OF THE LIGHT, WHICH LASTED TO THE END.

I THOUGHT THAT THE EXPLANATION OF A SEARCHLIGHT COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE PHENOMENON BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS VISIBLE IN THE DARK SKY AS WELL AS BEFORE (?) A SMALL CLOUD. THINKING ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS, I REALLY COULD NOT TELL WHETHER THE LIGHT HAD PASSED BEHIND OR BEFORE THAT CLOUD, NOR COULD I REMEMBER WHETHER THE LUMINOUS BODY HAD CHANGED WHEN IT WAS BEFORE (OR BEHIND) THE CLOUD. MY IMPRESSION IS THAT I PERCEIVED NO DIFFERENCE SINCE IT IS ONLY WHEN ANALYZING THAT PHENOMENON THAT SUCH A QUESTION WAS RAISED IN MY MIND. I WOULD SAY THAT THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE NEARER THAN A SHOOTING STAR, BUT IT IS HARD TO EVALUATE ITS DISTANCE.

A ROCKET LAUNCHED FROM A SHIP WOULD HAVE HAD THE FLUTTERING MOTION I NOTICED DURING PART OF THE PHENOMENON, BUT IT WOULD NOT, AT LEAST IN MY KNOWLEDGE, MAKE SUCH JERKY TURNS.

I TOLD SOME PEOPLE AT THE MOTEL, WHO LISTENED WITH FRIENDLY INTEREST. I TOLD SOME FRIENDS ON MY RETURN HERE, WHO SAID THAT IF ONLY BADLY I HAD BEEN IN THE NEED OF A VACATION. IT IS TRUE THAT I NEEDED ONE BADLY, BEING VERY PHYSICALLY TIRED AT THE TIME.

THE PHENOMENON WAS CERTAINLY REAL, WHATEVER IT WAS, AND VERY CLEAR. I WAS LOUNGING, MOTIONLESS, WHEN IT STARTED; I JUST LOOKED AT IT WITHOUT MOVING. I WEAR GLASSES AND I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OBJECTS.
