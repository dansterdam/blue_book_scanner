11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers were watching a bright object when a red object appeared above the horizon. The red object disappeared. After a short time, another object was seen later when observers changed position. After red object disappeared, a second rish white object was seen moving in very close to the ground. Then three yellow-orange objects were seen moving very close to the ground, in and out between the yellow objects.
Investigating officer feels that sightings were likely on aircraft flying low in the area and to reflected lights off the haze patches in the area as indicated by the witness statement in two days by the same observer.
