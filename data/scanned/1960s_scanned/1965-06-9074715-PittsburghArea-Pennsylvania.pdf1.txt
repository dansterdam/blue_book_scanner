11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: On 19 June, 1965, a bright object with a smaller object around it was observed for about 20 minutes. The object moved South-East at about 20 mph and disappeared behind some trees. Later, the larger object reappeared and then disappeared again as the observer contacted AFB. This suggests the object was a balloon with attachments.
