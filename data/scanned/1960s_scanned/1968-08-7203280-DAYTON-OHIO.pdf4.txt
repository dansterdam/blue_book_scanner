The observer stated that during the observation a hazy cloud cover moved into the area of observation. The description is consistent with that of a star or planet. The observer sighted a star-like point-source of light. Through binoculars the observer could see regular flashes of red and green. The light was initially seen at 45 degrees elevation and during the observation it remained in the same spot but seemed to drop slightly out of sight.
