Dear_

Reference your recent letter reporting your unusual observation to the Air Force.

A detailed investigation did not reveal a positive identification; however, our analysts were able to uncover a possible solution. The determination was that the object you observed was most likely an air balloon. The Air Force has been plagued lately with many incidents involving large numbers of these balloons which are made from dry cleaning bags with candles attached on a platform for some type of promotional display. It is possible that you observed one of these balloons which are made from dry cleaning bags with candles attached on a platform for some type of promotional display. It is possible that you observed one of these balloons which are more than likely observed at more than one time.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. STENMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
