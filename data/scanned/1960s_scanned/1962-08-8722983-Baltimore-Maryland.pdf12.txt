The image contains three sketches related to UFO sightings. The first sketch shows a curved trajectory of an object, with the instructions to draw a "B" on the curved line to indicate the position of the object when it was first seen. The second and third sketches show larger views of the objects, with the instructions to use the smaller sketches as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

Here is the text I was able to extract from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that the object you drew in the first sketch (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show the position where you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place a "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
