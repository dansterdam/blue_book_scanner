Towards the beginning of the month, we were following up a number of cases some of which were quite puzzling. One young man who reported observing an unidentified aerial phenomenon for several minutes was a very reliable witness, and the details he provided were quite comprehensive. His description included a very large, brilliantly lighted object which hovered silently for some time before accelerating rapidly out of sight. Although his report could not be corroborated by any other witnesses, we could find no reason to doubt his sincerity and the apparent validity of his observations.

Several other reports received during this period also involved intriguing descriptions of unusual aerial objects, but in many instances the witnesses were unable to provide sufficient detail or corroborating evidence to permit a firm conclusion. In a few cases, the reported observations appeared to have plausible explanations in terms of known or identifiable phenomena, but overall the cumulative data received during this interval continued to present a number of perplexing questions.
