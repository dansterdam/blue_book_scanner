The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn illustration. The illustration depicts a UFO-like object with a disc-shaped body and a beam of light shining downward. The document asks the reader to "DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON" and provides instructions on how to estimate the size of the object relative to a known object, such as a street lamp or the moon.

AFR 80-17(CI)
15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT INDICATE SIZE OR LOCATION, SUCH AS REFERENCE POINTS OR VAPOR TRAILS INDICATED BY AN ARROW. THE DRAWING DOES NOT HAVE TO BE ARTISTIC, JUST CLEAR SO THAT WE CAN ANALYZE WHAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED.
16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE WATCH. NOW IF YOU HAD A PENCIL AT THE SAME DISTANCE, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PENCIL LENGTH WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED.
A can only estimate that if I were to hold my entire thumb up at arm's length, no more than 1/4 the height of the object would have been covered.
