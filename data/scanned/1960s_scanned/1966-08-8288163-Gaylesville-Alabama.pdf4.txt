The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that describes a factual observation. The text discusses an object that was observed in the sky, including details about its movement and appearance. However, there is no photograph or image of the observed object included on this page.

Appendix 
Factual Observation:
(12) When the center "object" (light) was in its most forward position (see diagram), it was a brilliant white disc in intensity. The decrease in the intensity of the region where the leading object and the center object overlapped was only a fraction of a second but it was long enough that it was noticeable.

I didn't think that this was important until I was discussing the event with some professors at Georgia Tech. They seemed to think that it could be important. One professor in the Physics Dept. said that this could be important in being polarized and the increase in intensity being caused by interference, however, this would indicate that the "objects" were transparent - possibly gases.
