"STATEMENT OF WITNESS
Shortly after daylight on the morning of Sept. the 3rd 1961, I went to the rear of my home to feed 2 dogs. As I was returning to the house I happened to look up and saw an object in the sky which at first I thought was an airplane. However, as I watched it, I saw that it was no plane but rather some kind of mysterious aircraft. It appeared to be about the size of a small car and was circular in shape and of a bright silver or light metallic color. It was hovering motionless in the sky at an estimated altitude of around 1,000 to 1,500 feet. I watched it for several minutes and it never moved from its position. As I continued to observe it, I noticed that it appeared to be surrounded by a faint halo or glow. Suddenly, without any apparent propulsion or sound, the object took off at a tremendous speed in a horizontal direction and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. I was completely amazed and puzzled by what I had seen.
Description of Object:
(1) No visible means of propulsion.
(2) Circular in shape, approx. 20-25 ft. in diameter.
(3) Bright silver or light metallic color.
(4) Surrounded by a faint halo or glow.
(5) Hovered motionless, then took off at tremendous speed in a horizontal direction and disappeared.
(6) No sound was heard.
