The text on the form describes the observation of a slow-moving object in the sky, which the observer initially thought was an aircraft but could not conclude with certainty. The observer noted that the object had a red light that seemed to pulsate, and that a few seconds after the sighting, the object moved out of the area and could not be seen anymore.
