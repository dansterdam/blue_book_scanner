There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing means of communication with extraterrestrial civilizations. The text discusses various challenges and considerations, such as the problems posed by interstellar travel distances, the potential use of photon rockets, and the limitations of relativistic effects on travel time. The text does not mention or identify any individuals.

MEANS OF COMMUNICATION

Assuming that there are extraterrestrial civilizations willing to communicate, consideration must be given to how this may be accomplished. There are three possible ways of doing this:

(a) Direct contact, that is, interstellar travel, seems to be excluded from serious consideration despite the fact that this mode of communication is the most appealing to human imagination. Even assuming that physiological requirements of inhabitants of various planets are identical, the problem of travel, aggravated by tremendous distances, still remains. The various proposals of photon rockets, etc., (for which DR. STANYUKOVICH is famous in the USSR) taking advantage of the relativity dilatation of time will not be of much use even when they are technically possible. According to SAGAN the flight with acceleration of 10 m/sec2 would allow a trip to the Andromeda galaxy in 28 years so far as the passengers in the rocket are concerned. However, for the home civilization that sent them this would be equivalent to 1.5 million years. A round trip taking three million years is of doubtful value. The information returned may have been made obsolete by better systems developed after the mission departed.
