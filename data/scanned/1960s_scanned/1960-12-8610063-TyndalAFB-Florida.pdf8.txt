"At 1930 hours, 18 December 1960, I spotted the UFO. I called Weather Station and family, also my family. I phoned the Base Weather Station and they also noticed it. I called Christmas and the also noticed it. The UFO seen tonight was similar to the above report. I notified it for 10 minutes.

c. Special Visual Aid: I looked at the UFO with a telescope (approximately 50 power) and it appeared as a very bright star with a very distinct shape. It remained stationary except for a slight movement in the sunlight. It could also be compared with a Christmas sparkler when waved back and forth.

d. Consolidated Reports: Judging from the information gathered, the UFO's seen on the 12, 17 and 18 December could be considered as one report with the exception of the time and dates."
