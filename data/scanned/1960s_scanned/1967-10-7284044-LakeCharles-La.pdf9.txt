There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND SLOW DOWN?
CHANGE COLORS?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE SHAPE?
PLAY TAG WITH STAR?
LAND SAY TO DISAPPEART?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
BRIEFLY BECOME INVISIBLE?
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION?

Had a greenish cylindrical object or shape in the sky. Watched it 3-4 minutes of time. Disappeared suddenly.

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Just disappeared suddenly. Faded out of sight.
