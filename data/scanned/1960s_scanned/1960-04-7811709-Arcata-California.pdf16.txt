There is no photograph present in this scanned document. The image shows a typed text document with handwritten annotations.

The text of the document is as follows:

The telephone operator called by the way, 25 or 30 miles northeast of Arcata, California, but the observer is pretty close, probably a few miles away. My interest in sending you a copy of this report is as follows:

1. Any image, in response thereto and claiming to be an official photo of the object, would be bogus, for no such official photo was taken. The report states that the observer was unable to take a photo.

2. The existence of visibility would be a positive factor in evaluating the reliability of the report. This is just such a case, where the atmosphere was clear and the object visible for some time.

3. The description of the object itself, as given, is of interest. It corresponds fairly closely to numerous reports of similar objects.

In examining the description, I would stress the following:

1. The object was of a definite structured nature, not a simple light source. This is indicated by the statement that its shape appeared "well-defined", and also by the reference to its "apparent size" and "course of flight".

2. The object was estimated to be about the size of a 40-50 ft airliner, as seen from the ground. This is a rather precise estimate of its size.

3. The motion of the object is described as "rapid", and involving both horizontal and vertical movement. The motion, therefore, was not that of a normal aircraft.

4. The color of the object is given as "silvery", suggesting a metallic surface reflecting light.

In summary, this report seems to describe an unusually well-observed instance of an unidentified flying object of significant size and structured appearance, which exhibited highly unusual and rapid flight characteristics. I believe the report is of sufficient reliability and detail to warrant inclusion in any comprehensive review of UFO data.
