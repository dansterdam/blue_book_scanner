The image contains a handwritten diagram or sketch, but no photograph. As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

I was traveling north on U.S. Route 1 at approximately 9:15 p.m. when I first saw the object. It appeared to be a flat, disc-shaped light moving at a high rate of speed. It seemed to change direction and there were flashes of light coming from it. It seemed to be about 500 feet in the air and traveling south.
The object suddenly stopped, hovered and then shot straight up and disappeared. The entire sighting lasted about 30 seconds. The object seemed to be larger than a man, but smaller than a small plane. The light was not steady, but it seemed to pulsate. The light did not shine like a searchlight, but rather glowed. It did not appear to be a meteor or shooting star.
When the object stopped and hovered, I noticed it seemed to be made up of a series of lights around the edge, rather than one solid light. The lights seemed to be blinking or pulsing as it hovered.
