Dear Sir:

About two years ago I bought a book by Donald Keyhoe. It was entitled "Flying Saucers are Real". As many other persons were, I was greatly impressed by this book and by these stories. As a result of these readings, I have become very much interested in the subject of flying saucers. I can about them whenever I can. 

About a year ago I was sitting outside when it happened to notice a very brilliant object in the sky. This object was whatever it had been, it was certainly not a star, the planet, or an airplane. I watched it for some minutes, and it seemed to be hovering. Suddenly, it took off at a terrific rate of speed, disappearing from sight in a very few seconds. This happened in the evening, and it was a very clear night, and I could see the object quite distinctly. I was very much impressed by what I had seen, and I have wondered about it ever since.

This was not the first time I have seen these objects. I have seen other similar objects on several occasions. I have been very careful to mention this to only a few persons, as I know that many people do not take this subject seriously.

I am writing to you to inquire if there is any information that I can obtain regarding these flying objects. I would very much appreciate any information or literature that you can send me on this subject. I shall be most grateful for any help that you can give me.

Sincerely yours,
