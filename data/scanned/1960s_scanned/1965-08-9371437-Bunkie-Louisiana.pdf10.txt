Dear Sir:

Concerning your letter of December 20, 1965, on the subject of reported objects or phenomena, I believe that you have a copy of my report and photos. Due to the nature of the phenomena involved, they could not be photographed any clearer than they were on two nights. As you will learn from my report, these objects seemed to avoid the camera when I attempted to fill out have it. In my reports, which took several hours to complete, I have described the objects in the most orderly and scientific fashion possible, having had the opportunity to observe them well on at least two occasions for a number of hours.

As the relatives, I can not submit the originals for the paranormal and Valentine, Sheriff-If you wish to know anything about the objects that I have observed, either in my report or here, I will be quite willing to talk with your people.

Very truly yours,
