The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, specifically a questionnaire filled out by an individual.

The text from the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 5/21 Day Month 1963 Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

"Circular bright light first noticed over eastern horizon. As it approached, it appeared to be rotating and vibrating up and down, as well as pulsating. Bright enough to light up entire area. When directly overhead, it appeared to be about 12-15 feet in diameter. It then moved off toward the west, gradually disappearing. Estimated time of observation 2-3 minutes. No smoke, no sound, no exhaust was observed. Entire object appeared to be self-luminous. The witness, along with her husband and brother-in-law who were also present, were quite startled by the experience."
