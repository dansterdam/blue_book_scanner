Dear Sir:

With regards to the subject, UFO Observations, 11 November 1967,
a 30-gram balloon with a lighting device was released at approximately 11:30 LST on Nov. 11. This type balloon reaches about 30" in diameter when first inflated with some increase in size at high levels, and travels with the wind at lower levels. Within an hour or so after
release, it would seem very unlikely that any balloon released at Fort Wayne would remain aloft long enough to be observed between Cleveland and Buffalo. 

We know of no other agency launching balloons in this area.

Very truly yours,

Clyde H. Downes
Meteorologist in Charge.
