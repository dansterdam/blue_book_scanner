The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) text output from the image is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Nil
b. Color Grayish white, shaped like football Pear

18. We need to know the angular size of the object compared to the known size of the moon in the sky. What fraction or part of the moon's diameter was covered by the object? If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match? 1/2

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and specifically exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The drawn image shows an oval-shaped object.
