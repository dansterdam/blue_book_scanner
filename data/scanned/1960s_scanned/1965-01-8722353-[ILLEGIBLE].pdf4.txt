Dear Major:

This is in response to a copy of a letter from the 3rd Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force (S-2) dated May 6, 1965, which asked for a report on an incident investigated on January 9, 1965.

I had a long discussion with Dr. J.A. Hynek, our staff astronomer, and I feel that I can give you the full story as we know it, and that I can satisfactorily explain the inconsistencies in the various reports that have been submitted to your office.

We had not seen any large object that this matter was supposed to relate to and that the reports indicated had been observed. The sightings, as far as we are concerned, were of a bright star-like object that was observed for several minutes and which exhibited a pulsating or flickering type of motion. This is not at all unusual and could easily be explained as an astronomical phenomenon. We therefore feel that this case can be classified as an astronomical event and that no further investigation is warranted.

I hope that this report will be satisfactory and that it will clarify the situation. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

J. Allen Hynek
Dearborn Observatory
