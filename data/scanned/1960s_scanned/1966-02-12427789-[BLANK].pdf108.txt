SUBJECT: UFO Recovered at Dover AFB, Delaware

TO: FTD (TDEP) (UPO)

1. Reference Telecon between Sgt Moody and Maj Fernandez on 25 October 1965 in which further information was requested on the identification and return of the balloon.

2. After notifying FTD (UPO) on 21 October 1965 that the object would be
sent to them for identification, we received a phone call from Mr. Robert
Laddie, Washington representative of the G.T.E.Sylvania Co. of Northfield
Minn. From our description, Mr. Laddie identified the object as a test
balloon manufactured by the Echosphere Co. He requested we return the balloon to him as soon as possible since the item was valuable and we did not need it for further identification.

3. On 22 October we received a call from Mr. Bob Long of NASA Operations,
who stated that NASA had launched similar ones manufactured by the Schia-parelli Co. as a check on the data for the 20 October launch conducted the
day before. He stated the only way to be certain of the identification was
to have the balloon delivered to NASA on Monday or Tuesday of the following week.

4. Further information on the return and ownership of the balloon can be
obtained by calling Mr. Bob Long at NASA, Wallops Island Station, VA. Phone
703 (824-3411 ext 2354).
