The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document that includes text describing the Pleiades star cluster and a celestial time table for February.

Text from the document:

three belt stars, is a very famous dark-
irregular, with the shape of a horse's head.
The Cluster is at an extreme distance of
about 380 light years, and shines by reflec-
tion of its own light. while the stars
that around the Pleiades merely re-
fleet the star light falling on it, the re-
markable colors of the associated stars lead to
the conclusion which lend it is
The Pleiades arc relatively cool, as stars
for compared in surface temperature, with the sun.
Their great distance, however, has caused
is much fainter-approximately 6.000 to 
degrees Farenheit-than our sun.
As these stars shine on the hydrogen
the ionization and fluorescence of
The hydrogen is in the invisible ultra-
violet range. As these rays shine on the hydrogen
they excite this gas in the abnormal places
as the hydrogen atoms. Then the electrons
for their normal places, and light
is emitted. This is the process of those
lamps. 
But the color-pictures give indications of
of the near-stars, in which is noticeable of
hydrogen color, familiar to fluorescent lamps.
All that can be seen is the star light reflected
from the clouds of this, and seen in the 
nebulosity or fog, in which it is assumed the
reflected star light, although it is largely
obscured by the fluorescence.
