AT 29,000 FEET. NO SIGHTING WAS MADE. THE C-97 WAS VR AT 4,500 FEET, SAME ALTITUDE AS MEASURED AT THAT TIME FOR THE BEACON MENDENSON, AND PASSED DIRECTLY OVER IT OR INTO IT TWICE WITHOUT VISUAL CONTACT. PART IV. AN ADDITIONAL INTERCEPT ATTEMPT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO DATE, WAS MADE 27 JUN 65, AT 1443Z (23/0945 LOCAL) BY AN ANDERSON AFB RESCUE SQUADRON C-130, CALL SIGN FILE 74, EQUIPPED WITH APS-59. PILOTS WERE CAPT JOE KRAUPKA AND CAPT PETE GLEESON; VERY RELIABLE AND OBJECTIVE OBSERVERS. CONTACT WAS MAINTAINED FOR TWENTY MINUTES AT APPROX 2,000 FEET, AND NUMEROUS INTERCEPTS WERE ATTEMPTED. IT WAS A CLOSE MOONLIT NIGHT WITH SCATTERED CUMULUS AT ABOUT 10,000 FEET. LEVEL WHICH WAS TOO THIN TO PAINT ON THE RADAR. FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT ITEMS WERE REPORTED BY THE FLIGHT CREW: ALFA. THE CREW USED "PENCIL BEAM" ON THEIR APS-59 RADAR, GIVING ACCURATE HOMING CAPABILITY. BRAVO. RADAR CONTRACT MADE RANGED FROM 6-9NM. THE RETURN WAS IN THE FORM OF A NARROW SERIES OF DOTS SUCH AS AN ELECTRICAL IMPULSE WOULD GIVE. IT WAS APPROX ONE NM LONG ON THE SCOPE AND ALWAYS ORIENTED IN LINE WITH THE CENTER OF THE RADAR SCOPE. COCA. VECTORS CALLED BY THE GROUND RADAR
