Dear Sir/

A short time ago I, while teaching a lady teacher of this community, about 2 weeks ago, tell me how this incident moved me to get in touch with your department.

The subject has to do with a UFO which I had sighted about two weeks ago, while traveling a short distance to where I am employed. As the object was close to the ground, it discovered the aircraft of our neighbors. In discovering this object, the startling fact is that it can discover fields, nor a building.

The lady question advised me that your interests may readily confirm this incident, and she assured me to get in touch with you.

A flight of about 5 to 7 minutes of this craft, as it inserts a windshield of sort of yellowish light, suddenly should shoot straight up.

No sound was heard from this craft, and was out of sight in about 2 hours, no draft crossed my line of sight. As described, this craft was a Class of unknown which were published in the press, and described in the classes of unidentified objects which have been described elsewhere.

Possibly the description I have gives of the craft can aid you in identifying such craft. However, you are more than welcome to the above description.

Respectfully yours, I am,
