At approximately 8:13 PM PDT, I observed a bright, silvery object overhead on a south to north course. It appeared to be flying about 300 mph at an altitude between 7-10,000 ft. As it passed overhead, it did not appear to have any wings. It was "I" shaped with the short leg of the "I" pointing straight up and moving in a direction so that the object's long axis was on the front of the craft.

Its apparent size was approximately that of an index finger nail on an extended arm. There was no sign of any exhaust gases or moisture trails and there was no noticeable sound.
