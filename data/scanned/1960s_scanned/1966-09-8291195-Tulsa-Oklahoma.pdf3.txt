It appears to be a letter from the Office of Information of the USAF regarding an observation of an unusual phenomenon that was reported on September 3, 1966. The letter is addressed to Mr. [Redacted] in Tulsa, Oklahoma and is signed by George P. Freeman, Jr., Lt Colonel, USAF, Chief, Civil Branch, Office of Information.

The text of the letter is as follows:

SAF-OICC/hunt/ua/T90T9/215e
SEP 22 1966

Dear Mr. [Redacted]:

Reference is made to your letter of September 3, 1966 concerning your observation of an unusual phenomenon in the night sky on September 3, 1966.

Your sighting has been studied in detail, and it was determined that your observation was probably caused by the re-entry into the atmosphere of the ESSA 1 satellite on September 1, 1966. The description that you provided on September 3 traveling in an ESE direction is consistent with this satellite re-entry. The apparently rapid movement and the illusion of zigzag motion observed by you can be caused by this re-entry, and other observations show that similar illusions are closely related to such re-entry phenomena.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
