LAKE CITY, UTAH
8 OCTOBER 1961
2110 MT
THIS OBJECT WAS SIGHTED 5 MILES NORTH OF SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, BY THE WITNESS, WHO IS AN ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN FOR SEVERAL YEARS WITH THE U. S. AIR FORCE. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED AT 2110 MST AND WAS WATCHED FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE SPHERICAL IN SHAPE, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL, AND HAD A BRILLIANT WHITE GLOW WHICH SEEMED TO CHANGE OR PULSE IN INTENSITY. THE OBJECT MOVED SLOWLY AND SILENTLY ACROSS THE SKY, OCCASIONALLY MAKING ERRATIC MOVEMENTS. AT ONE POINT DURING THE SIGHTING, THE OBJECT CHANGED DIRECTION AND MOVED RAPIDLY TO THE WEST. WHEN IT REACHED THE POINT WHERE IT WAS FIRST OBSERVED, IT RETRACED ITS PATH BACK ACROSS THE SKY AND THEN ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. DURING THE SIGHTING, THE WITNESS CONTINUALLY OBSERVED THE OBJECT THROUGH 7X35 BINOCULARS. WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE CLEAR WITH THE VISIBILITY UNLIMITED.
