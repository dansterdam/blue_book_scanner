The image appears to contain a filled out report form from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation into unidentified flying objects. There is no photograph present in this image, only text and handwritten responses to the questions on the form.

Using an optical character recognition (OCR) system, the text in the image is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes  No   Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes  No   Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Seemed very steady coming of coming & facing object nearly silent
b. Color: Sort of grey with red green & blue lights showing brighter, Dim
 
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? About two inches at arm's length. The total vertical height of the objet appeared to be 200 ft high and about 1 mile apart.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The holes appeared to lights and the object seemed moving at all.
