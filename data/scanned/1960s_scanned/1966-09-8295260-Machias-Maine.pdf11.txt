The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will transcribe all the text found in the document:

Page 7

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 6-7-66
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
[The rest of the text consists of handwritten notes that appear to be a narrative description or explanation of a UFO sighting. It is difficult to make out all the details due to the quality of the image, but the text seems to provide additional information about the sighting that was not covered in the specific points of the questionnaire.]
