Dear Sirs,
On the night of January 6, 1966, I sighted an unusual object in the sky over Utica, N.Y. As I looked out the window shortly after midnight, I caught sight of this object as it passed silently and swiftly across the eastern horizon.
It appeared to be of unusual shape and size, and I thought at first that it might be a falling star or some form of comet, but the fact that it moved in a regular, horizontal path and displayed no luminosity or trail caused me to doubt this conclusion.
It traveled across my field of vision at an extremely high speed, much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. I had only a brief moment to observe it before it disappeared from view.
If the object sighted was indeed a "flying saucer" I must say that it displayed far more speed and maneuverability than any craft I have ever heard described. At my request, I am having this sighting reported through official channels. 
Yours very truly,
John W. Smith, Lt. Col., USAF (Ret.)
