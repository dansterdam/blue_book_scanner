[Handwritten text]: On the night of April 18,1967, at approximately 10:30 p.m., I was looking out of the window of my home in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts, when I noticed a bright light in the sky. It was very bright and seemed to be hovering. As I watched, it moved slowly to the right, then stopped and hovered again. After a short time, it moved slowly to the left and then down. It disappeared from view behind some trees. The light was so bright it seemed to illuminate the trees and houses in the area. I have never seen anything like this before.
