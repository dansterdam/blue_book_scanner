"Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen:
What is the truth about unidentified flying objects? This information, if true, is so important to mankind. Also is it true that two space visitors were found, geographically perfect and Indian in features, west of
a mystic and a grand race spotted here that are not from this planet. We are certain of this because we observed them through our help of motion picture and television.
Yesterday evening at 11:12 I observed three moving slowly towards the east, moving slowly across the sky.
Thank you."
