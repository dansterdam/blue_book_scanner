Dear Mr. 

Your letter of 17 September 1965, addressed to the U.S. Air Force Academy of Sciences, has been referred to this Office.

There was insufficient information concerning the sighting of a flying object to warrant a detailed investigation. Such information as is available will be considered in relation to our continuing study of unidentified aerial phenomena.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Lt. Colonel, USAF
