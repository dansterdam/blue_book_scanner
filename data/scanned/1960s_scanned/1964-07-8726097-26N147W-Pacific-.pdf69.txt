July 17, 1964 11:55 P.M. - A Mr. and Mrs. John Adams, 8726097, 26N147W, sighted an object in the sky over Parma, Ohio. The object was described as "blinking" or "flashing" with a whitish light and was sighted for about 20-30 seconds. It was moving in a straight line and descending slightly.

Its general shape was round, maybe oval. The object moved slowly and seemed to be at a high altitude. No sound was heard.

MRS. MECKEL'S GERMAN EDUCATION

On the day after the sighting Mrs. Meckel called several persons involved in UFO research to report her experience. This led to an interview and investigation by ATIG UFO Center at Dayton, Ohio. (See data). The story received considerable publicity through press, radio, and television. As a result, Mrs. Meckel received an invitation due to her "education" in German (having lived in Germany a number of years) to speak on the subject at sonic club - in the face of her desire to explain "the peculiar" experience at which she and her husband witnessed.
