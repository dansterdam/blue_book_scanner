The image contains a diagram with instructions for drawing the motion of a observed object or objects. There is also a compass-like illustration in the image. However, the image does not contain any photographs.

Transcribed text from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you see at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

2b. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and use an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
