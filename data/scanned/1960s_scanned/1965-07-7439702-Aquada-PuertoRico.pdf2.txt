17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc.; and especially whether trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
