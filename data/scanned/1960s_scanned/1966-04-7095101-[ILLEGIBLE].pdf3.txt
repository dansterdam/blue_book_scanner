The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a memo routing slip from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969.

The text in the document is as follows:

MEMO ROUTING SLIP
TO: Dev Cassel
REMARKS: Mr. [REDACTED] submitted photographs of an alleged UFO. The photographs revealed some kind of object which was thrown into the air and photographed while on fire. Lt Col [REDACTED] has written to President Johnson, Senator [REDACTED], and Project Blue Book, requesting that we send a letter to this fellow and have him get off our backs. I have included the last group of photos. There is no need to send these to photo analysis.
