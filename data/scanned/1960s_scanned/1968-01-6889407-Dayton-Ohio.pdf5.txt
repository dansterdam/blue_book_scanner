This appears to be a scanned image of a handwritten document, likely related to a UFO report. The text describes the witness's observation of an object that appeared suddenly and passed through the glass, with a blurred and moving effect. The witness hopes the pictures provided will give some idea, though they may not be the same as the witness's experience. The postscript indicates the witness prefers their name and location not be published if the content is to be published.
