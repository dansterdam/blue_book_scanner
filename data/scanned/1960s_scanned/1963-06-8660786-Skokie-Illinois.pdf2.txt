Dear Sir:

I was on the Edens Highway between Skokie and Highland Park, Illinois at approximately 9:30 when I saw a very brightly lit rotating object at about 2,000 feet high which had brightly lit up portions of the way around it. I would like to know if you can tell me what this object was?

I am 11 years old and my father, 15 year old bro

Thank you very much for your trouble.
