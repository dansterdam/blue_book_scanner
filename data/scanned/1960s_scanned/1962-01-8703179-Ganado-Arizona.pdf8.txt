The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and another curved line labeled "B" to illustrate how high the observed object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows a larger scene with a person standing on a road, with a curved horizon in the distance, illustrating how the object appeared to the observer.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
