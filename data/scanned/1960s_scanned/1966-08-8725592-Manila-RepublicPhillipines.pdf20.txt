STATEMENT

On 1 Aug 66 while enroute to a storm reconnaissance area in the South China Sea, our navigator noticed that persons was tracking our aircraft on radar. While looking at this time, several lights were sighted (approximate 5 to 8 lights) closing to our position. These lights were observed to be moving in the opposite direction as our aircraft. There were 3 lights in a triangle formation and 2 others were in a straight line formation. The group of 3 lights was slightly lower in altitude than the 2 lights. I believe I was the last to see them as they disappeared behind our plane.
While watching the lights for some period of time, another group guide a hill as the first seen. As an aircraft, this was the first time I have ever seen anything like this formation with the load being as the lights. About fifteen (15) minutes before resuming our primary mission. At this time the navigator advised me that the original lights had decided they.
While scanning all around the aircraft for anymore possible sightings I saw 2 bright strobe lights which held almost a steady formation. I could also distinguish a hazy object but inability to identify him. He turned the aircraft far enough to the right to see this hazy object again but decided they moved off at a high rate of speed.
