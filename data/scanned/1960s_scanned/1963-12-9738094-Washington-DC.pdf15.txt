The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten report or questionnaire. The document appears to be on a page from a Project Blue Book file, with the filename indicating it is from 1963.

The text in the document is as follows:

34. Data you completed this questionnaire: 15 January 1963

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I WAS DRIVING AND TRAFFIC COULD NOT WATCH THE SUBJECT CONTINUOUSLY. MY WIFE, HOWEVER, DID SEE AND WAS OBSERVING IT FOR SOME TIME. IT SEEMED TO BE STATIONARY UNTIL IT TOOK OFF AT A TREMENDOUS RATE OF SPEED THAT SEEMED ALMOST BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF KNOWN AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE. IT APPEARED TO BE MUCH FASTER THAN OUR CONTEMPORARY JETS.
