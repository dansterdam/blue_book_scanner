35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points as discussed. My 12 year old son, called Ronnie, came home a week ago. He was out in the backyard with friends playing ball. He ran in the house very excited and said he saw a strange light in the sky which changed colors. He quickly called George, my neighbor, to come and see it. George said it looked very bright and changed colors from red to green to blue. He watched it for about 10 minutes. After that it sort of flashed or grew brighter and then went out of sight quickly. We watched for it again but did not see it return. My son was very excited and wanted to know what it was. I told him I did not know but it sounded like some kind of unidentified flying object. He seemed satisfied with this explanation. We have not seen the object again.
