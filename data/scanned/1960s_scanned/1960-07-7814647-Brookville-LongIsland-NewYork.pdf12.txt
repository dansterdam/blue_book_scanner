The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a handwritten document or report. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

Great Neck, L.I.
regarding an observation of 3:15 P.M. on May 30, 1960. 
Three distinct objects passing in a southeasterly direction at a very great speed. Objects appeared to be about 150 ft in diameter and were traveling from east to west at an estimated speed of 1,500 to 2,000 mph. They kept a constant formation and disappeared from view in about 1 to 2 minutes.
The observations. The size and form of the three objects were round or circular in shape and kept in a constant formation as they passed. As the objects continued to move, their speed seemed to increase and they disappeared from view.
There was no sound of any kind and they were going in a very straight direction, seemingly very far in the distance.
One said it was mother of the moon. Didn't cloud a particularly photograph. It was impossible for me to get the binoculars, but I would say this were very unusual objects and not any known type of aircraft. On said the objects were traveling very swiftly, my eyes had hardly time to follow them, so fast they were moving.
