Text from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or man's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, it seemed to fade away.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
Strange very bright light, rapidly changing in size and brightness.
