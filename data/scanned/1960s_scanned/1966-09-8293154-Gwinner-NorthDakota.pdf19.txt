MEMORANDUM FOR: Project Blue Book
FROM: Captain George Gregory
LOCATION: Rural North Dakota
SIGHTING DATE: 1 September 1966

On 1 September 1966, at approximately 1845 hours, I received a report of a possible UFO sighting in a rural area near Gwinner, North Dakota. I immediately drove to the location and interviewed the witness, Mr. Clyde Gwinner.

Mr. Gwinner reported that while he was working in his field, he observed a strange object in the sky that appeared to be hovering and emitting a bright light. He stated the object was circular in shape and approximately 50 feet in diameter. The object hovered for several minutes before quickly accelerating and disappearing from view.

I conducted a thorough investigation of the area and found no evidence of any unusual activity or physical traces. Mr. Gwinner's report appears to be credible, and he has no history of making false claims. However, without any physical evidence or additional witnesses, I am unable to determine the nature of the object he observed.

I have included a photograph taken at the site of the sighting. Please review and advise if you require any further information.

Sincerely,
Captain George Gregory
