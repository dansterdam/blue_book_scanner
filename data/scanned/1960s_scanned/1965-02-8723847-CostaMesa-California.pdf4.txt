SUBJECT: Extract from Staff Duty Officer's Report 15 Feb 65

TO: ESQDL

The following was extracted from the BSD Staff Duty Officer's Report for the period 1500 13 FEB 65 to 0900 15 FEB 65:

At 2315, a [redacted] St, Costa Mesa called reporting that he and his wife had observed a strange light in the sky. He described the light as pulsating, changing color from red to green, to white, and back again. The light seemed to move very rapidly and then would hover. The informant stated that the light was about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. He further stated that the light appeared to be approximately 13,000 to 15,000 feet in altitude. The light source in addition to pulsing, seemed to emit a light beam that would turn and shine directly in their faces with the light source seemingly falling to the ground. Witnesses became alarmed and left their house and the light source as they carried. The source seemed to be a ground location and was so bright it hurt their eyes. 

Husband is a Navy enlisted man at San Diego and advised her to contact authorities. She reported the incident to the FM who gave her in touch with the ATIC (AFSC)(OSI?) at Norton AFB. Arrangements were made to have the witnesses immediately called back. Request necessary action be taken to have them called back. (See note on file no. 68-59 - 1815) Her number at work is [redacted].
