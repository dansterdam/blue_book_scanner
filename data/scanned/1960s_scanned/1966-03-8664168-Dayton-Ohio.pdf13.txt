The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text and a hand-drawn sketch.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Appeared to disappear because of distance.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what: No information provided.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what: No information provided.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Bright sound
b. Color: White

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match? Partially would have covered the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. The hand-drawn sketch shows a circular shape with some contours around the edge, indicating the direction of movement with an arrow.
