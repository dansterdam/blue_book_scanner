The image contains three sketches. The first sketch on the top shows a curved line with an object above the horizon line. The second sketch in the middle shows a landscape with a road in the foreground and buildings in the background. The third sketch on the bottom shows a landscape with mountains in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object we showed the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object (skyline) was when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
