The text output is as follows:

At 0823 GMT I noted another object high to the West and moving. It moved North-ward, and I could see it through my binoculars the same changing colored lights that characterized the first object. At 0914 GMT I was convinced that it was the same object I had seen earlier. This information was reported to the Officer of the Day at Dobbins Air Force Base.

At 0905 GMT I obtained a definite clinometer reading which was 30 degrees above the horizon. This was moving object located approximately 70 degrees East of North.

At 0930 GMT broken clouds blocked further view of the unidentified flying objects.

On July 27, 1966 at 0540 GMT I observed through binoculars a semi-stationary light in the sky. It appeared to be pulsating, and was giving off red, white and blue colors. The light appeared to be a bright blue glow and was noted on surrounding stars. At 0630 GMT I saw a bright light give off a flash of red and green. It appeared to be a large, semi-circular shaped object and emanated this blue slow glow noticed on surrounding stars.

At 0835 GMT I saw a large bright light on the horizon to the East. It appeared to be rising slowly. At 0905 GMT the above bright light, regarded by some as the moon, was measured and found to be 15 degrees above the horizon. At 1026 GMT this same light measured 20 degrees above the horizon. At 1045 GMT this light had dimmed but flashed a brilliant blue-green color and then faded. The colors appeared to be changing rapidly; in each instance, the colors appeared to be changing rapidly.
