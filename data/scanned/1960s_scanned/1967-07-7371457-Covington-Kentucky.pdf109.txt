Optical character recognition (OCR) of the text in the document:

We were fishing when a bright pinpoint of light caught our eyes. It drew rapidly towards us, traveling at a high rate of speed in a southeastward direction. As it neared, we observed that it was a small but very bright object, round in shape. It seemed to be maneuvering at random, not following any apparent course. It then disappeared over a mountain.
