There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document containing a questionnaire or report form.

The text from the document is as follows:

17. DID YOU OBSERVE THE PHENOMENON THROUGH ANY OF THE FOLLOWING? INCLUDE INFORMATION ON MODEL, TYPE, FILTER, LENS DESCRIPTION OR OTHER APPLICABLE DATA:
EYEGLASSES
BINOCULARS
WINDOW
SIDE WINDOW OF VEHICLE
WINDSHIELD
OTHER

18. HAVE YOU EVER OBSERVED SIMILAR PHENOMENA BEFORE? YES NO

19. IN ORDER THAT WE MAY OBTAIN AS CLEAR A PICTURE AS POSSIBLE OF WHAT YOU SAW, DESCRIBE IN YOUR OWN WORDS WHAT YOU OBSERVED. THIS SHOULD INCLUDE INFORMATION ON SIZE, SHAPE, COLOR, BRIGHTNESS, SOUND, SPEED OF OBJECT OR PHENOMENON, DIRECTION, DURATION AND ALTITUDE. RELATE IT TO COMMON OBJECTS AND WHAT YOU SAW.

The last section contains a handwritten response describing the observed phenomenon.
