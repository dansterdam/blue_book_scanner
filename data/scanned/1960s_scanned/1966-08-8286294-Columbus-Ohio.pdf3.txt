Transcribed text from the document:

Major Quintanilla Page 2 3 November 1966

From your office, I believe, would be more effective than one from Northwestern University in view of the recipient's local address. I would suggest that the letter be addressed to the editors of the Columbus Citizen and Columbus Dispatch, asking them to make the information about this lighting appear in their newspapers. This would result in a larger circulation and wider local coverage of the incident.

The original object seemed to be like a big star but appeared to have a definite disk to it. Mrs. Quintanilla's description indicates that he even thought that the center was a little darker than the luminous wings. The central object was under observation for better than 15 minutes before it disappeared.

It is an odd sighting in that it doesn't fit any general pattern, but I am satisfied that Mrs. Quintanilla's testimony is valid. I don't believe that it appeared to be an explosion or a disintegration but rather an expulsion of five objects that moved individually out from the central object and at a low altitude.

I believe this covers the sighting unless you are able to get further reports from other sources.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
