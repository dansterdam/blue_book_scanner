Dear Allen,

I am returning the letters from Torbett Davis to you. We have forwarded a copy of the 6 May letter indicating per your request that we make no further analysis of the 25 May Cambridge, Mass sighting. Torbett Davis has attached (7?) a house in his present and would appreciate your analysis at your earliest convenience in order that we may be able to reply to the observer.

Sincerely,
