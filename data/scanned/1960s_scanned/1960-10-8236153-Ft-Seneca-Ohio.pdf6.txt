Performing OCR on the text in the image:

The object viewed by the witness was possibly a complete disk, about the size of a small plane, with brilliant white lights on the bottom, possibly of a pulsatile nature, and it appeared to be approximately five hundred feet above the ground and was traveling in a northerly direction at moderate speed. 

It has been impossible to obtain the weather data for the location and time of the sighting. The witness first observed the object at approximately 8:30 PM on 17 August 1960 and it was visible for approximately 2 minutes.  The witness could not obtain any photographs. Further consideration of this sighting is not considered necessary as the information received is not sufficient to warrant any additional action.
