Text extracted from the document:

"next morning and drove off to Boone, North Carolina. He said he had breakfast with my son and thought he would never wake up. I told him about what I had said about the incident, but he just listened, seeming to wonder.

He then caught up with me and said that while driving home through Lenoir City, he caught a glimpse of something in the sky that didn't appear quite right. He apparently was so startled that he nearly drove off the road. He said it was just a quick flash and they were gone. But it was cloudy and raining, and there would have been no chance for good observation or identification.

Somebody, if you know anyone the collects information on "UFO" sightings, she would be interested in this type of information. And might even have some suggestions as to how I could identify what I saw - if she had adequate descriptions of speed, height, etc. I don't know what it was, but it was certainly not anything like a conventional aircraft.

I'd like to take you and "___" to dinner some night when you're free - I'll get in touch with you again.

Yours,

P.S. Thanks for "Ordeal of Change". I've become a real fan. See you soon."
