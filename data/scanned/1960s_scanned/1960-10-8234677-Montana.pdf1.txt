The object was very bright and appeared to give off light. There was no noise or trail associated with the object.
9. COMMENTS
Sighting was of 5 min. Report came from 13 miles east of Fairview, North Dakota. Several persons in the car observed the object, but none could determine its exact size. Since it was a very bright object and moved rapidly, it would be difficult to establish exact size and distance.
