The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass rose with instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction of a phenomenon when first observed. The second sketch contains two landscape drawings, one larger and one smaller, showing a person standing in a hilly or mountainous landscape.

Text extracted from the document:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "U" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A DOT AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. A LINE DRAWN BETWEEN THE TWO DOTS WILL SHOW THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF TRAVEL OF THE PHENOMENON. IF THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
