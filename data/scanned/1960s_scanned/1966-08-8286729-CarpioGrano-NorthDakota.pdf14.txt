The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of a UFO-like object. The sketch appears to be a simple outline of an unidentified flying object with a curved, elongated shape. There is a note below the sketch that provides an explanation about the object, stating that when the sighting occurred, the object was not seen clearly due to clouds obscuring the view.

Transcribing the text in the document:

Note: when the object passed, it was not seen clearly at first because of a thin haze or cloud, the edge of the object was indistinct, and it looked longer and more oval than it actually was. When the object passed through the haze, the exact shape and size of the object was observed.
