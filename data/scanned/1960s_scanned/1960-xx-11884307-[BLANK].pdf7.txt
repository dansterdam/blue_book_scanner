The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing an Air Defense Command order that forbids the GOC (Ground Observer Corps) from linking with a documentary UFO film.

Transcription of the text in the document:

AIR DEFENSE COMMAND FORBIDS GOC LINK WITH FILM

The following message from ADC is quoted for your information and guidance:

"JADHS 22273: Disapprove request for GOC Display and Commercial film pertaining to the controversial subject of flying saucers. Use of Display would incite the risk that Air Force could be considered as endorsing incidents and contradictory theories." 

BY ORDER OF THE COMMANDER,

DONALD A. ZEINE, Major USAF
Assistant

The official request to tie in the GOC program with the documentary "United Artists film" was made by Capt. William A. Reeve, 4677th Observation Squadron.

The ADC refused to answer, once again, requests from members have frequently asked, was the documentary film "Unidentified Flying Objects" produced with Air Force cooperation. From the letter it appears that less than half of NICAP's members saw this movie, which included the scene of Warrant Officer D.C. Newhouse, and the reports of two DF-UFOs taken by Ris Marlene at Great Falls ballpark.

Even those who did see the picture may be unaware of the stars which led to public use of the image for narrative purposes in the film. As centered on Allan M. Chop, former Air Force Captain, who handled UFO information in the Pentagon, (now a NICAP Special Advisor,) he was deposed for secret reports of the officially analyzed Mariana film taken on August 15, 1950, which shows two attraction UFOs over Great Falls ballpark.
