Dear Sir:

I wish to report the sighting of an object which might be an interplanetary craft. The object was observed at a point 2 miles west of Crete, Illinois, near a gleaming chrome-like football-shaped object hovering over the ground. It was at the time of the sighting, between 1:15 and 1:45 AM CST. The object was observed through an 8x scope. Visibility was very good, but there may have been some light haze. The duration of the sighting was less than a minute. I would judge that it would probably be impossible to catch the object, as I am reporting because I suspect that any sightings of this nature are generally treated very skeptically, and anyone who reports seeing a "flying saucer" is usually ridiculed as being eccentric. In my case, I have no reason to doubt my own observation which was of a very interesting nature. I am not given to fancies, and, unless I am greatly mistaken, I have observed something quite out of the ordinary. If there is any possibility that this object was some type of conventional aircraft, I would be glad to have that information. However, I saw no lights, either flashing or steady, and the object gave no indication of being an aircraft. It was simply hanging motionless in the air. I hope this report will be received and treated seriously. If there are others who have observed similar objects, I would be interested in hearing from them.

Respectfully,
John P. Calvin
Captain, U.S.A.F.
