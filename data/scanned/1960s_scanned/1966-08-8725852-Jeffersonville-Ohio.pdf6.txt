The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document. The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or report form filled out, likely as part of the Project Blue Book investigation.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): YES / No / Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes / No / Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: 3 red light in a triangle
b. Color: 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Just about 1/2 of the whole object.

19. Can you draw a picture that will show the shape of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. These are erratic - inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
