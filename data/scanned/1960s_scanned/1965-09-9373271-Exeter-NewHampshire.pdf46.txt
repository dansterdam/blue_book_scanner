The text in the document is as follows:

"3 Sep 65, Exeter, N Hampshire

Capt David Moody called Griffis AFB, N York and talked with Sgt Bunt, 416 SW of the 402nd Operations Squadron. Informed that Farmer Boy refusing route had been changed to our Trapper. Records showed that no refueling operations were conducted on the nights of 3-3 Sep and 6 Sep. The route was closed from 03/0500 to 03/0500 for an 8th Air Force Operation "Big Blast".

Sgt Bunt informed Capt Moody that a refueling area west near "Dryden" controlled at Loring AFB, paralleled "Eur-Trapper" adjacent to the old Farmer Boy area. Sgt Moody called Col Smith at Loring AFB. No flights were conducted on the morning of 3 Sep and when Loring entered the speedway refueling area near Indianapolis at 07/0110Z, there were no refueling operations in this new England area during the time in question.

Any information on "Big Blast" should be obtained from Capt Moody. He did the 15th scene wing USAF at Hanscom. Records show DOCO authorized this operation on 31 Aug 65 and records confirm this information.

The above was accomplished by telephone on 22 September 1965."
