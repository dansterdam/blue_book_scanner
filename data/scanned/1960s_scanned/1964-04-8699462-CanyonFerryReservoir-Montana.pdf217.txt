Walthamstow "object from space"

The Walthamstow Guardian reported an incident on April 13, 1964 in the 17 issue "An unidentified flying object hurtled through the air, severed telephone wires, etched a deep scar in the concrete side of a Bower Lane house, and ploughed into a back garden pond". 

The report was received by police just before 8 o'clock on Monday night (April 13). It came from a Walthamstow resident, Mrs. R. O. Ball, of 47 Upper Walthamstow Road, who stated that she had been awakened by a very loud noise and had seen something go straight across the road and into a back garden in Berry Lane. They found the phone wires down, and a search of the bank revealed nothing. The river was dredgedâ€”in vain.

Cyril this was reported as he drove home in the early hours of Tuesday morning. He said, "I just glanced into her back and saw something leaving from the back of the house straight across the road and, had I been a few yards further forward, I would have been hit by it." The object, he said, was very fast. "It was traveling very straight across the road and, had I been a few yards further forward, I would have been hit by it."

At first I thought the back window of the house had come in and as I approached I could see plastic splinters on the ground. There was a big splash in the water. 

A police spokesman said that four ducks had been disturbed while the river was being dredged and that was all that could be found.
