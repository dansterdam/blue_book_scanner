PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 67-26
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION HOLLAND, MISSOURI
DATE 10 March 1967
PHOTOGRAPHY
AF 
IR One roll 8 mm motion picture film (color)
QUALITY Poor
1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 67-11, submitted by Major H. Jordan, requesting an analysis of an 8 mm motion picture film taken of a flying object.
2. ANALYSIS: The entire roll of film was scanned and was found to be blank with the exception of two small, roughly circular bright spot images. A detailed photographic analysis of these images reveals no photographic evidence to support the identification of the subject.
3. An examination of the film by a photo processing specialist reveals similar circular bright spot images occurring outside of the normal frame area. On the entire roll of film there is no evidence of the scene lines which would be expected on a normally exposed 8 mm motion picture film. This raises the possibility that the film was not exposed or was run through a camera where there is light leak.
4. Further analysis could possibly be accomplished if more data was furnished in regard to the comments in Paragraphs 2 and 3.
