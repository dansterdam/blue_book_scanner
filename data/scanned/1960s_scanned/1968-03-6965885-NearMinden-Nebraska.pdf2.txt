Gentlemen:

At approximately 10:40 P. M., Central Standard Time, my wife and I was driving one of our cars one-fourth mile ahead of me, and I was driving at approximately the same rate, over the Interste-80 Bridge ten miles north of Minden, and we both saw a green object very clearly. My daughter and I saw it through her rear view through my front window.

We continued driving south toward Minden, Nebraska, and at 10:49 P.M., one and one-half miles north of Minden, we saw another object, which appeared to be perhaps a plane with its landing lights on. As it got closer, it was not a plane. It was some separate objects, very bright, not hot light. They were eliptical in shape and as they came toward us, they suddenly went out. The very instant a red exhaust resembling a jet engine, came from the rear. It hung suspended in the air for perhaps two and half times longer than it took to disappear. Soon they emitted some kind of a loud noise, like a sharp pocket burst, they separated and disappeared.

At no time did we feel any heat or experience any difficulty with our car, or any of the other symptoms which we have read in other reports we do seal that something unusual took place at this particular time.

We think it might be connected with the green ball seen ten miles earlier over the Platte River near the Minden Inter-Change on State 30 and Highway, Nebraska, 10.

This is merely to report the sighting of these objects.

Cordially yours,
PAW/ak
