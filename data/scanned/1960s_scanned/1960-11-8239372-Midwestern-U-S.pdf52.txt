SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. On 8 Nov. 1960, at approximately 1815 hours, the reporting officer received a telephone call from an unidentified man who stated that he had observed an unusual aerial object northwest of Bellefontaine, Ohio, at approximately 1730 hours the same date.

2. The caller stated that he was driving north on State Route 117 when he observed a bright, shiny, metallic object hovering in the sky at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet and approximately 5 miles distant. The object was described as round in shape, 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and surrounded by a red glow. The object remained hovering in the same general area for approximately 15 minutes, then suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

3. The caller was unable to furnish any additional information concerning the object or its origin. He was reluctant to identify himself and would not permit the reporting officer to call him back for further information. 

4. The reporting officer contacted the Columbus Sector, Air Defense Command, to determine if any aircraft were operating in the area at the time of the reported sighting. The Columbus Sector advised that no aircraft were airborne in the area.

5. This incident is considered unresolved due to the lack of additional information concerning the object and its origin. The reporting officer was unable to obtain any additional information or evidence concerning this sighting.
