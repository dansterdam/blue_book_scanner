Gentlemen:

Enclosed find the form issued to any one who claims to have sighted a U.F.O.

Perhaps if some were not so damned bitter against the sight and their explanations, we would get their report and fill out the form. I have my own opinion of . However those people and their explanations they try to give their usual public, I have my own opinion of.

I have read a book, put out by a high ranking Colonel by saying the COAST GUARD, signaled a Ship on a foggy night to feel sure the Shore Patrol.

Having lived in New York Harbor, sea, I heard the ships fog horns every time it foggy, if the COAST GUARD did not hear of FOG HORNS, I think it is about time they learned.

However that is his explanation and I hope this form tells some folks that SOME PEOPLE like a TV HAND such as the COLONEL who wrote that book fell over a year ago. I have made a standing offer.

This is it.

Do you want to see a U.F.O. any night in the week ?
Have you any equipment that can test it over a distance ?
I can point it out, if you have the time to wait.
Can you take any pictures of it ?
Can you "triangle" it in some matches ?
See it with the naked eyes, telescopes., or any way you prefer. Set your equipment up in my back yard, leave it, and come back to-morrow night and find your tests.
If one night is not enough- take a week.
That is the offer I made and still stands.
