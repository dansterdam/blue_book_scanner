The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document that provides instructions and diagrams related to a UFO report or sighting. The document includes a sketch that shows the position and orientation of an unidentified object in relation to the horizon, as well as a compass rose. There are also instructions for the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects.

Text extracted from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you first saw it.

90°  75°
60°
45°
30°
15°
0°

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
