The form did not arrive several weeks later, and in the meantime so many other incidents occurred that I overlooked it.

Eventually my persistance in believing that not Jupiter paid-off for one night it moved considered to me and it seemed to my a small dim-glowing object hovered behind me at tree-top level. For several nights thereafter I attempted to find a place to achieve an even closer sighting of this UFO, but always with negative results. While I followed in my car. As if responding to my presence it led me in a very hilly area, some thirty miles east of my home. It descended to earth. The spot was an open semi-cleared land, and in my headlights' glare I could see empty the remnants of crude make-shift shelters. I was reluctant to get in close to this place so I drove on until I found an area where I could park and study the sky. When I had raised my glasses point of it, I discovered that not one, but stars were descending toward me at an angle slightly below the horizon.
