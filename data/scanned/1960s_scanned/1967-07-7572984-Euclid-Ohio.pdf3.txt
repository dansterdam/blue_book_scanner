UFO Observation, July 30, 1967

Mrs. [redacted], Euclid, Ohio 44123

Dear Mrs. [redacted]:

This replies to your kind letter of August 9, 1967 concerning your unusual observation. Investigations revealed that you probably observed the planet Venus. At the time of your sighting, Venus would have been in the eastern sky. The elevation of Venus at that time was consistent with past descriptions of this planet. Venus, with an estimated magnitude of -4.1, was by far brighter than any star visible from the earth, including the sun. 

When stars or planets are viewed low on the horizon, the observer is looking through a denser layer of the earth's atmosphere. This acts as a prism, which in effect causes the incoming rays of light to be bent. This accounts for the apparent change in shape, brightness, and movement. The brightness enables it to be seen before other astronomical bodies. This was the reason it was seen at dusk.

When viewed through binoculars, stars and planets appear too large in size with various distinct lights. This is an usual occurrence caused by apparent and chromatic aberration of the lenses.
