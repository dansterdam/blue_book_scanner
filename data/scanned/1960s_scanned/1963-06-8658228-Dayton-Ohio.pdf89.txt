There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire filled out by a witness.

39. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object? 
(Circle One) Yes No

IF you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate?

40. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was?
(Circle One) Yes No

IF you answered YES, then how far away would you say it was?

41. Please give the following information about yourself:

TELEPHONE NUMBER: 
AGE: SEX: 

Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any education, which might be pertinent.

42. Date you completed this questionnaire: 8 June 1963

This report was ground to Capt Brennan, 80th office, just as I left the Ohio State Patrol office on Mon., June 3, 1963. The report was turned over to the Project Blue Book by the Air Force.
