There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, which contains detailed textual information about a UFO sighting.

FACTS: Two UFO Reports/Observations, Mass. 7/25/65 - S. Hadleytown)
Outdoor conditions were generally clear and warm. There was a slight wind from the south-southwest. The object was first seen at approximately 8:30 PM and was visible for around 10 minutes.

EVALUATION:
- had never seen a UFO before - claims the object was metallic and bright. It was observed near a tree-line and seemed near the ground at first, then rapidly climbed and moved off to the west. The object did not emit any light or sound.
- is a reliable witness. She did not read literature on UFOs. She is not the type who looks for UFOs, but this sighting startled her greatly. This was her first and only UFO experience.

MOON: - The moon (first quarter) was lightly in the western sky, and provided limited illumination in the general area of the sighting.

STARS: - were and bright, and the brighter stars in the western sky were visible. This aided in the visual evaluation of the object.

BALLOON: NEGATIVE: The object moved much faster than a balloon, and its rapid ascent and departure was not characteristic of a balloon.

Speed: Rapid, the object first appeared close to the ground, then rapidly climbed and moved off to the west at a high rate of speed.

Direction: The object first appeared near a tree-line and moved off to the west at a high rate of speed.

Size: Small - about the apparent size of a star when first sighted, but seemed to get larger as it climbed.

Infrared: The object moved soundlessly and gave off no glow or exhaust, which indicates it was not an aircraft or conventional craft.

Possible but HIGHLY improbable: The object with an apparent metallic luster and rapid motion could have been some form of highly unconventional aircraft or device, but this is considered most unlikely given the lack of distinguishing features and the rapidity of the sighting.

I telephoned the Air Force Coordinator for UFO sightings in Boston and reported the details of this sighting. The Air Force officer stated that my report would be made part of the official Air Force files on UFOs.
