The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, which contains a letter discussing the examination of a submitted negative and related observations.

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted]

Dear [redacted]:

Reference your recent correspondence regarding your observation and subsequent photograph of an unidentified flying object.

Examination of the submitted negative has negated double exposure and/or retouch. Close inspection of the negative reveals many smaller images in addition to the bright image which is visible on the prints. These smaller images appear to follow a course parallel to the path of the bright image, indicating that the camera was moved rather than the images moving as the photograph was taken. Rotation should be made of the fact that the images are located in the trailer section of the film and not in a normal frame position. Without specific details, there is no way to determine what produced the images.

The description of the visual observation is consistent with that of an aircraft sighting. Jet aircraft operating at altitudes above 20,000 to 25,000 feet can be usually observed; however, unless proper conditions prevail, they cannot be heard. Lack of sound is not a valid reason to exclude an aircraft. After detailed investigation, it appears an aircraft could have been responsible for the sighting, although it was not photographed.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
