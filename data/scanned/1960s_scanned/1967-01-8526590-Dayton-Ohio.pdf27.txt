The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a typed Project Blue Book report.

In February 1965, a file was submitted to Wright-Patterson AFB that was examined by the Aerial Phenomena Group. The document describes an incident that occurred in early 1967 where a very small indistinct image was observed on a film. No one visually sighted the object described in the incident. The document notes the extreme lack of data, and the lack of clarity of the image, making any investigation or evaluation difficult.
