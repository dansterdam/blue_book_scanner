Transcription of the text:

I write say that it was an eerie and somewhat frightening sight. At first it frightened my wife into tears.

I would appreciate if you could offer some credible and reasonable explanation as to what this object "might have appeared" but I am not a "prying sort", nor but I can't help wondering what it is saw.

When I have an opportunity with continue to look for this object. (full four observations were feeling the air is being disturbed which the object passed over the location.) I will continue to scan so I might see it again â€” this time to try to photograph the object with a camera which I have loaded and ready.

Thank you.
