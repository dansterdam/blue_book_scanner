MR 12 February 1965

FRL Finkelmann returned call at 1005, 12 Feb 65, per request of Sgt Jones, relating to object he received from his residence on 6 Feb 65. FRL Finkelmann said nothing about building a tree house and they saw the object and decided to get it and take it to their house. Besides taking the object, the son's neighbor boy took some boards that were both outside.

The boys said it has been there (in the water) since at least last summer, which Sgt Jones asked the FRL if he asked the boys why they didn't get it then and he said he asked why they didn't, because the water was so deep for them.

FRL Finkelmann said where the boys found it was about 1/4 mile away from the house. FRL Finkelmann made a call to the Command Post and asked them to pick up an unknown object from his farm.
