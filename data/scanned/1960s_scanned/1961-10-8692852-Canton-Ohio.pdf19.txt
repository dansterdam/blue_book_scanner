"APRCC SCJIE 1951 July 1961

An unidentified flying object was observed by Mr. and Mrs. Richard DuSte of Canton, Ohio, on July 14, 1961.

At approximately 10:00 P.M. EDT, while watching television in their living room, Mrs. DuSte observed a bright light in the southwest sky. She called her husband's attention to it, and he also observed the object.

The object appeared to be stationary at first, but then began to move rapidly in a zigzag or erratic pattern. it changed directions several times, sometimes moving horizontally, sometimes vertically, and sometimes at an angle.

The object seemed to be a bright white light, about the size of a grapefruit when held at arm's length. It was much brighter than any star or planet in the sky. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes.

According to Mr. and Mrs. DuSte, the object appeared to be several thousand feet above the ground. It did not seem to increase or decrease in size, nor did it appear to emit any smoke or vapor trail.

When the object finally moved out of sight to the southwest, Mr. DuSte and his wife observed what appeared to be a "trail of the moonlight" following the object. This "trail" remained visible for several minutes after the object had disappeared.

The DuStes stated that they were completely baffled by the object they observed, and they are convinced that it was not an airplane, satellite, or any other known type of aircraft. They described the object as unlike anything they had ever seen before."
