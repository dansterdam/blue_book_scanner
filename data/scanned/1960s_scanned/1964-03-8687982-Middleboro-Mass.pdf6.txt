The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter dated June 12, 1964, from Maston M. Jacks of the Public Information Division, Office of Information, regarding unidentified flying objects.

The text of the document is as follows:

June 12, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in reply to your letter of May 29, 1964. In which you requested certain publications on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects. 

AFRP 200-2 is for inter-service guidance and AFNG 3520.1 is a Navy document which is used solely for Navy guidance.

There are no photographs or drawings available for distribution. Those photographs which were submitted for analysis have been evaluated as common objects, balloons, and all have been returned to the senders.

We are enclosing the latest Air Force Fact Sheet on Unidentified Flying Objects together with a copy of the recent Socorro, New Mexico sighting.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
