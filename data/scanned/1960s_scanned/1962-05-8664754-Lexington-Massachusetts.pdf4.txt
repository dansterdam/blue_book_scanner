The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. The page contains a form with questions about the observed UFO, but there is no photograph included on this particular page.

The text from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one): Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one): Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound none
b. Color appeared to be very bright

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length and see how much of the object's apparent size it covers. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object's width would the match have covered?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object such as wings, projections, etc., and especially show if the object was rotating.
[Hand-drawn sketch showing an elliptical/oval shape with the note: "No explanation apparent, no wings on moving object, no rotation."]
