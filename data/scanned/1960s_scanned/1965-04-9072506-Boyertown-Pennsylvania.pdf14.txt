Reference the attached letter from reporting
an unidentified flying object on the night of 30 Apr 65. The
following is a suggested reply:
The objects observed by you and your son on the night
of 30 Apr 65 would appear to be many reports of lights in
the sky which are frequently reported. These objects are
gathered with the duration of 3-6 seconds and the distance traveled
is in accordance with that of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena which
only during very bright moonlight or when they are close enough
to the observer to achieve apparent size can a ground source be
determined. Sightings of this nature, while they are of
brief period of time, do accumulate and are considered of
interest as an average of these and four times a year.
