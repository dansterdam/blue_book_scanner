Dear Sirs:
I am reading a book about project blue book and find it most interesting. I am even an our teacher. One girl and five others saw an unusual event take place on the hill last summer. There is a lake called Pish lake where mile they were looking over at a trailer camp. As the girls saw the tube go over the lake and suck water out, what this was I don't know. I do not know would not.
In bed when 11 or a sudden it the ground there was a strange sound and three objects appeared. They stopped and one could see through them. One could move a bit. I could not because the moon was in the south and the object was in the north. Then I found that my dog was hysterical and could not move a bit. All of a sudden back it went appeared and could move. Then it went away. Ever since then my dog has had attacks. The next morning I told my mom she said I was dreaming. But I yen not I swear I was not what it was I do not know and I will never forget it!!!
Sincerely,
