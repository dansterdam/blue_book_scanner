This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet, specifically a "SUMMARY DATA" form. The form has fields for the witness' name, signature, and date. The bulk of the text on the form appears to be handwritten observations or details related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

(HANDWRITTEN TEXT)
I went over to my friends house near danvers mass. at around 10:30 pm. we where standing out side and suddenly we noticed a strange lighted object come in from the northwest very low over the trees. it was about the size of a silver dollar at arms length and had a bright bluish-white light in the center surrounded by a halo or ring of red orange light.the object moved very rapidly straight down out of our sight somewhere behind some trees, then it came back up into view again and repeated the same manuver several times always disappearing behind some trees and then reappearing again. then the object took off at a terrific speed to the southeast and was out of sight in a couple of seconds. the total time of the sighting was about 2 or 3 minutes. the object made no sound. we where both very excited and impressed by what we saw.
