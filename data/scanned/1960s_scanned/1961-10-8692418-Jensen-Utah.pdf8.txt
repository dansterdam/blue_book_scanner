UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT 

DATE: 8 October 1961

CASE # 8692418

LOCATION: Jensen, Utah

WITNESS: JOHN SMITH (Fictitious name)

SUMMARY:
On the evening of 8 October 1961, at approximately 8:30 PM, Mr. John Smith (fictitious name) was driving on a rural highway near Jensen, Utah when he observed a bright light in the sky. The object appeared to be hovering, and then suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view. Mr. Smith reported the incident to the local authorities, who in turn notified the United States Air Force.

INVESTIGATION:
Air Force investigators were dispatched to the location and interviewed Mr. Smith. During the interview, Mr. Smith provided a detailed description of the object he had observed. According to his account, the object was circular in shape, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and had a bright, luminous glow. The object appeared to be hovering silently at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet before suddenly accelerating and disappearing.

The investigators conducted a thorough search of the area but found no physical evidence to corroborate Mr. Smith's account. No other witnesses were identified in the immediate vicinity. The case was classified as "unresolved" and added to the Project Blue Book files for further analysis.
