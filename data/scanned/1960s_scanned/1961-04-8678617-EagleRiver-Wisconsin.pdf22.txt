The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing an encounter with a UFO. The text of the document is as follows:

IT took it to the basement where he had a pump and filled it with water, carried it out to the craft, and banked it up to the craft. In doing so, he had to get up on tiptoe and put one hand against the craft, he says, and effected the transfer of the jug. He described the interior as extremely black, and said he saw three control panels, and noted that there were two other men inside. The men he described as extremely clean-shaven, he said very smooth-faced, but dark and short, about 5 feet, he estimated. He said they looked like Italian. Their dress was also black, like a "limited jersey" was as close as he could come to it, and he insisted that they had turtle-neck counter-type apparel. From his account, it seemed to be that it was aware of the approach through some sense of ours that could not now be determined. There was no communication except by sign language between them, and as he backed away from the craft, he said he saw the interior lights, and that it was extremely beautiful. He said he could see to have a room painted in the same way. He noticed that one of the men was apparently cooking something, and in his attempt to communicate by sign language, indicating that they had water, he came back and motioned with his mouth that they could not drink, but apparently this sign language was misinterpreted as indicating that he wanted some of the stuff they were cooking, and thereupon they handed him three or four of these little monelike cakes, and as soon as the transfer was effected, the hatch swung down, closed with a click, and he says that the "doing" was incomprehensible, he could not tell whether the batch had been open or not, that it rose vertically without any apparent acceleration, except, of course, at a tremendous rate of speed.
