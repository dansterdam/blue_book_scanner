I always understood that - t the cot4 of the.s.perts conthined in the , 3e3 project blue book report no. 3aI am , 'on at a loss as to :h-. I can do, Or who I can turn to, for help in clari.ficatien uf the contents of the report.

The report refers to a "sFheric:1 object" observed at iZaywood, Illinois on August 8, 19c2. The object was observed for about 10 minutes by tro reliable witnesses. The description of the object is very cimilar to that of an unidentified flying object reported in other cases in the bluct book files.

Please advise me as to any ection I can take to obtain clarificat:on from the Air Force regarding this particular case. I am quite concerned about the implications of what appear to be reliable reports of unconventional acriel phenomena that remain unexplained after investigation by the Air Force. If you can suggest any appropriate government agency or private organization that I night contact for assistance, I would greatly appreciate your advice.

Thank you very much for your consideration of this matter. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely yours,
