There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

THE OBJECT WAS A SPACECRAFT, METEORITE, OR SOME OTHER OBJECT IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW.
The object was bright, self-luminous, and orange-red in color. It looked somewhat like a large star in origin, but its behavior was not like that of a star. It hovered for a short time, then began moving slowly at first, then more rapidly toward the north star. First it looked bright, then faded to a dull reddish glow as it moved farther away.
