SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information
TO: Hq USAF SAFOPI (Mrs. Hunt)
WASH DC 20330
Reference the attached letter from requesting information on his unidentified observation of 24 Aug 65. The additional information necessary for us to evaluate his sighting of 24 Aug 65. The distance object, location, and details of approach, hovering, and departure appear to have similarities to a parachute or hornet's nest lead to an evaluation of the observation as a natural occurrence. While reports of this nature appear to the Air Force does receive during the period in question, the fact that the bird must be far enough away from the observer for identification as such, and yet near enough to enable observation of the said details, suggests the circumstances sufficiently unusual that bid/identification can occur
