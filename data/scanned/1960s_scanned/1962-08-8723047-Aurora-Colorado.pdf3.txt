(1) "At 1015, 28 Aug 62, just after sunset in Del Mar Park, an object was sighted in the western horizon and seemed to move and hover at 10-20 early 235. It appeared 'very strange and much larger than a commercial jet-liner' -- much brighter than a star." The object was observed from his USMC station with binoculars for approximately 10-15 minutes. It did not appear to move appreciably during the observation. Much brighter than the reflection of the sun and appeared to be a class 2 object. This information was obtained in a call-back to the earlier caller.

(2) "Could not ascertain size, speed, or maneuver nor colors or details, but was from 10-20 miles distance as viewed. Cannot state shape -- appeared to be a 'finger with above the horizon.' (As viewed with binoculars)." The object maintained this position for the duration of the observation and then disappeared from sight.

(3) "At this time the object was lost from sight." This is leaving occurred during the departure of the object and not towards the close of the maneuvers.

(4) "Could not ascertain his had not been inclination. The binoculars had not been employed prior to this sighting, nor had he read the recent book on flying saucers."
