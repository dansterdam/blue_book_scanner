The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page reads:

Report of phone call made on January 14 to Mrs. _____. The witness was one of several persons of good reliability that the object sighted was an advertising plane flying over a local football field where a game was in progress. Also the description of the object given by the witness did not support this. The fact that this was by only one group of witnesses in a metropolitan area in the early evening of the summer night makes the entire case suspect. It is likely, therefore, that an advertising plane was misidentified as a flying saucer.
