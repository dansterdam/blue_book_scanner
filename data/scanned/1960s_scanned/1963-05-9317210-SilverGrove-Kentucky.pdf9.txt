There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet, specifically case no. 1, where the observer's report is being considered. The text states: "Case No. 1 - Although the object may have been an aircraft, we feel that because of the unreliability of the observer the report should be rejected from serious consideration."
