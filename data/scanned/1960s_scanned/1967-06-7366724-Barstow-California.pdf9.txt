This sighted was as observed of the northeast horizon by me on July 6, 1957. I first noticed the object about 7:50 PM and observed it for approximately 15 minutes. It appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. The object was a bright white or silver color and gave off a light in all directions. It did not appear to be an aircraft or meteor as known to me. The object made no sound and left no trail as it moved through the sky. For this reason I feel it was not a conventional aircraft.
