COMMENTS: Mrs. Hank McGonn during phone interview seemed to be reliable until further probing found that her observation of something sighted in the air force and seemed to feel he was an authority on contraits, aircraft shapes, etc. Further probing found that she observed someone signaling by light in some code (SOS) to the object. It is to be noted that this observation was made on July 5th, a legal holiday with many fireworks displays throughout the city. Also the witness White box were playing a night game. At most of the night games fireworks are set off, this reporter could not establish the fighting is detectable because of the sound of the reports. The witness has failed to do so to this date.
