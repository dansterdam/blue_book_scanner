14 September 1967 22:52/2274. FFD-TIK
Crew: [REDACTED]

After departure from FFO, we proceeded direct to Dayton VOR, climbing to 10,000 feet. Upon passing the station at 05302 at 5,000 feet, climbing I called attention to the appearance of stationary lights slightly higher than 5,000 feet. The traffic was northbound, moving at a high rate of speed. We estimate distance to be about 3,000 feet from the tail area. The lights were then observed to be three in number, white in color, and the lights on the object proper were then observed to be three in number, white of high intensity. The object disappeared at 1730 o'clock position. This phenomenon was not unlike that which has been previously reported. I estimate that we observed the sighting. This was not a conventional aircraft or meteor.

II. 11/4/35
At 0912z, our altitude 10,000 feet, heading 244 degrees, an object trailing brilliant green and orange lights was sighted in about a 30 degree downward trajectory and the flames disappeared. This was sighted at our 2 o'clock position. 20 degrees down. The rest of the crew was further confirmation of the sighting, but by denial.

III.
At about 0912z, a bright white light (level-high) from 1 o'clock position to about 4:30 to 5 o'clock position. The object traveled the same side of a triangular path on a continuous even keel. Two or three star-like objects were observed for about 30 minutes, and could have been a satellite.
