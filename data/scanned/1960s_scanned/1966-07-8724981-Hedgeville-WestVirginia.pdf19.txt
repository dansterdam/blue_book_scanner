UFO HOVERS IN SKY HERE LAST NIGHT
Large Object Close To Earth - Hovered Motionless For Several Hours
Greendale, W. Va., July 7 - Several young men, including Robert Holland, Ed Perine, and Hogan, reported last night at about 12:30 a.m. they had seen a large object hovering motionless over the Greendale Road via the "Water Works." 
The object is said to have hovered for several hours at a fixed position. It was described as large, circular in shape, and giving off a bright light. It was observed through binoculars. The object made no sound and suddenly flashed away with fantastic speed.
Sgt. Peterson an old-timer on the Greendale Police Force, and Paulene, a resident, also observed the object and were reported to be "amazed" at its appearance. 
There were sounds of a jet plane approaching the area which may have caused the object to suddenly flash away.
The Greendale Police said they would continue to investigate the report and would question all possible witnesses. Sgt. Puccia said it matched previous UFO reports. However, no official confirmation was made.
