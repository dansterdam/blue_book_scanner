A UFO was seen near Washington, D.C. on the night of February 6th, 1963. Two small lights that could not be identified were observed. The UFO appeared off their right wing at a distance of several miles, and then two additional lights were observed, one above and one below the original lights, in close formation. The lights were white, and appeared to be about ten feet in diameter. The light from the UFO was so bright that it cast reflections on the plane.
