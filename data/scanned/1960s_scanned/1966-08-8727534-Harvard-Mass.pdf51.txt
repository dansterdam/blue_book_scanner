The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page appears to be a questionnaire or survey form with several questions about the sighting of an unidentified object.

The text found in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It just disappeared.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of:
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: Glowing, flashing, changing in shape, sil-houette, gray color, metallic, or anything else.
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment by the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object you can such as wings, projections, etc., and especially relative trails or vapor trails.

The text in the image appears to be a handwritten response to the questionnaire.
