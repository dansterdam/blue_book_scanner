1. At approximately 1335 on 12 August 1965, while the pilot flying a T-33B aircraft, approximately 12 miles east of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, had a local transmission flight out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and unidentified maneuver in flight.

2. Capt Cannon was the instructor pilot on board. He was seated in the rear (right seat) and Capt Wilkinson, undergoing a proficiency flight check, was in the pilot's (left seat). It was determined in the investigation that Capt Wilkinson, at the time in question, was not aware of the sighting and did not become aware of it until after the incident had occurred.

3. Capt Cannon stated that through the windscreen, an object, oval in shape, was observed traveling at a high rate of speed. The object seemed to be faster than the aircraft and it appeared to be about 3-4 miles away. The base was very dense, and a thin black smoke or vapor trail appeared to be emitting from the object as it passed by the aircraft. The object seemed to be approximately 3000 feet. We had just completed our turn after passing over Springfield, and the object was noticed at that time. The object then appeared to pick up speed and it appeared to be about 0.5 to 1.0 miles away. The base was very dense, and the object seemed to be moving very fast. It then appeared to slow considerably as it passed under the aircraft. The total elapsed time from first sighting to the time the object passed under the aircraft was no more than 6-8 seconds. The speed in its initial pass seemed to be faster than the speed in its 3 descents. As the object descended, it seemed to be faster as it was the case of the speed of its 3 descents.
