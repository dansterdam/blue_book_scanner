3 January 1965

Mrs. c. c. XXXXX 
U. S. Air Force Academy
Colorado

Dear Mrs. XXXXX:

This is in answer to your letter of December 9. Thank you for your cooperative efforts.

Some action has been taken with the sighting which Mrs. XXXXX states was investigated through official channels. It appears that this could be considered an official or unofficial "unknown" but I am unable to give you any further details as to the real nature of the sighting through official channels.

I appreciate your opinion on this, and, of course, if you have any further information that would be helpful, I would be glad to receive it.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
