Dear Sir:
On Aug. 26, 1960 at about 8:35 P.M. I was looking out of my front window and saw a bright object in the sky which was flashing various colors and seemed to be hovering in the air, then it would dart in different directions, stop, and hover again. It disappeared over my house and I saw it again about 5 minutes later hovering above the trees at the rear of my lot. I watched it for about 10 minutes, then it suddenly disappeared. I was so excited that I forgot to get my camera, but I have told my neighbors about it and they saw it also. If you would like more information, please let me know.
Sincerely yours,
