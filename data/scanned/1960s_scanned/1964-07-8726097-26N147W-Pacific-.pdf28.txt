Captain E. W. Henry, USAF
Public Information Officer
Eglin AFB, Florida

Dear Captain Henry:

I read in the newspaper comments from someone who was the individual who took the motion picture film of the unidentified flying object over the Pacific Ocean near Eglin AFB.

I would particularly need a few of the details mentioned in the article. From what I understand, several men in the beginning, seven or eight, saw the object hovering, and then it took off at a tremendous speed. The object seemed to be about the size of an auto, and was metallic in appearance.

I would be very interested in learning more details of this incident, such as the exact date, time, location, direction of flight, and any other pertinent information that you might be able to provide. I am particularly interested, since I am currently working on a book concerning UFO sightings, and would like to include this incident if possible.

It will be on two-week active duty with the 2131st USAF Reserve Training Squadron, 12 July - 26 July, and perhaps through the 29th, if anything develops.

Sincerely,
