Proposed reply to letter from May 26, 1967

Dear [Redacted],

This replies to your recent letter of May 26, 1967 in which you report your unidentified observation. At this late date, a meaningful scientific investigation is not possible on your sighting of August 1966.

It is important for an individual to report his observation to the nearest Air Force installation as soon as possible. This enables the base UFO investigator to perform a detailed on-the-spot investigation.

Normally, air activity records are destroyed after thirty days, says this. At this late date we would be unable to check for any air activity at the time of your sighting. We will add your information to the present data base.
