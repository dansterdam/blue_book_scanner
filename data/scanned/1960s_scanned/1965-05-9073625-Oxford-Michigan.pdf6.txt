UNIDENTIFIED FOREIGN OBJECT REPORT
14 MAY 1965
Mr. -------
Oxford, Michigan 48071
Dear Mr. -------:
This is a final report on your unidentified foreign object sighting on 23 April 1965. The object or phenomenon described by you was visible for approximately 45 minutes and was observed moving in a north-south direction at an estimated altitude of 1500-2000 feet. The object was described as being whitish in color, approximately 20-30 feet in diameter, and possibly having a luminous quality. The object or phenomenon moved slowly at first and then accelerated rapidly out of sight to the north.
All available information has been carefully analyzed, and we can find no evidence to indicate the object was of extraterrestrial or 'foreign' origin. Detailed investigation has revealed no factual data to support the supposition that the object was a vehicle of unknown or unconventional design.
We appreciate your reporting this sighting, and thank you for your interest and cooperation.
FOR THE COMMANDER
ROBERT S. CURRY
Colonel, USAF
Chief, Air Force Investigations Division
