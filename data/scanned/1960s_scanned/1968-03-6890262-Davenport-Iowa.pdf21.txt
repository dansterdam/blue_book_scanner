Dear sir:
I am writing you once more regarding my sighting of a UFO on April 5, 1968. As I stated in my previous letter, I was outside my home in Davenport, Iowa at approximately 9:30 PM when I observed a large, oval-shaped object hovering in the sky. The object was approximately 75 feet in diameter and was illuminated with a bright white light. The object hovered silently for several minutes before slowly ascending and eventually disappearing from view.

I am still very interested in learning more about this incident and would appreciate any additional information or insights you can provide. Please let me know if you need any further details from me.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted]
