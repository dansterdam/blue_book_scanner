The image contains a schematic diagram and a handwritten response to a question. The diagram appears to be illustrating the trajectory of an object or objects, showing angles and directions of movement. The handwritten response indicates that there was more than one object observed, and they formed a formation that traveled in a northeasterly direction.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the survey line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "C" on the compass to indicate that first direction you saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

One object split into one that traveled in a Northeasterly direction toward the swaying treetops.
