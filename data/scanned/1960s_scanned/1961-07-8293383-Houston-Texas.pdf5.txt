Late News Flashes
The CIA completed its intensive investigation yesterday into the UFO sightings reported in the Houston, Texas area on 10 July 1961. It was concluded that the sightings were likely due to the presence of high-altitude search balloons in the area, rather than any extraterrestrial craft. The witnesses, while sincere in their reports, were likely mistaken in their identification of the objects. No further action is required.
