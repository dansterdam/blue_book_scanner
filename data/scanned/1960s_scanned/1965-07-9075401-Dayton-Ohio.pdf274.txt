The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page of handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

This observation was made on 9 July 1965 in the Dayton, Ohio area. The witness reported seeing a bright light moving erratically in the sky, changing directions and speeds abruptly. The light was observed for approximately 45 minutes before disappearing. No other details are provided in the report.
