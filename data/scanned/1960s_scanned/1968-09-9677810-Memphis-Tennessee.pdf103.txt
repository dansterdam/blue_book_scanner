This image contains several illustrations related to a UFO report document. The first illustration is a compass-like diagram with directional labels, likely used to indicate the direction of the observed phenomenon. The second and third illustrations depict sketches of observed UFO sightings, showing a person standing in the foreground and a landscape in the background.

The text in the document appears to be instructions or guidelines for describing and documenting UFO sightings, including directions on how to use the compass-like diagram and the sketches.

The text in the document reads:

ON NOW NOTHING YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "B". THAT IS, APPROXIMATELY SHOW WHERE THE PHENOMENON WAS SITUATED AS IT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY. ATTEMPT TO BE ACCURATE, GUIDED AS AN EXAMPLE BY THE SKETCH AS AN EXPLANATION OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
