The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document describing an observed object.

The orientation of the lights as it came nearer changed from a line to two rows, to an ellipse (minor diameter almost equal major diameter) as it passed over head (at about 75Â°), then to a flat eclipse, two lines, and a single light source as it continued westerly. Apparently no sound was heard in connection with the object as it passed overhead.

The lights of the object as it passed overhead appeared as in Figure 1. The central light appeared as a circular "glow". This glow varied in intensity from dim gradually to bright (felt to be a little brighter than the glow of a watch dial) back to dim but was not changing periodically. The outside lights were dim as it passed overhead, about the intensity of normal light bulbs at a far distance.

If the object were about the size of a large transport a/c, I would estimate the altitude as below 5000 feet.

Following are firm observations by myself and Margaret:

1. When object first appeared, it was as bright as brightest star to the naked eye.
2. Through binoculars, several white lights were evident at far distances.
3. Object appeared to "stop" momentarily after five minutes of flight.
4. Object appeared to rise.
