6A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THIS COMPASS NOSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU THINK THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A **" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THIS PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO SHOW WHETHER THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
