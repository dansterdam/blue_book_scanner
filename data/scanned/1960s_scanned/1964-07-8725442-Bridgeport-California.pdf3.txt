ATTN OF:	TDRVW

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 3 Jul 64, Bridgeport, Mono County, California	21 JUL 1964

TO: The USAF SAFOI (Mrs Galanti)

This is forwarding the attached letter from Mrs. --------, who has requested the investigation of an unidentified object observed the night of 3 Jul 64 by her children.

We have checked the satellite logs I and II regarding her observations, and it is possible that they observed one of the satellites in the early morning hours of 4 Jul 64. However, it is still possible that they observed one of the other phenomena which resemble satellites but may not be. It is requested that you check the files to see if any other observations were reported in that area on the same night.

We do not wish to discourage Mrs. -------- in order that her children may disclose their original observations.
