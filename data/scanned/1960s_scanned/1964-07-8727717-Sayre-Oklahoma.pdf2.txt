Dear Sir,

I would like to report the sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object.

It was seen by myself and one other person on July 13, 1964, at approximately 10:30 p.m. We were standing on the porch of a friend's home in Sayre, Oklahoma. As we watched it, it seemed to increase in size and then gradually get smaller until it went out of sight.

It appeared to be round, white in color, and paced the car we were in for a distance of about a mile while we were driving. The object gave off a steady light, did not blink, and did not leave any trail. We observed the object until it finally went out of sight. At one point, it changed direction slightly, but the motion was very rapid and stopped immediately. 

The distance between us and the object is difficult to estimate, but I would say it was at an altitude of about one-half mile. The size seemed to vary from about the size of a quarter to that of a half-dollar as it moved away.

Describing the sighting like this is rather difficult. I hope that you can get a general idea from it.

Very truly yours,
