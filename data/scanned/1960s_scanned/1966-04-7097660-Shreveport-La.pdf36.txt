THE DANIELS PARK CASE
OF
THE CASE OF THE DISRUPTED PICNIC
(This case was investigated by myself, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, on July 4, 1966. drives me to Denver from Boulder - having come up for me. Visited first... and story. Next met Mike... and we all went to visit... drove me and myself out to Daniels Park where we re-enacted the story. The case illustrated the importance of visiting the scene of the sighting. A totally erroneous impression was originally gained by the preliminary interview. Photographs attached show the reasons why.)

THE STORY
On April 7, 1966, three teen-age couples --  and ; and ; and  and ; and  and  had gone to Daniels Park, south of Denver by some 10 - 15 miles - in completely open, hilly, uninhabited territory, save for two or three houses in the distance. The territory was strangely reminiscent of the Socorro sighting -- gullies and deep wooded valleys, but much more vegetation than New Mexico. I saw it in July. In early April the foliage would not yet have been out. No establishments.
