AT WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

We (name redacted) saw a bright light moving east to west in the sky for about (redacted) minute, then it suddenly disap-peared. The light appeared very bright and glowing. It did not make any noise as I could hear and after it disap-peared there was nothing else unusual I noticed.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

Lost to sight in the distance. It just suddenly seemed to vanish out of sight at a distance.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

Yes. It was described as disappearing suddenly.
