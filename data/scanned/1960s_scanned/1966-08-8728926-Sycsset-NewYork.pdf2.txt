OCT 28 1966

Dear _____

Reference is made to your recent letter regarding your unidentified flying object observations on August 29, 1966.

ECHO I was passing over central New York on August 17, at 3:54 p.m. ECHO I, the research and development satellite, passed overhead as a radio satellite. For the first four and one-half months of its life, before solar radiation and weathering began to deteriorate its performance, ECHO I was highly visible in the night sky.

According to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalog, there are other man-made Earth satellites you may have observed. If you wish to know which specific satellite you observed, I would suggest you contact the Director, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Cambridge, Massachusetts. They maintain the responsibility of tracking all satellites and satellite components.

I hope you will find the above information useful.  Thank you for your interest in our program.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR., Lt Col, USAF
