The sighting was reported to 99DCOC through the intercession of Mr. [redacted], to whom it was originally reported by Mr. [redacted]. According to the interceding individual, this report is a reliable individual not given to flights of fancy. In fact, he states that he told the individual not to report it since he did not wish to become involved with such reports. He adds that the individual stated that he was reluctant to report it well with our cited report. Mr. [redacted] states that he did not check the time, but that it was close to dawn as already lightening in the east.
