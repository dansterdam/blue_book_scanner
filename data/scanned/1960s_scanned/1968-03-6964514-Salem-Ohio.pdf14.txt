The image appears to contain two sketches. The larger sketch shows a compass-like diagram with directional labels such as N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW. There is also some text describing the diagram and referring to a "saucer-shaped object" and a "sharper sketch". The smaller sketch shows a landscape view with a road or path leading towards some hills or mountains.

The text from the document is as follows:

"HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" AT THE COMPASS ROSE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS ROSE TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS ROSE TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND PLACE A "B" AT THE POSITION WHEN LAST SEEN. CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE PHENOMENON MOVED."
