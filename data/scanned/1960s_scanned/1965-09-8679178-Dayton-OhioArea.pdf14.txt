The image contains a diagram showing the path of an object or objects. The diagram includes a compass rose and some angular measurements, indicating that the image is intended to capture the motion or trajectory of the observed object(s). There does not appear to be any photographic image present in this particular page of the document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "X" on the object you saw above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "+" on the object where you last saw it. Place a "G" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place a "+" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the sighting.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were oriented, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
