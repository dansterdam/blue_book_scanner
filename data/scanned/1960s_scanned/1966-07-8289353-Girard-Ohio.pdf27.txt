Text from the document:

I don't say much about the body of the craft because I still believe that it was not a manufactured object from the United States. The more which we approximate the mouth of the thing, the more it reminds me of something which is apparently an automobile. This automobile has a windshield, a top, and is the size proportional to their craft. If this craft is a new experimental craft of the United States, I would be disappointed to know that. I don't believe that it was manufactured in the United States. The body of the craft appeared to be rather saucer-shaped. There was a light, a small light, which seemed to be on the top of the craft. As the craft moved, this light did not seem to be stationary, but seemed to be circling on the top of the craft. I did not notice any other lights on the craft. As I said, the craft appeared to be saucer-shaped, and it was hovering close to the ground when I first observed it.
