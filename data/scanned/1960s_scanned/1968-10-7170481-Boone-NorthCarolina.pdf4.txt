    The following report is submitted for your consideration:

    At approximtately 9:30 PM on 9/30/68, while returning home from work, I observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be travelling in a northerly direction. After watching it for several minutes it suddenly accelerated and disappeared. I can assure you that this was no aircraft. I am a private pilot and quite familiar with various types of aircraft. This light appeared to be much larger and brighter than any aircraft I have ever seen, and the speed at which it accelerated was phenomenal.

    I would appreciate it if you could investigate this incident and let me know the results. I am quite puzzled by what I saw and feel it warrants your attention.

    Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

                     Sincerely,
                     [Signature]"
