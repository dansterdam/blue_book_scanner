The image contains two photographs that are described as physical evidence, including materials and negatives. However, the image does not show any visible photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing a UFO sighting.

I. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might account for the sighting:
Called in too late to check with FAA/First Air Force.

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
1st Lt Thomas A. Emerson, UFO Officer
4713th Defense Systems Evaluation Squadron
Stewart AFB, New York

The initial interview was by telephone. The pictures were received 1 1/2 weeks after the call. A second interview (personal) was conducted after receipt of the pictures. The observer requested that the negative and photographs be returned to Mr. , upon completion of necessary studies, analysis and duplication by the Air Force. Mr. is married and employed by his father. He is quite interested in the object and his picture which is enclosed. The only thing that can be added is that Mr. and his brother developed the photographs.

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as material and photographs: Two photographs and one negative. (Both attached)
