The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

I do not have an explanation for why the automobile engine stopped and why the lights went out. She insists the ignition key was on all the time. The radio or in the air showed the ignition system was all right. The question of why the person in front of her stopped, according to her report, the same thing must have happened to him.
