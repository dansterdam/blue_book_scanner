The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve 
high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the ground where you first saw the object.

45°
30°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
