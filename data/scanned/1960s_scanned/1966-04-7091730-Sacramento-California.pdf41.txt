SOMEWHERE A KRYPTON?
Did Superspacement 
Visit Earth Once?
BY CARL SAGAN
WASHINGTON. Apr. 2 (UPI)-S trange sightings of mysterious objects in the sky over the past few decades have suggested the possibility that interplanetary visitors may be making trips to Earth, according to a scientist at the Harvard College Observatory.
As IT MIGHT APPEAR that our solar system is the only inhabited one in the galaxy, an analysis of the problems involved in interstellar travel indicates that other civilizations would be unlikely to visit us.
Thus even if this is the only inhabited world, there must be literally billions of other such worlds in the universe.
These extraterrestrial civilizations may have evolved to a point at which travel between the stars is as easy as travel across the surface of the Earth is for us.
What, then, would such visitors be like? How would they appear?
The kind of far-ranging
interplanetary travelers whose existence recent discoveries seem to
imply would be enormously larger and more massive than man. As light for the journey, they would use nuclear energy gleaned from the natural radioactivity of their craft and the cosmic rays bathing them.
Such travelers would be virtually indestructible as beings and could withstand the incredible stresses and strains involved in interstellar travel at the same speed.
Interstellar travel requires the solution of many complex problems, including the maintenance of the integrity of the spacecraft and its occupants against the rigors of the journey.
The problems are literally astronomical - such as the need for a source of energy as large as entire suns, or the problems involved in trying to avoid the dangers of meteorites and cosmic rays.
The probability of interstellar travel by creatures no larger than man is so low that virtually none of the problems involved would seem to be solvable.
If there are literally billions of other worlds in the universe, and if a significant fraction of them have developed technological civilizations, there most be literally billions of such civilizations in the universe. 
And if interstellar travel is indeed possible, it may well be that our planet is, or has been, visited by other civilizations.
