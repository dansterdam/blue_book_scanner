Dear Miss Carolyn:
Major Quintanilla has discussed the case that you reported on August 24, 1965, indicating a sighting of an unidentified object. I want to compliment you on your interest and cooperation in this matter, and to assure you that your report has been given careful consideration.
While I am going to put in a call to you to be fully and accurately informed, I did want to write you this letter to explain some of the procedures followed in the investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects and to express my appreciation for your assistance.
The importance of your report is particularly in its relation to other reports that we receive on the Air Force's continuing program of investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects. Your report, along with others, helps to provide a more complete picture of the phenomenon from which we must draw our conclusions. It is gratifying to know that responsible citizens such as yourself are willing to take the time to report their observations, and it is with the greatest appreciation that I assure you that I will give your report my careful attention.
I was particularly pleased to find that your report contained a detailed description of the object sighted, and close observations as to its shape, size, color, direction of flight, and the duration of the sighting. Information of this type is extremely valuable to our investigation, and I hope that I may have the opportunity to discuss the details of your report with you.
I assume that objects A, B and C were continuously visible for a portion of the night of August 24, and that only object D was visible on that date. Is this correct?
