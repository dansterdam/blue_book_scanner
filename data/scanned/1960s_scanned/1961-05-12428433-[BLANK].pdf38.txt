The image contains several photographs of inflatable structures in space, including an "Inflatoplane". The images show various inflatable objects and structures that could potentially be used for re-entry into the atmosphere.

STATEMENT OF ROBERT T. MADDEN, MANAGER, ASTRONAUTICS
A. LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER, NASA, LANGLEY, OHIO

MR. MADDEN: Figure 5 shows what we might consider an advanced spacecraft vehicle - a large toroidal airfromne-type con-struction. Figure 3 shows a configuration which is more representative of the type of work that we are doing today with the Langley Research Center configuration. This configuration shows our considerations at two possibilities of how expandable structures might be used in a space vehicle, and in the upper left hand side for comparison show a configuration which might be a metallic cylinder, possibly the final stage of a booster.
