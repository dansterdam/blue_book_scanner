The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page of a typed letter from Maston M. Jacks of the United States Air Force Information Division, addressed to a Mr. [REDACTED] in Rockland, Massachusetts, dated March 11, 1964.

The text of the letter is as follows:

March 11, 1964

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your recent letter in which you reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object which was observed by your mother-in-law in South Weymouth.

Your report, however, the duration was not reported and motion or the object was not included in your letter. This is insufficient for even a tentative analysis.

As you are aware, there has never been any evidence or indication that unidentified flying objects represent space ships from other planets. Observations contradict this theory. The analyses have proved those controversial if there are certain physical phenomena which may be generated by atmospheric conditions, or caused by natural bodies and their radiance or meteorites, etc.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
