The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a letter from Major Hector Quintanilla, the Chief of Project Blue Book, to a Mrs. [redacted] of Leetonia, Ohio, dated May 24, 1966.

The text in the document is as follows:

FTD (TDEV)
Wright-Patterson AFB, OHIO 45433
24 MAY 1966

Mrs. [redacted]
Leetonia, Ohio 44431

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

Reference your recent unidentified observations. The information in your letter was not sufficient for a conclusion. Because you
completed the attached FTD Form 164 and returned it in the envelope
we wish to thank you for reporting your observations to the Air
Force.

Sincerely,
/s/
HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
