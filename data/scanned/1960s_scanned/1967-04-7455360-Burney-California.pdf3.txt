The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

A talk with a friend who has had piloting experience revealed that it is entirely possible for an airplane to be flying at that altitude, at that time, in that weather, heading for the Klamath Falls airport. He suggested that the landing lights on some military craft are comparatively large, and could appear much larger due to diffraction as it passed through the snow.

Another look at the map showed that the object may have been visible over a 70-mile path under ideal conditions. The position-indicator radar fixed a point about 18 NM as the crow flies from the observer, who must have seen the object a few minutes before that.

Assuming a 20 NM visibility for the observer, the object covered 40 NM in 10 minutes, or 240 NM per hour, which is well within the range of twin-engine aircraft, and a small jet such as the T-38.

The report suggests that a small aircraft with its landing lights on flew over the path indicated at the time mentioned. Size of light caused by snow diffraction, lack or noise caused by observer sitting in car with engine running, or wind noise, or both; landing light may have been on due to emergency condition.

It may be possible to check with the Klamath Falls airport and ask them about any arrivals at this particular time.
