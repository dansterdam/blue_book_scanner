UFO Photographs, 13 November 1967

Covington, Indiana 47932

1. Reference your unidentified flying object photographs of 13 November 1967 which you submitted to the Air Force for analysis. Should this office have not completed its 'analysis program on your six photographs designated as "unidentified" objects, with the following results:

Initial review of the referenced photography revealed the "unidentified objects" were in fact a group of 5 small to medium-sized light points in the sky. An attempt was made to photograph one large and about 12 to 15 small objects, one of which was imaged (print #4). One of the remaining two photos depicted the same general pattern of 5 light points, however only at a greater distance and lessened brilliance, size and composition to that of the "unidentified objects."

An attempt was made to duplicate the star and moon paths with an identical camera and film on a night culminating on the date of the event. This simulation photographing of the moon produced only a slight photographic impression. The apparent "saucer" photo has very sharp edges and a total lack of identty
of a processing aberration. Furthermore, if the full moon could have caused this camera image, the simulation should not have produced the type of photographic image measures 1.03 millimeters. The size and composition of the spot on the "object" print indicate that this image could be that of the moon.

It is concluded that the color of the object is resolved as blue. In all four photographs the object must have been a "blind" above 650 millimeters.
