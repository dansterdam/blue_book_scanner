The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text in the document is as follows:

The field is apparently moved, and he maintains that even without the snow a landing in a suitable field would be quite difficult. He said that those craft put him in mind of little boy's toys, and it shocked him that it would be very important to get the testimony of such witnesses because the public should be informed concerning the world. He said he would report to NICAP. When I get it, I shall send you a 'carbon copy' because I am not particularly interested in the 'little boys' toys' type of incident, and moreover, it seems that in all probability no one would have wanted to see anything about this particular incident, no point out that it took me some while to make his initial report. So one can take that for what it is worth. 

P. S. Egan maintained that while this was his only experience - you see my usual way of seeing anything of an unusual nature!
