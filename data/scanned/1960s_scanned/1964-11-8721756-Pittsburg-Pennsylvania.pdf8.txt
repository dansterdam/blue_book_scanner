UFO Research.
November 6, 1964.
(Please forward)

Dear Sir, I am a Yellow Cab Driver in Pittsburgh,Pa. While working the shift from 6P in the evening until 4 morning:. I was able to observe falling stars ( as I thought they were). Upon approaching the airport I noticed that the passengers are arriving to be boarded and have noticed that strange light i was observing in the evening. Last evening i saw three that seemed to come together and lighted up the area or appeared to be landing at the airport. Mr.Washington,overlooking the Monongahela River and the downtown area,was standing on the steps,under the light when he called me to look. We both observed the light beams coming from the sky above my head,I was looking at an angle of 45 degrees so low the light beams were entering the air above me and bursting up like a searchlight a thousand feet above the ground. 
I have sighted at least twenty or these falling star like objects,and judging from the fact that these were not Y 1964,but rather 1963,for they were not stars,they seemed to land,about february 1964 at the airport.
Hoping you have some idea.This may add something to.

Sincerely,
