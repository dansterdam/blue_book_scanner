COMMANDER ALMOND STATES THAT THESE UNIDENTIFIED SIGHTINGS OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE BEINGS INTRIGUED LIEUTENANT VANCLEVE WHO CONDUCTED MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THEIR ANTICS. LIEUTENANT VANCLEVE STATED THAT THESE SIGHTINGS WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE HUNDRENDS OF EARLIER CASES. UNABLE TO EXTRACT ANY FURTHER INFORMATION, HE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS A LOCAL SIGHTING OF SOME TYPE OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. THESE BEINGS OBSERVED WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY, WERE SILENT AND CAME AND WENT IN EARLY DAWN.
