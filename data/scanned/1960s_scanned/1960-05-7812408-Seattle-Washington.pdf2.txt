Dear Sirs:

May 6, 1960, I saw my first chance to take "snap shots" of the strange sighting. I purchased a fair of 7x50 binoculars to aide my new contactor in single-shotting 35mm and Pola-color (camera to shots) to enlarge and enhance the image because we hadn't had clear sky since I bought them.

The weather report for that day was: 62-82 Fahrenheit with 15.0 k.t.s light winds at intervals.

I set the camera focus x f infinity) and the right eye piece of the binoculars fully counterclockwise (for greater telescopic range). Then, I put the camera lens right up against the central focus of the binoculars until the object filled my entire range of vision through the binoculars (I had always kept records of the exact focal point, and the elaborate equipment I had always kept records with).

I took four photos that night with Kodak 35mm film. Three were of the moon, and one with binoculars for 1/125th sec. the second was for 1/100th sec. The one of the star was blank, so I discarded it.

The first picture revealed only a fuzzy of the contours/image from the distant object. In the same slide (first frame) also reveals a relatively for image object, almost to the side of the main subject. In the success of colliding, these objects seem to form a sort of "star-speed" and also reveal a relatively less distinct to relatively more distinct gradations of light of the two objects, one being the larger and the other the smaller object relatively.
