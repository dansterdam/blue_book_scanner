BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Letter to defense asking for action against the flying saucers that are shooting down our planes and killing our "sons". Described incident where two jets were attacked by the saucers. They were told to return to base. The saucers then all the way to the enemy. In the encounter with the jets. After the supposed attack on the jets, the lady claims to have observed an atomic blast in early march to the north or her location.
EVALUATION: CASE CATEGORY
CONCLUSION: Witness probably saw something and distorted her impressions into the above tale. While the actual incident involved the lady in some way, what she saw cannot be ally judged as unusual or abnormal. There is no evidence to support the contention that flying saucers shot down jets or that an atomic blast occurred. Assuming that any A/C would report such an incident, this case is classified as an unreliable report.
