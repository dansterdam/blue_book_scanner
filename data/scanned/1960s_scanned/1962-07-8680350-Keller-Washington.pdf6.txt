Dear SIr:
I have been seeing things and need help to explain them. 
Local air personnel know nothing of them, or they fear to speak of them.
They cannot identity the many lights I have seen, but is the most outstanding is the fury of a red light fast ball meteor like object, of tremendous speed and size, that shoots across the sky in short intervals of from one to three seconds, going straight up, straight down, zigzagging, and a flash of light.
It sometimes turns dark then flashes a brilliant ruby red. It stops suddenly, hovers for a few seconds, then suddenly takes off again in a terrific burst of speed. 
This I have seen on many occasions at night and in the day. Also large dark shadow forms, that dart across the sky at tremendous speed, when coming towards one, they suddenly vanish.
I am alone in this, it seems tha rest of the world is either blind or unconcerned.
I shall be most grateful if you can throw some light on this, and tell me if this is real or just my imagination. I fear I am going stale.
I have recently taken up farming again, as I was at one time, but this worry of what I se4e is like a heavy weight on my mind.
If you or any of your staff have ever heard of similar reports I would appreciate hearing from you.
Very truly yours,
