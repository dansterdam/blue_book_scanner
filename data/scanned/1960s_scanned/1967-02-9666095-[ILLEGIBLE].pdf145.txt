The image appears to contain a diagram or sketch, but it does not contain any human faces. The diagram shows a curved horizon line, with different angle markings and a compass rose. The instructions indicate that I should act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at an early or "S" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
