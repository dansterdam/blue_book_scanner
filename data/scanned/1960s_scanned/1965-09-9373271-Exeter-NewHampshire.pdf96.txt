THE EXETER, NEW HAMPSHIRE INCIDENT
September 3, 1965

The town of Exeter is located in the southeast part of New Hampshire, just a few miles from the Atlantic Ocean. The town itself is relatively small, with a population of around 8,000 people. On the evening of September 3, 1965, a number of local residents reported seeing strange lights and objects in the sky over Exeter.

The first reports came from two local police officers, Eugene Bertrand and David Hunt, who were on patrol that night. They reported seeing a large, glowing object in the sky, which made several rapid maneuvers and changes in direction. Other witnesses, including local residents, also reported seeing similar objects and lights in the sky.

The incident generated a great deal of interest and speculation, both locally and nationally. The Air Force's Project Blue Book, which was responsible for investigating reports of unidentified flying objects, became involved in the investigation. Interviews were conducted with the witnesses, and attempts were made to identify the objects and determine their nature.

The details of the Exeter incident, including the witness accounts, the investigation by Project Blue Book, and the ongoing debate and speculation about the nature of the objects, are documented in various reports and records from the time period.
