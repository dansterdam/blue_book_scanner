The image provided does not contain any photograph or visual elements. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. As requested, I will proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text found in the document:

"having a known velocity is again reported at approximately 8:50 pm on the evening of June 8, 1962 over Beloit, Wisconsin. The speed was estimated at over 5000 mph. The object was described as round and gray in color. It was observed for approximately 1-2 minutes. The witness, a registered nurse, was with another person and both were sure this was not an aircraft or satellite. This is the second report of this type of object over Beloit, Wisconsin within the past year."
