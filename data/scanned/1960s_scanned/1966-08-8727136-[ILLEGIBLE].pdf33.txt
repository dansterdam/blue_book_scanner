1. Following incident reported to ATIC in a "FOIA" REQUEST was an unidentified flying object sited by the pilot of a USAF aircraft. On 5 August 1966, at 2230 hrs, near Pataskala, Ohio, an F-94 pilot observed an unidentified object on his radar. The object approached the aircraft on a constant course and then abruptly shot away from the aircraft at a high rate of speed.

2. Review of the sparse information available reveals indefinitely when under reported conditions of the United States Observatory unable to be caused by reflection or pilot's own aircraft from glint or glare instruments. Additional details on air mass many times gave with open.
