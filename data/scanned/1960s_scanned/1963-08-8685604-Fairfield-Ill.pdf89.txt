Air Force Probes 'Mystery Light'
WAYNE CITY, Ill. - An Air Force Intelligence officer was reported to have questioned several persons in Wayne County concerning an unidentified light in the sky.
He will question the 15 to 20 persons who reportedly saw the light when a plane flashed on and off, according to his findings to the Air Force and Dr. Allen Hynek, director of Northwestern's Dearborn Observatory.
Dr. Hynek is chairman of the project Blue Book, the Air Force's official UFO investigation organization. 
At the present stage, we don't know whether the light was associated with a plane, said Dr. Hynek from Evanston. Neither have we found a cause to account for it, said Dr. Hynek. We think this caused the light.
The light was reportedly spotted again Wednesday night from the ground in Fairfield.
