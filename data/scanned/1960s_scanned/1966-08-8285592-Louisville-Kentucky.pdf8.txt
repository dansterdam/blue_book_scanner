The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document page from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

7 Sept. 66

Below is a list of the visible stars that could have been responsible for the report at OIGO CST

Capella        50 Az    17 El    Yellow
Aldebaran      15 Az    20 El    Reddish 
Altair         250 Az   33 El    Blue-Whitish
Vega           253 Az   35 El    White

These stars should have been visible for the observation of the witnesses. The duration of the steady view and the descriptions of the objects are consistent with that of an astronomical sighting.
