THIS REPLIES TO YOUR LETTER OF MAY 6, 1969, IN WHICH YOU DESCRIBED YOUR SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO).

WITHOUT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, WE COULD NOT ATTEMPT TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU SAW. HOWEVER, IT IS THE POLICY OF THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION FOR THE CONTROL OF INFORMATION CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS TO INVESTIGATE ALL RELIABLE REPORTS THAT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AND MAKE AN EVALUATION.
