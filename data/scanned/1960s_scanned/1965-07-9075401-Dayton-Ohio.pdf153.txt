MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

Reference:	1. This headquarters memo, 9 July 1965, subject as above.

1. On 9 July 1965, the commanding officer, HQ USAF, directed this office to investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding the sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the Dayton, Ohio, area on 7 July 1965.

2. The summary of the incident is as follows:

a. At approximately 2100 hours on 7 July 1965, 2Lt John Doe, USAF, was driving his personal vehicle on the Dayton, Ohio, Beltway when he observed an unidentified aerial object hovering over the roadway approximately 500 feet in front of his vehicle. 2Lt Doe stated that the object appeared to be elliptical in shape, approximately 75 to 100 feet in diameter, and illuminated by a bright white light. He further stated that the object appeared to have no visible means of propulsion and made no audible noise. 2Lt Doe continued to observe the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view.

b. 2Lt Doe immediately reported the incident to the Dayton, Ohio, Police Department, who in turn notified the appropriate military authorities.

3. This office has completed its investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding this incident. Based on the information gathered, it is the opinion of this office that the object observed by 2Lt Doe was most likely a weather balloon or some other natural phenomenon, and not an unidentified flying object of extraterrestrial origin. Therefore, this case is considered closed.
