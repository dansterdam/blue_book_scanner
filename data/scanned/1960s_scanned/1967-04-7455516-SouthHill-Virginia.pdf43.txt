THE SOUTH HILL CASE

New evidence and insight into the UFO case that occurred on April 21, 1967, at South Hill, Va., was obtained during a two-day interview on December 16-17 and from follow-up investigations. Persons of the principal in the case, including Gifford Crowner, were interviewed. The interviews were recorded on tape.

This report has been prepared, without charge, for use by the Air Force Project Blue Book and by the University of Colorado UFO Study Group. No other use or release is intended by the author.

Even these two agencies are cautioned against public use or publication of the two paragraphs marked with a triple asterisk (***)which contain candid quotations from the interviews or author conclusions.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the general details of the South Hill case and has read the official case report prepared by William T. Powers of Northwestern University for the Air Force, dated May 10, 1967.

This case seems to this author to be an especially interesting one for several reasons:

1. It demonstrates that physical evidence which may upon superficial examination seem to provide evidence of extra-terrestrial visitations can actually demonstrate quite a different conclusion.

2. It shows how failure to report the full details of a UFO case can mislead the general public into a false conclusion that the earth has been visited by extra-terrestrial visitors.

3. It illustrates that nature seems quite adept at "hoaxes" and "tricks" that can be easily misinterpreted as some unexplainable paranormal or extraterrestrial event. (***)
