Operation Blue Book
Dear Sir,

On the evening of 12th September 1966 I was passing over Barstow Airport as usual when a bright light appeared to the West. Upon closer examination it was apparent that there was an object a considerable distance away but I approached the ground to see what it was all about up close. It was a undescribable object unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. It was round and silvery in color and appeared to be stationary. After keeping it in view for some time, as long as the largest star, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared. I was made so bright it tended to destroy night vision. The object did not show any signals or markings. The night was clear and the moon full. It was reported to W.B.2 in Boston, Mass, who I have talked to on previous occasions. This is only incident I am telling about could have reported.
Yours truly,
