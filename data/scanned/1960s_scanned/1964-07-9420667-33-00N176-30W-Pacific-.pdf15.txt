PUBLIC HEALTH
SUMMER CAMPS AND FLIES 
carried from Houses

Fly-breeding and feeding places must receive careful attention and the risk for food contamination during the summer months.

Careless disposal of garbage and refuse, uncovered garbage cans, and human excreta may provide breeding and feeding places for flies, which may carry the organisms of many diseases. 

While houses other than those where fly-breeding is directly under control may be sources of flies, the conditions of houses on the site itself should be carefully inspected and improved to the fullest extent possible. All garbage and refuse should be disposed of in a sanitary manner, and every effort made to eliminate breeding and feeding places for flies.

Fly control should be undertaken as a public health measure in the interest of the health and comfort of both campers and staff. Flies are a serious health menace and should be controlled by careful sanitation, screening, and other means available. Efficient fly control will prevent the transmission of intestinal diseases, dysentery, diarrhea and even typhoid.
