UFO SIGHTING OVER CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA., MARCH 8 - (UNITED PRESS) - AIR FORCE OFFICIALS TODAY REPORTED A STRANGE OBJECT FLASHED ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES LAST NIGHT. 
THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED FROM CAPE CANAVERAL SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN CONTROL TOWER LIGHTS WERE SEEN AS THE OBJECT FLASHED ACROSS THE SKIES, FAR BRIGHTER THAN ANY STAR OR PLANET.
AIR FORCE OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON SAID THE LIGHTS WERE BELIEVED TO BE A METEOR WHICH BROKE UP IN MID-AIR, OFFICIALS SAY THE LIGHTS DEFINITELY DID NOT COME FROM ANY AIR FORCE MISSILES OR AIRCRAFT LAUNCHED AT CAPE CANAVERAL.
THE LIGHTS "DEFINITEL DID NOT COME" FROM A MISSILE OR AIRCRAFT BEING TESTED AT THE CAPE, OFFICIALS SAID. THEY SAID THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO BE MOVING VERY RAPIDLY AND THEN BROKE UP INTO SEVERAL SMALLER PARTICLES.
ONE OFFICIAL SAID THE LIGHTS LOOKED LIKE A VERY BRIGHT GAS POCKET OR ROCKET THAT TOOK PICTURES. MILITARY OFFICIALS HERE BELIEVE IT WAS MOST PROBABLY A METEOR OR PART OF A SATELLITE BREAKING UP.
HOWEVER, OFFICIALS AT THE SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY SAID THEIR CAMERAS AND INSTRUMENTS PICKED UP NO METEOR SHOWER OR ANY UNUSUAL ACTIVITY OVER CAPE CANAVERAL LAST NIGHT. 
THE MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS WHICH INTRIGUED MANY IN FLORIDA WERE SEEN BY AIR FORCE PILOTS AND CONTROL TOWERS AND THE REPORT CONTROL TOWER AT ROANOKE, VA. ALSO REPORTED SEEING SIMILAR LIGHTS ABOUT THE SAME TIME.
BINOCULARS APPEARED TO SHOW A VERY FAST-MOVING BALL OF A MOLTEN SUBSTANCE,
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.- MAN REPORTED SPOTTING A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT FOLLOWING CLOSELY BEHIND SEVERAL LIGHTS IN THE SKY. 
AN AIR CONTROLLER AT THE RALEIGH-DURHAM, N.C.AIRPORT SAID THE LIGHTS MOVED RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SKY AND APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN A STEADY FORMATION.
THE U.S. WEATHER BUREAU IN RALEIGH SAID IT ALSO RECEIVED A NUMBER OF CALLS DESCRIBING THE LIGHTS. IT WASN'T A COMET, THE BUREAU SAID, "BECAUSE A COMET DOESN'T MOVE THAT FAST."
