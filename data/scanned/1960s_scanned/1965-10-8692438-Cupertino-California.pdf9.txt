Seemed about 6-8 feet in diameter at estimated 1/2 mile distance. This matches previous estimates I've made at times of similar UFO observation.  

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details which will help clarify the drawing, such as direction of movement, size in comparison to known objects, etc.
Place an arrow to indicate the direction the object was moving.
