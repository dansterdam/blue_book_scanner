WEIRD UFO INCIDENT IN TEXAS: On the night of September 3rd, two police officers had a terrifying encounter with a UFO near Damon, Texas. The object, 200 feet long and 50 feet in diameter, approached so close to their patrol car, that its eerie light was visible on the ground. The officers panicked and left the area at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour. Later that night they returned. The same or a similar UFO again swooped down on their car, and again they left the area rapidly. They did not come back for a third try.

The really unusual aspects of the case are the following: An open sore on one officer's arm was apparently healed by heat and light from the UFO. The policeman, named Geo Goode, had had his arm out the window of the patrol car during the sighting, and later found that an infected wound had healed suddenly.

The second wild aspect was the fact that Goode was visited by two men shortly after the incident, who told him to tell about the sighting, and advised him not to cooperate with any being on board, as he should "try to co-operate with anything he sees." The identity of these two mysterious men is apparently not known.

An on-the-spot Air Force investigation of the affair failed to solve anything. Major Lawrence R. Laiish, Jr., of nearby Ellington Air Force Base, concluded that "both officers appeared to be intelligent, mature, level-headed persons capable of sound judgment and reasoning."
