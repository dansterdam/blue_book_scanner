Dear Sir:

On Monday, September 19, 1966 at approximately 9:30 p.m., several students from the football players home after practice or some were on the tennis courts which appeared to be in the practice and above the trees which appeared on the south of the Woodson High School grounds.

There was an object which was not man-made reation, but it had a reddish orange glow and was approximately 10 feet in width and approximately 75 feet in length.

The object appeared approximately 7 miles South of Haynesville, Louisiana.

We think this is worthy of investigation.

Sincerely yours,
