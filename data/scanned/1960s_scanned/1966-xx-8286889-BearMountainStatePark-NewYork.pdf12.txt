APR 2 1 1967

Dear Mr. _______,

Reference your recent observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Your photographs were forwarded to experts for a comprehensive evaluation. They found that the object appears to be circular, indicating a substantially larger size than background stars. This suggests the object was extremely close to the photographer, the relative size of which could not be ascertained.

No other UFO reports were received from the northeastern part of the United States on December 15, 1966.

Thank you for submitting your observation to the Air Force for evaluation.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
