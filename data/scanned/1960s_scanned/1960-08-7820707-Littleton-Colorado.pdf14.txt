11 August 1960
Boulder, Colorado

On August 11, 1960, at Boulder, Colorado Driver Ray Hawis reported the stalling of his tractor engine by a large UFO, which hovered about 500 feet off the ground. He said that his engine re-started after the UFO shot up, surrounded by "heat waves". A "thrumming sound" was heard and a steady blinking of lights was seen by Hawis in his close encounter. There were also several indications of attempted or actual "touch" landings.

CLOSE ENCOUNTER IN A COLORADO COUNTY: On August 12th, a farmer in Boulder, Colorado, Frank D. reported a strange experience he had had the previous day. He said that while plowing his fields, his tractor suddenly died. He estimated the UFO to be about 200 to 300 feet from the ground, and he could see no markings. After 10 to 15 minutes the object disappeared into the clouds, and his tractor again operated as usual. There was a sort of "velvet" appearance to the object, which was maneuvering carefully, and it appeared "in and out of sight" and "didn't seem to be in any great hurry". There was an all-pervading noise, like the humming of a swarm of bees. The object was hovering, and the farmer said it was about 50 to 60 feet in diameter. He did not notice any occupants. As the object went into the clouds, the tractor again operated as usual.
