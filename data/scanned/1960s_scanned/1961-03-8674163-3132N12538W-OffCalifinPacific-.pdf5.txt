Was Montgomery County Visited By Flying Saucer?
A natural or man-made object over the Mill home as he was approaching the home. Then the object seemed to be suspended over the hill for a minute before it was lost from sight. The object was estimated to be 150 to 200 feet long, and 30 to 40 feet wide. They described it as metallic or aluminum in color and they thought it was a shooting star, then a ball of fire, and then it seemed to be in their car. The object was reported to the authorities by Mrs. Heath and Mr. Ray Heath. Mr. Heath is a retired farmer and his grandfather said that long ago they watched such an object when he was a young man. They were much interested and amazed at the object. They tried to get a better look at it, but it disappeared. A short distance from their home the object appeared in the sky. They watched it for several miles as it traveled at a very high rate of speed. Then it seemed to disappear. Mrs. Hennie McBride of Hillsboro, said that an unidentified flying object was sighted in that area sometime last year which was also reported to authorities.

Unidentified Flying Object Spotted Also In East Hillsboro
A third person called me (the writer) today to report an unidentified flying object which was spotted by several persons in the area of East Hillsboro between 5 and 5:30 p.m. on March 16, 1961. This object was also reported to the Montgomery County Sheriff's office. It was estimated to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, cigar-shaped, and was observed for about 8 to 10 minutes as it hovered over the rural area. A number of people watched it until it finally disappeared from sight.
