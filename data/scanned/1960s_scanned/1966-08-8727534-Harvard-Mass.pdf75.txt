Dear Sirs:
I am writing to tell my experience with U.F.O.'s.
One night in 1966 about 11:00 p.m. we saw a dark disc-shaped object and we started watching, out of his telescope and window. It was hovering above the trees and made no sound. At one point I heard a low buzzing sound but it may have been coming from somewhere else. The object was about 40 to 50 feet in diameter and stayed in the same position for about 15 minutes. Then it started to move slowly across the sky, without making any noise. It finally disappeared from sight. There were several of us watching this and we were quite amazed at what we saw. I hope this will be of some help to you.
Sincerely yours,
Washington D.C. 20330
