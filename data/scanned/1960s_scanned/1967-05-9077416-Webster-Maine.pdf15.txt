AFFP (UFO) Maj Quintanilla/70915/mis/21 DEC 67  DEC 21 1967
UFO Observation, 13 May 1967

Police Department

Atlantic City, New Jersey 08401

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from Trenton, New Jersey which occurred at 9:30 pm on 13 May 1967.

2. Witnesses described the object as a yellow, white, flat oval that had two high intensity lights on it. One in the rear and one in the front. There was a red strobe like light flashing on and off. It hovered and dipped below the trees and the craft was silent as it maneuvered.

3. Will you please verify any similar reports on this evening? Since detailed aerial advertising signs are often mistaken for UFO's do you have any operating over the city during the early evening?

4. Thank you for your assistance.
