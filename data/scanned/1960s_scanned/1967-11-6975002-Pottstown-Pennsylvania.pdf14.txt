The image contains two illustrations. The upper illustration appears to be a compass rose or dial, with the cardinal directions labeled. The lower illustration appears to show a landscape with mountains or hills in the distance, with a person standing on a road or path in the foreground.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

AS SOON AS SCANNING YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE A X AT OR ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE OBJECT FIRST APPEARED. DRAW A LINE FROM THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS TO THE OBJECT TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL WHEN LAST SEEN.

** 0 IT IS NECESSARY, AT TIMES, TO CLARIFY CERTAIN DIVISIONS OF THE COMPASS ROSE WHEN THEY 05 NOT SEEM TO BE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE ACTUAL DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT SIGHTED, AS RECORDED BY THE OBSERVER. COMPASS CORRECTIONS SHOULD BE MADE TO SMALL-ER SKETCHES TO ASSURE ACCURACY IN THE LARGER SKETCH.
