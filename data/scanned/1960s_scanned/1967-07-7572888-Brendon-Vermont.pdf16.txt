Dear Sirs,

Since December, 1966, I have witnessed four objects which I feel warrant attention as possible U. F. O.'s.

The first sighting occurred on Friday, December 2, 1966. Around 11:00 P.M. I glanced out the kitchen window and noticed a bright red and blinking light curving slowly from west to northeast. It was at a fairly low altitude. I don't feel qualified to estimate its size, but it was similar in appearance and slightly larger than the red light of a water tower about 1 to 2 miles from our house. However, the slower light is not visible off our patio where I was watching.

I observed the thing for about five minutes. It moved erratically, veering from west to northwest. It climbed and then it disappeared behind the houses behind our's. It apparently landed in a field between our house and the water tower.
