Dear sir:
I am on the search of my findings with serious thinking of myself as one can see from the report enclosed.
This report was written on March 29, 1962 at La Puente, California.
The document describes the observer's encounter with an unidentified aerial object on that date. It provides details about the object's appearance, movement, and the observer's attempts to get a closer look at it.
The text of the document is as follows:

Dear Sir:
On the search of my own and very serious thinking I myself with consideration as one can see from the report enclosed.
This report was written on March 29, 1962 at La Puente, Calif.
This report signifies that on evening of said date, at approx. 8:45 P.M. or 8:50 P.M., I was about to close up shop and I observed in the sky what appeared to be a very bright light.
The light seemed to almost stop and hover and then move off at a very fast speed. I ran outside to get a better look but it had already disappeared.
The light was oval in shape and seemed to be around 2 to 3 feet in diameter. It was a very bright white light, almost blinding to look at. It seemed to be about 500 to 1000 feet in altitude and was traveling in a northwest direction.
After it disappeared I went back inside and continued to search the sky but could not locate it again. I am convinced that what I saw was not an airplane, satellite, or any other known object. This is my honest report of what I observed on the evening of March 29, 1962 at approximately 8:45 P.M. or 8:50 P.M. in La Puente, Calif.
