EXCITING ACCOUNT

The witness was on top of Sagamore Hill where two Radio Telescopes are located to watch the eclipse of the moon. He noticed a bright light which was opening up from approximately 10° - No escape was at first seen as the colored lights were blinking very rapidly and constantly. He observed the object in the hovering mode for about a minute. It shot away at 45° until it disappeared. Its speed seemed much faster than conventional airborne objects. (Not conventional aircraft while time!)
