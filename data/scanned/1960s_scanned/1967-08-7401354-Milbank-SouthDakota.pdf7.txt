Dear Col. Manatt:

I refer to your letter, TDBT/UFO, of the 14 August, 1967. 

Two Black Brant VB rockets carried a barium payload for release of ion clouds. The times at which these rockets were released are given below:

(1) 0236 hours 01.08 seconds GMT on 9 August, 1967.
(2) 2303 hours 33.662 seconds GMT on 6 August, 1967.

We however, did not launch any chemical releases above information which I hope is useful in touch with a as you require further information.

Yours truly,

R. Husmann
Acting Officer of Operations,
HQ Churchill Research Range.
