On June 4, 1961, at about 10:10 p.m., a Mrs. Susan Barefield, of Eagle River, Wisconsin, observed a bright, oval-shaped object hovering near the ground about a mile from her home. She watched it for several minutes through binoculars. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and was giving off a bright white light.

After a few minutes, the object began to rise rapidly and ascend into the sky. As it gained altitude, the light became dimmer and the object appeared to change shape, becoming more circular. It then accelerated and disappeared from sight in a northerly direction.

Mrs. Barefield immediately reported the incident to the local police department. The report was forwarded to the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book for investigation.
