TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

July 11, 1963.

Capt. Craig -

I am convinced as to the nature of the object 9 have seen - it appears to be a flying saucer and as flight is concerned and as bright in the moon over Ludington, Michigan. It was 4:15 A.M. July 11, 1963. I have telephoned and reported it to the U.S. Coast Guard station and they tell me they don't know what it was as it was of massive size.

I have seen objects before and called the U.S. Coast Guard station and they tell me they don't know what they were as it was of massive size. I am a plant chemist at Dow Chemical Co. at Midland, Michigan.
