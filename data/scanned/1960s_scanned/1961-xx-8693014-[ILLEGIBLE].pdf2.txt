This is a report on a ufo sighting on that date
Light 1-2 minutes
I saw a light in the sky, it was apparently a very bright light blue-green in color, seemingly falling straight down from the sky.
It was the biggest Blinkest light I ever saw, it just fell straight down, no fluttering, just a straight steady fall, then it just went out, didnt seem to hit anything.
