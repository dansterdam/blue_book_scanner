Text from the document:

Where the land meets the sky, or are there trees in the way?
There are some trees.

What color was the object?
I would say a white and gold and yellow. Those are the colors it had during that time.

And now how bright - can you compare the brightness with something?
It was maybe the brightness of a mercury vapor.

How far away - a mercury vapor a block away or two or three blocks away?
I would say maybe two blocks away, maybe more. This was when it was white. When it was yellow and gold it was more of a softer color...it wasn't very bright, enough so that you could tell, but it seemed to go into a quarter.

Did it have any effect on your car in anyway?
No, not that I noticed.

Did you have your radio on at the time?
I don't believe I did.

What did it appear to be doing? You say following your car, but what did it do that followed your car and not something else?
First thing I noticed - the road all of a sudden looked so light and everything else was somewhat dark and I wondered what it was. I happened to glance up. I don't know where it came from, when it started, it just was there and the reason I stopped it was because when I would leave the car and I got out and started running toward the house, it seemed to be staying with me. But when I got in the house it seemed to be moving along with me.

You were in a car that had a top on it. I expect.
It was a convertible and the top was down.

What model car is it, by the way?
It's a '67 Sunbeam Alpine.

So that you were driving with the top down?
