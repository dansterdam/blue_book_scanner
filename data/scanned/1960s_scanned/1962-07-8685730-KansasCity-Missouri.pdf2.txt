"Gentlemen,

On the evening of July 22, 1962, at approximately 9:48 p.m., my neighbors and I noticed a bright object about five to ten miles in a southeasterly direction at about five to ten thousand feet. The object was hovering in an easterly direction and appeared to be about five hundred yards in diameter.

We were observing it - with a powerful monocular - which indicated that it was about six hundred yards in diameter. The object remained stationary for about five minutes and then began to move in a northerly direction at a speed of about five hundred miles per hour. After about two minutes, it suddenly stopped and began to hover again. This up and down action continued for about fifteen minutes and then the object shot straight up out of sight.

There was no sound except for an occasional "hum" which was audible for about one minute. The shape of the object was elongated and cigar-shaped, similar to that of a submarine.

I am a retired mechanic and my neighbors are businessmen. We are all persons of good reputation and have no reason to doubt our sighting. Could this possibly be identified as some type of military aircraft or secret government project?"
