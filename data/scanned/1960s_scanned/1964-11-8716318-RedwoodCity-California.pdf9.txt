Wayne walde,

I was speaking to your wife, she is a bit shaky as I was told she was quite upset when you called earlier to tell her a strange flying object has been sighted around Berkeley. I am really very sorry to tell you, there has been a tragic accident and your son David was killed in the accident.

The police officer called me a short while ago to give me the details. Apparently there was some kind of malfunction with the car and it went out of control and crashed. Your son was killed instantly. I know this must be a terrible shock and I am so very sorry. I wish I had better news for you. 

I have contacted the authorities and arrangements are being made to have David's body brought home. Someone will be in touch with you regarding the funeral arrangements. My deepest condolences to you and your wife during this difficult time. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Sincerely,
Edith H.
