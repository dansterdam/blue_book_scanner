Dear Major Quintanilla:

I would like to report to you an observation of astronomical and of possible military interest. This occurred on February 25, 1963, when it was possible to observe an UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT under the circumstances described here:

Before going into my observation I would also like to say that I had originally contacted the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, whose star Projector Planetarium is not in operation at the present time, and spoke to Mr. Philip Evans, whom I found very interested in this case. He in turn referred me to the Illinois branch of the Key Biscayne Astronomical Association.

Here, I spoke to an astronomer by the name of Lee Simons, who took all of my information and said he would advise a Dr. Hendrik, the Director of the observatory of the Chicago area, of this observation. So before contacting you directly I did check with the proper authorities on this observation.

The object which I observed was in the sky over Evanston, Illinois. Here, I spoke to an astronomer by the name of Lee Simons, who took all of my information and said he would advise a Dr. Hendrik, the Director of the observatory of the Chicago area, of this observation. So before contacting you directly I did check with the proper authorities on this observation.

The object which I observed was in the sky over Evanston, Illinois. Here, I saw what appeared to be a light, stationary in the sky, which remained there for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. I was quite concerned about this observation and wondered if this could have been some type of unidentified object or aircraft. I would appreciate your comments on this observation and any information you might have.

Sincerely yours,
