The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which describes a UFO sighting that occurred in a rectangular area of sky, subtended by a 4in x 14in object held at arm's length. The duration of the sighting was 22 sec to 30 sec, and it was reported to item D-4 of the Sighting Report. The report indicates that no weather balloons were known to be in the vicinity, and the nearest station using balloons is Albany, New York. The vertical temperature gradient and forecasted states data could not be computed due to altitudes not being given, and no temperature inversion layer was reported.
