ADVISED BY THE POLICE THE OBJECT WAS A B-58 TYPE
AIRCRAFT. B-58 AIRCRAFT WERE AIRBORNE AND IN THE
BUNKER HILL AFB TRAFFIC PATTERN AT THE TIME OF THE 
SIGHTING. HOWEVER, THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WAS SOUTH OF

NOT UNCOMMON AND COULD HAVE PLACED ONE OF THE AIRCRAFT

OVER ISOLATED AREAS IS PRESCRIBED FOR FUEL WEIGHT
REDUCTION PRIOR TO LANDING. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
INDICATES THE CAUSE OF THE SIGHTING WAS A B-58 AIRCRAFT
