The image shows a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a questionnaire with various questions related to sightings of unidentified flying objects. There is no photograph present in this image.

Now I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

39. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object? 
(Circle One)    Yes    No
IF you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate?

40. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was?
(Circle One)    Yes    No 
IF you answered YES, then how far away would you say it was?

41. Please give the following information about yourself:

NAME: JOHN T THOMAS

TELEPHONE NUMBER: 123-456-7890
