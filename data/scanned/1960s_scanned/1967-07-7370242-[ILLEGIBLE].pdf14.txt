"Spirit appeared just at treetop level. It moved away from the observer at an apparently constant pace on a horizontal course until it disappeared. The object was bright white in color and appeared self luminous. It was observed thru an open window toward the north and its brightness was greater than the brightest star and did not diminish in brightness during the observation. The entire observation lasted less than one minute. The size of the object at its closest distance away was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter and its altitude at that time was estimated to be about 50 feet."
