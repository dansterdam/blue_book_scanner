LETTERS
On March 19, 1965, a letter is to me from the Dominion Observatory, Ottawa, Canada which says:

Colorado Springs informed me by telephone that I received from the Air Force and 125' south and 120' east of Edmonton, Alta., Canada and just south of the town of Donnelly, about 90 miles southwest of Edmonton, officials of the University of Alberta and other institutions were investigating the landing area of this object.

The letter goes on to provide additional details about the reported sighting, including information on the size and location of the object.
