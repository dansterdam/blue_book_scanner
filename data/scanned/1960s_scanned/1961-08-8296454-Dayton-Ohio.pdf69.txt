The image does not contain a photograph. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, with questions and answer spaces for the witness to fill out.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
There is a hand-drawn sketch showing a curving or zigzag motion.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
The witness has written "LIKE A SATELLITE ONLY +. 7 CHANGE COURSE".

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The witness has left this question blank.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The witness has written "YES - FADED OUT (LIKE TURNING OFF LIGHT)".

24. In order that you can give us a clear picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
The witness has written "LIKE A SATELLITE ONLY +. 7 CHANGED COURSE".
