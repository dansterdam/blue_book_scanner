The image contains a hand-drawn sketch, but no photograph. The sketch depicts a "man-made lake" with a "UFO" above it, along with some text describing an observed UFO incident.

The text in the document is as follows:

"When the UFO opened up or burst open, the inner thing was a very brilliant sun-like thing, like a magnesium flare, but this light grew fainter gradually, and finally disappeared. It made a low roaring or humming sound which was rather unique, and then there were three spheres, each of which went out separately 6 or 7 different times at intervals of 2 to 3 seconds - each time the diameter of the spheres seemed larger. No fragments, or pieces, of glass were found on the ground. There was no disturbance of the grass or foliage. When the thing disappeared there was 
a
 sudden rush of wind that was felt on the face and clothing.

The UFO which I have described is the third phenomenon I have observed in over 30 years. About 2 years ago I observed a similar happening, but this time the UFO was totally unlike any aircraft or object I have ever seen or heard of before. [A sketcher's sketch is redrawn below.]
If small traces of suspected droplets of lightning had been cast from S. to N. ever so lightly as it traveled, it could not have illuminated this pattern; and the pattern was very clean-cut.
More than 20 years ago, I observed a sun-descend ball of light or fire roll along a strip of pasture in sight of several witnesses. By memory of the distance, the size must have been 15 to 20 feet in diameter. This was a vague, glow-like thing, reminiscent of a burning ember but not destructive upon this distant land. It attracted strong attention to my remark.
This was not a transient phenomenon. The fire ball rolled a distinct distance."
