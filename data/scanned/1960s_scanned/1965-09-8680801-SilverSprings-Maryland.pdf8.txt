Reference the attached report of an unidentified flying object, sighted near Silver Springs, Maryland, on 22 Sep 55. The characteristics of the sighting indicate a possible aircraft with a crescent-type light or illumination, possibly similar to the night fighters of the late World War II period. The flight characteristics are similar to an aircraft in flight, but the object was not detected on radar. There were no contrails, vapor trails, or satellites as indicated.
