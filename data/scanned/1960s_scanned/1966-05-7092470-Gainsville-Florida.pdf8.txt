There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book, with a form-like layout containing various fields and sections.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  22 May 66

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
