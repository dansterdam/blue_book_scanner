The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that describes water samples taken from a pond.

DATA ON WATER SAMPLES

Sample #1 is the water and residue from a chip of the pond ice found at the same location of the sighting. This sample was taken by a resident adjacent to the gravel pit area. See photographs accompanying this report for further data on the ice sample.

Sample #2 was taken from the pond on the afternoon of February 24. Note that road crews had bulldozed the gravel pit area in the week intervening between the sighting and collection of this sample.
