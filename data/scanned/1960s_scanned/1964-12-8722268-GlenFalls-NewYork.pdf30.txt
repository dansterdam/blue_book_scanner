Greenish-Blue Light or Fireball Seen in Sky Over Omaha
A high, swirling light in the direction of Western Electric was seen over Omaha at about 6:35 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 8, and was traveling slower than a meteor. 
It moved to the southwest and was lost from view at the horizon, according to Mrs. Anna Jones of Elkhorn, Neb.
She said it did not disappear over the horizon, but just went away.
Joe Barta, Jr. of 1327 N. Washington Street, reported to the newspaper from his bedroom window a pure white light, like a small ball, drop out of the sky and explode early Friday morning. He believed it was a meteor.
Mr. Barta said it was for a moment in the direction of Offutt Air Force Base.
The Sheriff's office and Mr. Jones made separate reports to Offutt Air Force Base.
An Offutt spokesman Friday said he could not comment except to say the reports would be forwarded to higher headquarters.
Ed Stepovich, chief of the Weather Bureau here, said bureau personnel did not see the light, indicating it was not an official weather report.
He said the length of time it was seen "seemed a little longer than usual for a meteor."
Absence of a similar reports from other parts of the Midweat indicate the light may have been just local. He said if the weather was clear, and if the light were high there should have been other reports.
