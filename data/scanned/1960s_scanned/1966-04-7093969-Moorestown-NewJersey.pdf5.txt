DATE: March 31, 1966 at approximately 3:45 P.M., a witness was looking down our driveway when an object came into view. It hovered up in the sky and then hovered back down. It had a strange metallic appearance. It hovered for approximately 2-3 minutes and then shot straight up and disappeared. The witness heard no sound while the object was present.

At 4:30, the witness observed the same object again. This time it was traveling fairly fast in a southerly direction at a high altitude. The witness had a clear view of the object and estimated its size to be approximately 60 feet long and 20 feet wide. The object was a metallic gray color, reflecting light, and was shaped like a long ellipse or cylinder. The motion of the object was only about 30 seconds. It was observed by numerous other people in the area. The direction of movement was south. The object was described as "fast" as it went straight up and disappeared completely.
