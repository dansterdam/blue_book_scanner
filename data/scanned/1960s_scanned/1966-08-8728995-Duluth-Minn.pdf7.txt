The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book, dated August 7, 1966.

The text in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7 Aug 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Date & I left the main road across the street. Looked toward the lake as the moon which brought beautiful lights in the distance appeared to grow in size as it flopped & dropped & followed a min. object that was followed by another after a quick disappearance. That is all I can tell you.
