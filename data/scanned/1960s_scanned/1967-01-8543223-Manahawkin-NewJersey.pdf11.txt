Dear Sir:

On January 26th, between 7:15 and 10:30 P.M., as we were driving north on Route 9 toward Tuckerton, we saw a very strange sight in the sky north and slightly to the west of us. 

A brilliant white and blue object which looked to be at least a half mile across the sky suddenly appeared and hovered in a straight line and at a constant level about 1/4 of the sky before. The object moved from the northwest toward the east by southeast in a straight line and at a rate of speed which was fantastic. As it traveled, the object disappeared into a cloud.

We are certain the object was not a meteor or satellite. We have seen many such before, and the object did not move or fall toward the earth. It was moving parallel to the horizon and at an incredible speed from the northwest to the east by southeast.

We would appreciate your investigation of this matter. The Coast Guard nor Navy air activity in this area, and they reported to us that they had no aircraft in this area at that time or night and also, none of their known operations above the speed or regular air traffic.

Please advise us if you require any further information regarding the sighting and direction specified.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and for your reply.

Yours truly,
