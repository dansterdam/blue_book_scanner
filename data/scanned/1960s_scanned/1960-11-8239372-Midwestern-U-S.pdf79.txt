1. This headquarters has received a report from the Project Blue Book Headquarters, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the Midwestern United States.  The report states that the object was observed on 14 October 1960 at approximately 2020 hours local time.
2. The object was observed by an Air Force officer while driving on a highway in the Midwest.  He describes the object as being pear-shaped, bright white in color, and approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter.  The object was observed for approximately two minutes.  It appeared to be hovering and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view in a northeasterly direction.
3. Since this sighting occurred in an area under your jurisdiction, I am requesting that your office undertake any investigation you feel is appropriate.  Additional information from Project Blue Book is available should you require it.
4. Please advise this office of the results of any investigation you may conduct.
