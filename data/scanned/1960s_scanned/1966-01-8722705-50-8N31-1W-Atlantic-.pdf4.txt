REPORT TEXT:
On 8 January 1966, between 0400Z and 0500Z, a visual sighting was made by a pilot and navigator of a United States Navy patrol aircraft while on a routine patrol flight over the Atlantic Ocean approximately 200 miles east of the Florida coast. The visual sighting was of a bright light which appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed. The light was observed for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared from view.

The pilot reported that the light appeared to be at an estimated altitude of 10,000-15,000 feet and was moving at a speed which was estimated to be in excess of 1,500 knots.

The light was described as being very intense and was observed to move at a downward angle and then accelerate rapidly and disappear from view. No further information or evidence was obtained regarding this sighting.
