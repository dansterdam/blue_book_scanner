The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text written in handwriting. It appears to be a page from an old report or document.

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

Ich saw the object appear in the W-NW at an elevation of about 45-50 degrees. It was stationary at first, then began to descend rapidly in a straight line to about 25-30 degrees elevation, where it appeared to lose altitude for a few seconds, then moved rapidly S and gained altitude, disappearing from sight to the S at an elevation of approximately 50-55 degrees. The object appeared to be round in shape and had a reddish-orange glow, which did not change in intensity. There were no visible appendages or exhaust. The object was estimated to be at a distance of 5-10 miles. The sighting lasted approximately 1 minute. There was a slight breeze from the W-NW at the time, and the sky was clear with some scattered high clouds.
