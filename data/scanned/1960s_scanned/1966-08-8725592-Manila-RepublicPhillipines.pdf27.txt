STATEMENT

On 3 Aug 66 while flying storm reconnaissance, the pilot brought to my attention a number of lights off to the left of our aircraft. Immediately noticed three extremely bright lights (continuous yellow/white) which appeared to be in formation.

When I first detected these lights, they were ahead and to the left of our aircraft. As they passed they gained altitude and made a 180-degree turn, crossing behind us and moving in a southerly direction away from us.

I looked for them but was unable to detect any, either visually or thru binoculars. This lights gradually disappeared from sight.
