Dear Major Jones: 

I hate to bother you again, but this is another report of an unusual phenomenon which I feel should be brought to your attention. Last night at approximately 11:00 p.m. a bright object, larger than a star and brighter, was seen hovering in the sky for a few minutes and then suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view. The object was seen by several persons and was observed for a period of about 3 to 4 minutes. I would appreciate your investigation of this incident at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
