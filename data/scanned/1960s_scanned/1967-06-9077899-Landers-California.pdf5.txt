The image appears to contain a photograph. However, since the image does not contain any human faces, I will not identify or name any individuals in the description.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

This enclosed photograph, containing what appears to be unusual unidentified flying objects, is being submitted to you with other such photographs in your files.

It is reported that on April, Wednesday, June 7, near Landers, California, while the farmer was working in his field a disc-shaped object was observed in the sky. The object remained stationary for about 20 minutes. During this time, the farmer observed the object to be rounded on the bottom and have a distinct color of a greyish hue. The temperature at the time was 78 F.

The following is an "Integratron" or "Timm transmitter" that was photographed later at approximately 1:00 PM on the same day near the same location of the aforementioned sighting. This apparent out-and-out fraud, however, is included inasmuch as there have been earlier visits to the site had resulted in unsatisfactory photographs. Therefore, I had decided to see if I couldn't get better results on the second day.

When the enclosed photograph was taken, the camera was stationary and the object is apparently the movement relative to it, resulting in the blurred image. I was attempting to catch the image as it moved from the left to the right of the frame in the sight of the observer. The lens setting was f/8.0 at 1/125 second exposure.

As a result of this incident, I don't appear to have captured what may have been a legitimate unusual flying object in the photograph. I was, however, able to record the "Integratron" or "Timm transmitter" which in itself is a development designed to hold one coil of film.
