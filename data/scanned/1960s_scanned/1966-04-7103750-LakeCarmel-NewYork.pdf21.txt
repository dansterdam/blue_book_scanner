The image contains a handwritten document that appears to be part of a UFO report from Project Blue Book. The document does not contain any photographs, but only text and a hand-drawn diagram.

The text in the document is as follows:

On April 1, 1966, my husband and I were on our way to Peekskill, when we saw an object about across our car. It appeared a little past the horizon, changing direction, went a little further, stopped, changed direction again, then disappeared. The time was 7:50 P.M. The sky was clear in this area.

[Diagram showing the object's movements]

I could see the shape of the object, and a green dome (except for the dark spot looking like a door) on the top. I't's the closest I've ever seen one. The object moved South West to North.
