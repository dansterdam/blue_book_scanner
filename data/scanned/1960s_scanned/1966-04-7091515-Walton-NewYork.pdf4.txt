Dear Sir: Registration

I have been involved in a incident with a Close Contact with a UFO. I witnessed another round red lighted object and not too long a time ago from my home at 2:15 A.M. in Wallaton, New York, I am convenced it was not a conventional aircraft or any other know object. I would like to report the details of this incident in person to the respective office that handles such information. I would also give you the location and discription of the site were this encounter took place. 
I am hoping you can arrange for a personal interview with me. 
I assure you this information is of a serious nature and of potential importance.
For my safety, I request that the interview be conducted in private.

I await your reply with anticipation.
Sincerely yours,
(Signature)
