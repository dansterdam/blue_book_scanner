Eerie Red Lights Elude Chase By Plane Here
(From Page 1)
A 4,000-foot jetliner approached the Paine Field landing pat-about 6:30 a.m. this morning and the pilot could hardly receive the control-tower contacts.
"Then the center handed us the Seattle tower to contact," he said. "The lights appeared to be 10 miles ahead."
He said that "the lights appeared to be from 6,000 to 10,000 feet above the ground - and they were not fixed. They seemed to be moving in circles and moving up and down."
"The pilot said, "When I turned directly in front of the light to make a tight circle turn, the lights appeared to be a solid formation, and I turned away again."
"These lights made a jerky, sideways type of movement as if they were swinging," he said.
"Just two seconds later, I looked over my shoulder and saw that the main body appear to split and go back together in a formation like a perfect triangle."
"Well, four lights were red, and they were changing from deep red to bright red and they were not flashing. They were solid, and they were not being picked up by our radar," he said and he told the Seattle tower of the sighting.
"WHERE'S a military formation dropping rockets or a few flares and they had no visible trail and formation is the greatest mystery. 
These lights were not plane red and not blinking - I don't know what they were."
