FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
JAN.-FEB.66 
The newspaper La Gaceta for December 17 reports that a railway worker named Gerardo Gal-
lardo claims to have had an extraordinary experience. According to his account to the police, while strik-
ing a match to light his pipe at the entrance to his railway station, he observed a strange aerial object
hovering overhead. Instead of his match flame going out, as might be expected, the paper states, a
shaft of light came from the saucer-shaped object and bathed Gallardo in its beam. Upon regaining normal
sight, he found that his pipe was unlit, and his wireless went dead. Gallardo rushed out and saw the
object for about four minutes, he says, before it moved off, varying its speed and altitude. Gallardo
reported his story to the police, passengers on the hour-ping train declared that they had just seen
on the track.
