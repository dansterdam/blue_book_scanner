35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. 
I was traveling north at about 15 miles per hour on the highway. This object was traveling in the same direction about a mile to the west at an altitude of 300 to 500 feet. Its speed was about 500 miles per hour. It was about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, round in shape, and silver in color. It seemed to wobble and turn as it traveled and was visible for about 4 to 5 minutes.
It disappeared when it went behind some trees. I have no other information that I think would be pertinent.
