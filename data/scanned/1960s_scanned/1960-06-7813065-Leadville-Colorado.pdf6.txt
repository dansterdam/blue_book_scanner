There is no photograph present in the provided image. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document containing handwritten text.

The Object is in the middle or the photograph and yet the supposed trail left by the object is in two directions from point the objects location diametrically. This discrepancy raises the probability the object making the trail.

There is no evidence of an attempt by the photographer to follow the object (panning).

The witness reported that there was no sound from the object.

If the object had been moving as fast as some distant lights, the intensity and apparent closeness of the object is improbable. Meteors and general aerodynamic vehicles of US miles per second have been heard on occasion.

From the evidence available, the ATIC conclusion is that the disc-like object on the slide is probably a lenticular cloud. The picture was probably taken through a window and the streaks which have been mistaken for a trail is due to streaks on this glass.

Further examination of this sighting by ATIC would be enhanced by determining the following from the witness:
a. The direction which he was facing when the picture was taken.
b. Was the picture taken through a closed window?
c. Were there any other people witnessed?
d. Were there any other people present at the scene of the sighting?

How far does he estimate the object moved during the time he saw it (angularly and linearly).
