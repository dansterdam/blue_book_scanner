Transcribing the text:

This report is a little different as it goes into some detail. The observer, a housewife, stated she saw a bright light in the sky that suddenly made a 90 degree turn and descended rapidly to just over the trees, about 50 feet altitude. At this close range she could see it was a large, round, metallic object with a blue-green glow around the dome. It hovered briefly, then accelerated rapidly to the north, disappearing from sight in about 10 seconds. This was in the daytime, about 11:30 AM. The observer has a good reputation and seems sincere in her report. There is no evidence of anything unusual in the sky or on the ground in this case. The sighting appears to be a genuine UFO observation, though it is not possible to determine what the object actually was.
