The image contains a photograph depicting a "Flying saucer" sighted September 11 by a motorist near Ulysses, Kansas. The text below the image provides details about the sighting, indicating that the conditions suggest this could be a possibility of the Interplanetary Intelligence of Unidentified Flying Objects (IUFOUFO), as headlined.

TEXT FOUND IN THE DOCUMENT:

tumble used rolling down the road and being driven by the wind.
The following conditions were noted by the observer during this sighting:
The object was first observed to drop to a slightly lower altitude, then resumed a steady course. The sighting lasted approximately 1500 hours in either case the sighting occurred at dawn or just before dawn. The main body was described as being approximately 40-50 feet in diameter with a dome on top in the center giving it a somewhat bulbous appearance. The detail indicated. The description of the object was a dull color similar to brushed aluminum or stainless steel. The object followed the road for a short distance, then made a sharp right turn and disappeared from view in less than 5 seconds. It was driving 50 mph and appeared to be trying to avoid the observer's car at one point. Evidence of physical effects such as landing or taking off were not observed. In all probability the speed of the object was greatly in excess of the fastest conventional aircraft operated at the time. The acceleration and maneuverability attributed to the item or other projections of the object. The circumstances for the sighting and the characteristics led to an extensive examination of the situation by the observer. The driver of the car undoubtedly contributed some element of surprise or excitement which influenced her interpretation of what she observed. No other reports were received or any Campbell's.
and any comments which he may have regarding the siting. I would like to extend my appreciation for the model of a flying saucer.
