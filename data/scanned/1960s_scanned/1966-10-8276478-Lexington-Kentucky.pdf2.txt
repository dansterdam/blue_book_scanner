Dear Sir:
This is to relate one of the most amazing phenomena i have ever witnessed. About 9:45 p.m. last evening, october 3, 1966, i was returning home from my scout meeting and let him out in the front yard. As my younger children had left out. After parking the car, i noticed a brightly twinkling star-like object about 30 degrees above the horizon. At first i thought it was a star, but soon realized it was moving from a shopping center (Eastland) about two miles distant in that direction. The object followed a straight line and all the stars in that area of the sky. The following motions were noted:
A slow ponderous small circling motion, back and forth, rising toward the zenith and sast--ward. But most astonishing and last--for five to thirty seconds--the think-shrink or pulse motion. At times impossible to detect or comprehend, it was somewhat similar in appearance to the blinking of a neon or flourescent light, but at times it nade the appearance of a swirling nebula of light. The central portion would appear to be intensely bright, even brighter than the whole peripheral band. This band would appear to slowly contract and then suddenly expand to the original size, and in its contraction all would contribute to the brightness of the central portion. Then suddenly all would contract to the brightness of the whole band. This phenomenon was observed for slightly over two minutes.  

Sincerely,
Earl
