Vandenberg Sighting Report
Weather
Lt. Col. Davis reported that there was an inversion layer at 1,300 to 2,200 ft. But it was generally reported that the objects were above the inversion. All observers indicated that the night was exceedingly clear. Lt. Col. Davis, a meteorologist, has prepared a detailed weather report, which is included as a part of this sighting writeup.

Evaluation and Conclusions
Radar Tests October 9th and November 8th
On October 9th, under weather conditions similar to October 6th but with more wind, more clouds, and cooler temperatures, the FPS-16 was fired up to determine if the same targets could be seen again. In fact, targets having the same general characteristics were acquired, but they were reported to be not as strong. Two other operators, working on an unofficial basis with a different radar, indicated that they observed "some of the same sort of stuff" on the evenings of the 9th and the 10th.
On November 8th, the night of our second visit, the same or similar targets were acquired on the FPS-16 and TPQ-13. The radar experts among those present (Blackmer, Brook, Collis, Herald, Lhermitte) immediately requested that printouts be obtained giving information on signal strength. This information was not available, because the operators didn't take steps to print it out, for the observations of October 6th and 9th.

Bias?
The behavior and characteristics of the targets appeared to be consistent with the hypothesis that was developed during the discussions.
