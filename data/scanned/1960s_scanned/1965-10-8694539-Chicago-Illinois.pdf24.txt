"At approximately 12:45 a.m. CT on 8 October 1965, I was awakened by a noise outside. I looked out the window and saw a bright light which appeared to be hovering low over the neighbor's house adjacent to mine. The light slowly moved away to the southwest. It seemed to be about 30 feet long, 15 feet high, and about 10 feet wide. It was a white light, not blinking, and did not make any noise that I could hear. The light appeared to be solid and emitting its own light. It moved at a slow pace and was visible for about 3 minutes before disappearing from sight. Subsequent to this incident, I have had some weird experiences, but nothing as dramatic as this one."
