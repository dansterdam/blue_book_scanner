There was a man-like object that I observed to the west of my home around 7:50 p.m. on May 7th. As indicated in the preceding information, it was a night-time sighting and the object was sharply defined against the sky and could clearly be seen moving from one position to another, diagonally at a slight angle, for approximately 7-10 seconds. The apparent speed (question 7c) is based on my observation of the speed - it seemed much faster than a normal aircraft. Basing their speed at 200 mph the object was going at least twice that speed or faster. That was about all I could observe about this thing. It was clearly out of the ordinary and this object was above the earth just high enough to be lost from view at that distance.
