FLYING OBJECTS SIGHTED IN STATE SKIES
HELENA (AP) - Unidentified flying objects reported in state skies during the past week range from an object moving at "terrific speed" to a blue light with a flashing red light.
One report, near Livingston, describes objects that "seemed to bounce and dance around in the sky." Another report from Miles City describes an unidentified object moving at a "terrific speed" in the night sky.
From Glendive comes a report of a "blue top and red bottom" object that hovered then moved off rapidly. Reports from other areas describe a "blue light with a flashing red light" and an unidentified object that "seemed to be rotating as it moved across the sky."
The objects reported seem to have been of various sizes, shapes and colors, and have been seen at various times of the night and day, according to the reports.
