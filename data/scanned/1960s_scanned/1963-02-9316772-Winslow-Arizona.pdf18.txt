Dear Madam,

I apologize for the delay in answering your letter of 15th March last.

I assisted Mr. Brown in compiling a report of a friend of mine, but we did not take any book samples. But I know that somebody else did.

To obtain more information about the mentioned sighting, please contact the U.M.R. Dept, of Air, Canberra. The research section there has all the details of this case.

Yours faithfully,
(R.A. Barson)
