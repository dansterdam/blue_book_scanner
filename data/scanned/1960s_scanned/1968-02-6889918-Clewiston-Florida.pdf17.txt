Dear Captain ****,

As I have met here at the Martin Marietta Corpora-
tion in Baltimore, has asked me to write you regarding a UFO sighting by me on the night of February 3, 1968.

It was flying a Lockheed Jetstar at 35,000 feet and indicating Mach 0.82. 
The weather was the best with unlimited ceiling and visibility. A bright light 
was first observed at my 11 o'clock position. This light appeared to be about 
fifteen or twenty thousand feet higher. At first, the light appeared to resemble 
a small of two car light. The light was blinking on and off at random time in-
tervals. The light would seem to go out completely and then reappear. The blinking 
was about 3oÂ§.

At about 12 o'clock, they definitely appeared as two distinct light 
sources. Each light source emitted that I would describe as a pencil beam 
cr illumination, white in color, and had a very dense and brilliant appearance 
to phosphorescent. The changes in color were subtle and did not appear mediated.

When these lights moved to a lower altitude, the rear light seemed to be out-
distancing the rear light. The rear light at this angle appeared as two distinct 
lights of the same intensity and brilliance as before. This observation was made 
at a distance estimated to be about ten miles from my position.

The time was approximately 10:55 p.m. EST. My course was a Doppler track
from PVT direct to INO. Drift was six degrees right. The total time this was 
observed was between 15 and 20 seconds. All this observation is as it was actually 
witnessed and my opinion concurs with everything as it is stated here.
