The text transcribed from the document is as follows:

The following report was submitted to SAFOID (Center - Nov. 27, 1967) and referred to NOXCN reporting ID No. P-1 - 0010. Occurred approximately 16 miles south of Mason, Texas.

Saturday morning (Nov. 25, 1967), we were on a deer stand (approximately 8 to 10 feet off the ground). We arrived there about 5:00 P.M. While looking into the sky, we saw two flying lights about 1/2 mile and they were moving in a northeasterly direction. They lighted in a field and stopped. One light became a stationary object. The second one was somewhat larger and appeared to be a blue-white color and like a star.

As 5:00 it went into a position in front of the other light. The other light went off in an easterly direction.

It was a clear, cold night.

The remaining light stayed there until nothing else could be seen in the sky in the daylight.

At about 2:00 in the morning, we heard a whirring sound, column of light appeared at the window. It was a sort bluish and remained there for about four minutes.
