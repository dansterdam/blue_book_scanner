TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

THE ORIGINAL OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS DIAGRAM. WHEN FIRST SEEN, PLACE A "1" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "2" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE OBJECT LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE OBSERVER. WHEN FIRST SEEN, INDICATE WITH A STRAIGHT, CURVED, OR BROKEN ARROW AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE INITIAL DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT. IF THIS INITIAL MOVEMENT APPEARED TO CHANGE, INDICATE THE LATER DIRECTION BY ANOTHER ARROW.
