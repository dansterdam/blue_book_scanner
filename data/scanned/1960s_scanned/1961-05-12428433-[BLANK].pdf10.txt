INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE

However, when one looks at the launch problem, it becomes obvious that a very real difficulty exists in packing a very large payload on the end of a rocket. This difficulty is associated with the fact that these large inflatable structures must not only be packed into a small volume, but must also withstand the tremendous dynamic instability which is quite large, depending on the size of the inflatable. Even careful design of something of this sort, but this is heavy. Even more importantly, how can we be associated with really large inflation, as we are showing a very large re-entry vehicle?

So that, in a nut shell, what we want to do for these large payloads is to squeeze them down into a small package on top of the booster vehicle, get it into orbit, and then in some fashion allow it to blossom into its designed shape.

Perhaps I should really say spectacular for one can have such vehicles either by inflatable or by some means of mechanical erection or some combination thereof. This is really what we are talking about. Solar collectors, corner reflectors, corner re-radiators of one sort or another, reentry vehicles, space stations, have been proposed (and perhaps inflatable ones of enormous size) as structures that one might conceive of, in which an inflatable structure would be applicable, I think you would discuss with you some of the specific work which the NASA has done on inflatable, reusable structures, and describe to you briefly some of the exploratory research which we have done at Langley Research Center, aimed at an attempt to overcome in applying the inflatable concept to a manned vehicle.

We have not been devoting a maximum vehicle. As I say, we have been studying what we would consider to be current or pertinent problems that might concern an inflatable structure of this kind. I will discuss with you some of the work which we have done and some of the technique technique to unmanned space vehicles such as Echo.

In order to try to fix what the problem areas were that we should be looking at, it was necessary to derive at some sort of a concept of what the vehicle might look like. I have some photographs here of an early version. These pictures were the result of a study which was made and were not intended to be a proposal or anything like that. It was more of a kind of a study that we would make.

If I could pass these around. They are in sequence. They start by showing what the vehicle would look like on top of the rocket. Then they show how the structure would fold up for launch, and then they show how it would unfold into its full shape in orbit. The links in this case, would be the living quarters of the crew.
