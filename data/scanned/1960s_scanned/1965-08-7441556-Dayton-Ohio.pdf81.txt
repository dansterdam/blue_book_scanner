The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with a series of questions related to the observer's experience with a UFO sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The observer's response is "---".

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
The observer answered "Yes" to this question.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The observer answered "No" to this question.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: "Rasping"
b. Color: "Chrome"

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object could have been covered by the match head?
The observer's response is blank.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show the direction the object was moving. 
The observer did not provide a drawing.
