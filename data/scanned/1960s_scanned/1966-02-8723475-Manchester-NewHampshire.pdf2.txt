The image appears to contain a letter from the Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The letter is addressed to a person from Manchester, New Hampshire and discusses their submitted photograph for analysis. 

The text from the document is as follows:

FTD (TDTR)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433
2 August 1966

Manchester, New Hampshire 03103

Dear Sir:

Reference your photograph which you submitted for analysis. A preliminary analysis has been completed, however, additional information is necessary for a more complete evaluation. This would include date and time of the photograph, camera type, camera distance to the object.

The preliminary analysis indicated:
Only one image appears on the 35mm print. This image appears to be a white ball on a 5" x 7" print. Under close examination, the image appears to be the centered reflection of some object, but there is little or no evidence of a hard image within the center of the white ball. No details are visible in the background or of the frame. You indicate in your letter that the object appeared to be brighter than the background. You also indicate that the object was smooth and dry in appearance. This type of photographic image would not be visible if the image photographed was no brighter than an air-craft light. Other similar images we have examined do not exhibit characteristics of true photographic images. They are probably the result of camera malfunction or other object recorded.  

If you will provide us with the above information we can make a more complete analysis. We appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely,

J. ALLEN HYNEK, Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
