The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, which described the Air Force's responsibilities regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Air Force responsibilities on UFO:
- To determine if there is a threat to the national security.
- To determine whether UFO represents advanced technical or scientific information.

The Air Force activities:
- A specially organized program, called Project Bluebook, that has investigated over 10,200 reported sightings since 1947.

Procedures are reviewed continuously:
- September 1965 - the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) requested a review of UFO procedures.
- March 1966 - the SAB reported on its review and made recommendations.

Points emphasized by SAB:
- No threat to the security of the United States identified.
- The Air Force program well organized.
- SAB recommendations:
  - Use a few selected universities for scientific study in the investigation of UFO phenomena.
  - Have an officer at each AFSC base skilled in investigation and available to assist the investigative teams.
  - One university or not-for-profit organization should coordinate the effort of all the teams.
- The Air Force is examining SAB recommendations, but decision on implementation has not been made.
