The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The U.F.O. COVERED ABOUT 25Â° ON THE HORIZON IN ITS PLUNGE DOWN PATH C FROM POSITION B TO D. 
NOTE THIS U.F.O. WAS A DIFFICULT ONE TO FOLLOW BECAUSE OF ITS SPEED AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT AS BRIGHT AS MY THREE PREVIOUS SIGHTINGS. IT DID PULSE OUT AND DID NOT COME TO A COMPLETE STOP, IT JUST SEEMED TO SLOW DOWN. IT LITERALLY AT RIGHT ANGLES AND SO FAST THAT I LOST IT FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AT EACH TURN. IT DID NOT FOLLOW AN ERRATIC COURSE BUT MAINTAINED THE SAME DIRECTION AND DID NOT FADE OUT IN THE HAZE BUT JUST VANISHED, AS DID U. F. O.
NO. D. OBSERVATION TIME ABOUT 1 1/2 MINUTES.
WEATHER CONDITIONS: CLEAR, COOL, FULL MOON, SOME STARS, NO CLOUDS. THE USUAL HAZE THAT HANGS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY.
OBSERVATION POINT: AN EAST WINDOW SECTION OF HUNTINGTON, W. VA.
