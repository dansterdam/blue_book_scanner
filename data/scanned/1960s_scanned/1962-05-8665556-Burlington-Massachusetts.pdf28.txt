The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document page from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) text output:

There are many inconsistencies in the report. For example:
a. Witnesses claimed they observed a "brilliant sunlight." Yet, at times, details of the alleged object were given claiming more illumination than any eye could follow it. In the distance, the distance of 3,000 ft and the size reported is inconsistent. 
b. The witness indicated that a clicking sound was heard and a small rumbling sound was heard. Some of the other statements are also inconsistent with the size and distance reported. 
c. The "normal" magnetometer of the air-drop had indicated that its reading was consistent while the object was under observation. They were unable to find any instrument that would indicate otherwise. 
d. 2 photos were reportedly taken. However, the photos were not received.
Evaluation of the sighting case remains the same. The evaluation of the Burlington sighting has been changed to other - Hoax.
