FURDIEH -- 2
INTERVIEWER'S COMMENT

I believe he observed more than during the second sighting. I believe [ REDACTED ] was too badly frightened to notice much detail. He admitted fright during the incident, but stated that he would like to see the object again.

I believe he gave a good account of his observation of the object.
