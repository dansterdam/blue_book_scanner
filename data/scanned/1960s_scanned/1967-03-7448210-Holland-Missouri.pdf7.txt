The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a document related to a UFO report. The document appears to be a cover letter from the Department of the Air Force regarding a UFO report.

Here is the text of the document:

REPLY TO
ATTN OF:	DCOI

SUBJECT:	UFO Report

TO:	TDETR, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. Reference our message DCOT 0418 Mar 67, subject same as above.

2. Forwarded for your information and exploitation is a roll of 8mm movie film which is alleged to contain photography of the same or a similar UFO as that reported in the referenced message. The information in the original report indicates that he would attempt to photograph the object and, if successful, would release the film to this organization. The enclosed film was obtained from Mr. [Redacted] on 23 March 1967.

3. Mr. [Redacted] was unable to describe the camera or to provide any information as to the type of camera or lenses, the lens opening or shutter speeds, or the processing method, except to say that the camera was "borrowed" and "wide open."

4. The enclosed film was reviewed on 23 March 1967 but available technical equipment does not permit further exploitation or a logical conclusion as to the cause of this sighting.

5. A brief evaluation of this film would be appreciated. Further, Mr. [Redacted] requests the return of the original film when exploitation has been completed.
