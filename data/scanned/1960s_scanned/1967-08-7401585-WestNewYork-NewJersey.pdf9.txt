My dear Colonel:

Pursuant to your letter dated 29 April 1966 and the results provided by the investigation as 22 April 1966 of subject sighting, I have interviewed Mrs. J. J. Witt, and she affirmed that in the summer of last year, a 60 year-old son hung an object on a piece of wire that looked like a saucer and it would not move. She stated the object was about 12 inches in diameter and would just "set" upon investigating same.

Hence it appears the incident was as I did and assured the investigator that it would be so. I am pleased to cooperate with you on matters of common interest.

Very truly,
Richard T. DeScalzo
