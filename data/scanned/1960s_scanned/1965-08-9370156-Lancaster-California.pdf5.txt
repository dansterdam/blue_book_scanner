The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a document dated August 9, 1965 regarding an incident in Lancaster, California.

Here is the text from the document:

STATED that, if it had not been for the extremely rapid increase in the sizable objects and the flashing appearance of the larger objects, he would not have reported the sighting. His final decision to make the report came only after he had observed the objects for a protracted period in the Los Angeles area.

(SSD in Los Angeles had no reports under investigation that could possibly be related to this sighting.)

He said that the objects could well have been an escort or chase aircraft. However, he stated that their rate of speed and the flashing lights eliminated this possibility as far as he can determine. No one in the area had a flight of this nature, although the possibility remains that an unidentified aircraft could not be ruled out.

Detachment /4, 24 Surveillance Sq (ADO), was queried on the possibility that these sighting were connected with a recogniTion, satellite, or some other military project. They cautioned that this didn't automatically rule out the space theory. The light did not have the dual indication that would have classed it as a satellite.

I feel that the two above explanations are the most plausible. The observer agrees that these may well explain what he saw. It is easy to see if there were an aberration or some sort involved, the observer did not feel there was anything unusual enough to regard the sighting as anything spectacular.
