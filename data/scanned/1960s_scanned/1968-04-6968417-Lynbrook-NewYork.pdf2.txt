OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
April 17, 1968
Dear___ 
This will reply to your recent letter in which you report seeing an unidentified flying object (UFO).
While additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will complete the data and return
enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to make a further analysis.
Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as possible to the nearest Air Force Base. Such base has a
investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate conclusion.
In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sighting. Thank you for reporting it
Air Force.
Sincerely,
DAVID L. STILES
Lt Colonel, USAF
