1. At approximate 1515 hours 31 July --, Colonel Mullins of AFLC called Project Blue Book office report-- that he had been in contact with Colonel Boland's office, Le-- slative Liaison, concerning Congressional Committee investigation-- the Air Force UFO Program. 
He further stated that a staff investigat-- or for the House Science and Astronautics Committee (Congressi-- al Subcommittee) Brooks, Los Angeles, Chairman) Mr. Dick Hines, was going to -- sit FID in about a week to -- 10 days, and Col. Boland suggested that -- prepare for his visit.
Col. Mullins was given Major Friends le-- phone number, and was going to give it to Col. Boland, as it is felt that it would be much to our advantage to have Major Fr-- end at FTD when Mr. Hines makes his visit.
