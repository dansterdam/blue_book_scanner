Reference your July 1967 observation of an unidentified flying object. Prior to reaching our final conclusion on your sighting we need to know the exact time the object was observed. The questionnaire you completed indicated that the sighting occurred on July 26, 1967; however, the date appears to be a note from your clarifying this discrepancy.

Dear Sir:
As you will see from my note enclosed, the date was July 27, 1967, not July 26 as I had previously stated. We think the daily was the 27th but are not absolutely certain. At any rate it was very exciting at the time and caused quite a bit of talk in the area.
