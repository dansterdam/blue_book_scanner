The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left shows a curved line representing the horizon, with a silhouetted object above the horizon. The smaller sketches on the right depict a person standing on a road or path, and a smaller circular view of a landscape.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed using optical character recognition (OCR):

32. In the following sketch at the point shown, place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline). Draw a line from "A" to show 15 degrees, or at the same curved line to show 15 degrees. 

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
