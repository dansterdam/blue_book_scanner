"UFO OBSERVATION, 1 APRIL 1963
Fort Mitchell, Kentucky 41017
The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report submitted on 1 April 1963. The sighting occurred on the outskirts of Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. The description is similar to those we have received on your radar advertising flying saucers. If your plans warrant it, we would appreciate hearing from you.
2. We would be interested in receiving a lot of response from your recent advertising for them. Our UFO reports indicate that many persons from the greater Cincinnati Valley area have been circulating reports of flying objects seen in your skies on the nights you have been flying. The Duty Officer and I would be glad to telephone calls or assisting in identifying these 'flying objects'.
3. If your plane is going to be in the Dayton area in the near future, would you drop us a note, or call us collect, as to an approximate time you are going to be there. Our office staff would like to be on hand to observe your activities.
It would be our privilege to get a first hand look at your electrical advertising. I would be of value to us in evaluating other reports from other sections throughout the United States. Our telephone numbers are:
area code 513 - 225-7095/7679.
4. Once again, thank you for your continued assistance in providing data on your aerial advertising."
