The image contains a diagram and illustrations, but no photograph. The diagram shows a sketch with a curved line to represent the horizon, and an arrow pointing to the horizon indicating the location of an object above the horizon. There is also a compass rose illustration. The instructions below the diagram ask the viewer to draw a picture to show the motion of an object or objects and to draw a picture of multiple objects and indicate the direction they were traveling.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
