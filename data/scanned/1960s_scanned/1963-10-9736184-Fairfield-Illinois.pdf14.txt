Dear Sir:
I am referring your report of the 24 NOVEMBER SIGHTING, SCOTT AIR FORCE BASE. on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force, to thank you for your cooperation.

The scientific analysis and evaluation which I have made indicates that your SIGHTING was something of an unusual nature. I have carefully examined the results of our technical investigations involving scientific analysis, and I believe that this object appears to have no identifiable value to the Air Force. I have made a detailed study of the composition and probable background of the object.

A detailed analysis of the object was made, and it appears that your object contains no substance hazardous to our materials. Therefore, your science class might be interested in our findings: Wherefore, I will send you the results of our findings soon as it becomes available. At the conclusion of this Case, I will close your case. 

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.
Captain, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
