Dear Major:

Attached is a rough (extremely rough) draft of the report that Dr. Hynek will send you on his findings in Socorro. When he returns, we will go over this and send you a more readable copy. However, until that time, I hope that this will suffice.

My best wishes to you and Sgt. Moody.

Sincerely,

Kathy Foss

P.S.: I sent Dr. Hynek a certificate for Interplanetary Blue Cross so I should hope that the Air Force does not find itself charged for one wished finger.
