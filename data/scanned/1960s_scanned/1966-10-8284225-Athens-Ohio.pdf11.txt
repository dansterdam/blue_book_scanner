14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 

THE OBJECTS WOULD VARY IN BRIGHTNESS WHILE MOVING ALONG 
THEIR PATH. THEY BECAME VERY DIM AND COULD ONLY BE SEEN BY USE OF
OPTICS AND FINALLY THEY WOULD FADE OUT. THE COMPLETE DISAPPEARANCE 
TOOK PLACE AT AN UNKNOWN DISTANCE.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?

(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know.        IF you answered YES, then tell what 
it moved behind: A __ROAD__ __MIST__ __NORTHERN__OF WORLD__TV__(_HEIGHT__25__)
 
                                           SEVERAL SCATTERED LAYERS__NO CLOUDS

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know.        IF you answered YES, then tell what 
in front of: _________________________________________________________

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:

a. Sound ____NONE___

b. Color ___VARIED D: ORANGE WHITE COLOR OF SUPER(?) WAVE (MERCURYGAS EXCITED?)___ 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how 
much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the 
sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

THE FIRST OBJECT COULD NOT BE RESOLVED BY 7X50 BINOCULARS.
THE SECOND IT EASILY BE RESOLVED BY 7X50 BINOCULARS AND 
THE NAKED EYE. BOTH OBJECTS COULD BE COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details 
of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing is show the direction the object was moving.

The drawing shows four circles depicting instances of the object's visibility and an arrow indicating an eastward direction, with some circles labeled with light levels such as "DIM LIGHT" and "BRIGHT LIGHT."
