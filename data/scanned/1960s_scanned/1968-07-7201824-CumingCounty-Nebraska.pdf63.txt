The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is an "ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AND NOTES" section, which includes information about an observer reporting a sighting to his mother and stating that he called no one else about the incident. The rest of the page contains typical report form fields such as the observer's name, address, city, state, zip code, telephone area code and number.
