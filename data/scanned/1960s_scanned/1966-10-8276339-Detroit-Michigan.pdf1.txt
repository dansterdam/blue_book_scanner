BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was oblong, bright, trailing white like phosphorus burning very bright, pink-red in middle and bright green in front. Red and green area were constant while trail varied slightly in shape. Brilliant white tail about 1 1/2 times as long as green and red area. Observer just happened to look up and at first thought he was looking at a shooting star. Object seemed to gain speed and the brilliance and size increased. Disappeared into some trees top at a high rate of speed.
