DETAILED REPORT

On 8 April 1964 at approximately 1200-1230 hours local time, a U.S. Air Force (USAF) Service member was driving near the Canyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana when he observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) over the area. 

The witness, a USAF Service member, stated that the object was observed for approximately 20-30 minutes. The object was described as a large, bright light that appeared to be hovering over the reservoir. The witness indicated that the object appeared to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter and emitting a bright, white light.

According to the witness, the object began to move rapidly across the sky, making several abrupt changes in direction before disappearing from view. No sound was reported to be associated with the object.

The USAF investigated this incident as part of Project Blue Book, their program for the study of unidentified flying objects. The case was classified as "unidentified" due to the lack of further information or physical evidence.
