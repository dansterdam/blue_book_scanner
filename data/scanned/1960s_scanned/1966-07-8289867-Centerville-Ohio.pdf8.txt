Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla
4 June

It occurred at a small airport and the duration was one half minute. Potholes should have been made to determine where were other potential witnesses. Since it occurred at night on 29 June it is possible that there were no other witnesses available.

15 August 1965, Ramona, California.
One witness, duration of sighting only 13 seconds. Was a 07 year old lady. The sighting occurred around 9:00 a.m. saying time in the middle of August, and thus the sky was still have recently brightened. Witness said sighting.

16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire
I have in my files for 26 February 1966, Manchester, New Hampshire, affidavit but do not seem to find Bartlett, New Hampshire case.

17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.
Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit Dayton.

18. 3 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.
Since by an admitted broadcast in communications the Dover Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case, say I think a file NICAP report. Evaluation pending my getting a report, the sighting is obviously unidentified.

19. 12 February 1967, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
I have only the card on this case, but judging from the investigation by low-flying birds reflecting light, the sighting was caused by 10 seconds, and witness mentioned a pitched chirping noise.

20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Loco, Texas.
I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it.
