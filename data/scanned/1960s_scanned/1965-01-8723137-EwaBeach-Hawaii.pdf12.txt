The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which contains a sketch of an object and a compass, as well as instructions and questions related to the observation of the object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curve: the time to show how high the object was above the horizon (azimuth) when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the same curve the time to show how high the object was above the horizon (azimuth) when you last saw it. Place on "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
