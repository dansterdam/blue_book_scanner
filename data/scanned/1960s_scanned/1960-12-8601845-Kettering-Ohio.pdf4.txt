The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. The page contains a hand-drawn sketch in response to a question asking the witness to "Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects." The sketch appears to be a simple shape with an arrow pointing to it, but no other details are provided.
