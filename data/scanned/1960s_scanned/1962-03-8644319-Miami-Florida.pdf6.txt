On March 6, 1962 I was observing in search of Comet 3e. Just a dark haze in the south kindled my observation. It took a minute scanning of the Parasuis Area. At 9:15 PM I observed through binoculars the Parasuis Area. At 9:20 PM I observed in direction of the 22:55 appearance I sighted in distorted formation of magnitude 1-2 appeared as strong skies in Ursa Major. They were traveling almost due eastward. They covered the sky in estuary and were now descending. They continued across the sky, going SE - it passed the western horizon and disappeared in the north northwest. 

I trained my TASCO binoculars on them, finding them difficult to interpret. Extremely small, difficult to interpret them properly."
