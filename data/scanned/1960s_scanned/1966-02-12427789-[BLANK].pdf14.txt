Dear Sir:

In reply to your letter of 15 November, 1965, with reference to your investigation of an unidentified flying object, I am submitting the following information:

The pilots aboard the ARMCO Steel Corporation Gulfstream G-157-A were Donald Swenson and the undersigned, who are employees of the company.

a. There were no unusual lights or other aircraft observed during the approach to the airport.
b. The time of landing was 1840 EST(2340Z).
c. The takeoff of the aircraft was from the northeast over the field after which a right turn was executed and the aircraft then proceeded westbound until entering a downwind leg on the southwesterly heading in preparation for landing to the northeast on the runway heading 052 degrees.
d. There is no afterburner used on the engines.

Insofar as there are wing tip and tail flashing strobe lights installed on the aircraft which we operated at the time, as well as top and bottom fuselage rotating beacons, we feel this might help in your investigation.

We hope that the above will be of some assistance to you.

Very truly yours,
E. E. Winglewish
Pilot
