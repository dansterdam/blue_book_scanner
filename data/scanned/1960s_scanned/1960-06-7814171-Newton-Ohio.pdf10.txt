Source: UFO Investigator July-August 1960

June 23, 1960, 0430 EDST, Newton, Ohio. Witnessed by a New York UFO Investigator, who was present on a field trip with a group of students. They observed a light come out of the northern sky, descend to about 100-150 feet, make a 90 degree turn and then accelerate rapidly out of sight to the west. The light was oval-shaped and seemed to be about 30 feet in diameter. It gave off a soft luminous glow and did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion. The sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds.
