Transcription of the text in the document:

I concensus that il agot about 2 to 3 per cent of the ane, I was to 50a feet high, moving west to east, silent except for a hum not a big sound no vapor trail, it seemed to descend to ground, then my attention seemed to be drawn to other witnesses to the center. Never do know how many people saw it, probably the best witness was a trucker whose name I do not have. 

It was a saucer or disk shaped aircraft, about 50 feet in diameter, of a shiny metallic appearance. It seemed to be about 200 feet high when first sighted, moving rather rapidly (estimator at 1000 mph) in a level flight from west to east. After traveling about a mile, it seemed to descend to an altitude of about 50 feet and then moved over and behind some trees, so that it was lost from sight. The duration of the sighting was approximately 30 seconds.
