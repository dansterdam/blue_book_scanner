Gentlemen:

I have written to the Air Force before and thought you might be interested in hearing what else I have to say.

When we first saw this thing, it was hovering just about the ground! No more than a foot or so from the ground. It just seemed to be floating there. When we first noticed it, it was about 200 to 300 yards away from us. As we walked towards it, it started to rise. It got up to about 100 to 200 feet in the air and then just took off at an unbelievable speed. I couldn't even begin to guess how fast it was going. It just disappeared.

The object itself was a little larger than a car, and was kind of a dull grey color. It had a slight dome on top, and we could see what looked like windows or ports all around the side. There was no smoke, no noise, absolutely nothing to indicate any kind of propulsion system.

We were dumbfounded at what we had seen, and to this day, I can't explain it. I wonder if you people might be able to shed some light on it. I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts.

Sincerely,
