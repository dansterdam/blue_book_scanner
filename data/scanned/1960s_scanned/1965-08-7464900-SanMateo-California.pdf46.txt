14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?  
It was travelling slowly in a straight line towards the east. I watched it until it was out of sight. It did not disappear suddenly.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes        (No)        Don't know.                IF you answered YES, then tell what:
It moved behind a small cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?  
(Circle One): Yes        (No)        Don't know.                IF you answered YES, then tell what:
It moved in front of a small cloud.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - silent
b. Color - white

18. We wish to know the angular size of the object. Hold up a match held at arm's length to about the size of the object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The angular size was about 1/4 of the full moon.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
