According to reports, it was around 1030 on the evening of 7 April 1962, when the scene of an unidentified flying object was observed in the sky above the Sheffield area.

The Air Ministry clarified that these sightings were the result of a known Phenomenon and pending further investigation, no further action would be taken. The incident was briefly covered in the national press, but no further details became publicly available due to issues of national security and the requirements of the Ministry of Defense for confidentiality.
