Dr. J. ALLEN HYNEK
In reviewing the Grand City Press, Michigan attitude of 3-14-67, I noted that they reported this incident, while the Air Force in their official files now on the file received no report on this case from local police nor official report. They have no information on which to act in this case.

REPORT SAID THAT RESIDENTS SAW BRIGHT LIGHTS IN SKY THURSDAY EVENING. SEVERAL POLICE CARS WERE SENT OUT FOLLOWING NUMEROUS CALLS FROM CITIZENS. POLICE REPORTED SEEING A 'FLYING SAUCER' IN THE SKY WITH COLORED LIGHTS ON IT.
