OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF, INTELLIGENCE
17 MAR 1965
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
TO: District Commander
OSI District 6
Robins AFB, GA.

The following incident was reported by Captain Howard R. Mosley, assigned to the Office of the District Commander, US Army Infantry Center, Fort Benning, Georgia, and is forwarded for your information:

"On 27 February 1965 at approximately 2315 hours Captain Mosley observed an unidentified flying object. He was at the Post Headquarters at the time, and the object was located in the northern sky, approximately 45 degrees above the horizon. The object appeared as a white light, round in shape, which began to increase in intensity and then suddenly extinguished itself. Its size was slightly larger than the largest visible star. It was located approximately 900 trail down toward the northwest and somewhat to the north of the observer. As the object approached the ground, it suddenly emitted a bluish-white glow and traveled about 10 miles in the span of about thirty (30) seconds, then the light went out. The smoke trail remained visible for about 30 minutes until dissipated by the wind. Another officer, who was nearby, also observed this object."

Request information as to whether your office is interested in receiving this type of report in the future.
