27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

The object was sighted at 9:58 P.M. on May 27. It was observed by 4 witnesses who stated that the object was moving steadily from east to west and moved in a zig-zag pattern about 30 to 35 degrees in the sky. The object disappeared after about 5 minutes.

The witnesses told that the object was much brighter than the stars and was about the size of a dime held at arm's length. They could not estimate the speed of the object but stated that it was fairly bright.

The reason why I changed my statement is because the object disappeared rather abruptly if the normal traveling pattern and this would suggest that the object may have taken flight at a high rate of speed which I feel I could not positively make an estimate on.
