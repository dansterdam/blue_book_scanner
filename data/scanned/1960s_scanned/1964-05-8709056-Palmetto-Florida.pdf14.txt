FAA reports an aircraft in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. The aircraft was on a flight from Orlando to Sarasota, arriving at approximately 2009 local time (as shown on the attached map). The aircraft was a PA22 #50302. There are five lights visible from the ground on this aircraft. The port and starboard wing lights plus two landing lights which form four lights in line. A single tail light is visible.

As stated in the attached weather report, the wind direction was 270 degrees. Under these conditions an aircraft making a landing at the Sarasota Airport would land on the runway heading east and west with the aircraft heading approximately 90 degrees. Such a landing pattern might put the aircraft over the Palmetto area sometime between 2000 and 2009 hours local time.

During a phone conversation on 15 September 1964, he amended his estimate of the object's speed to "slightly more than the speed of a jet airliner". He also emphasized that "the outline of the object was very distinct".

It is the opinion that the sighting was the PA22 previously mentioned. The cloud movement may have given the aircraft the illusion of movement from west to east (see illustration). It is possible that the craft emitted no sound. However, it might submit that the craft emitted no sound. Nevertheless, it might submit that the object was too far away to be heard and/or there may have been a fault in the observer's hearing sense. In consideration of the observer's estimate of speed, it would suggest that his estimate is inaccurate due to the fact that his is an unqualified observer.
