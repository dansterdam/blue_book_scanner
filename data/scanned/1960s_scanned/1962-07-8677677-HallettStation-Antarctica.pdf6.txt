"TD-2/Lt Col Friend
Unidentified Flying Objects Sighted in the Antarctic

TO-8: NAFE-28-62 (Major Hart)
Washington 25 D.C.

On 7 June 1962 at 0105Z witnesses at Hallett Station, TG-2, TO-50 I observed an object which they described as brighter than a star and which remained in view for about 20 minutes. The object was sighted on a true bearing of approximately 010 and the object was observed for more than 8 minutes. It appeared to be approximately 10Â° and the object was observed to be a steady white light in the atmosphere. The reported size of the object and the duration of its observation are very unusual for this area."
