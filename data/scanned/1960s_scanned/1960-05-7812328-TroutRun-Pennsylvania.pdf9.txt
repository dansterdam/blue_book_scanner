TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

This one hung suspended east of my window for at least 30 to 45 minutes. After a period of time, it slowly began to recede back and to my left, where it was still doing various circles and dives in the west. It did not or seemed not to diminish in size. I stop or in any manner attract itself to the blue-white one. It continued, if diminishing, at its own rate until it became impossible for me to observe further on account of the waning of the lights, though I could not possibly say it became part of the stars.

The blue-white one continued various passes until I lost it in the coming light of dawn.

While the details were fresh in my mind, I measured the distance - on that slant - from the base of my window, representing horizon, to the top of that high tension wire. It measured eleven inches.

Still later, I met an ex-Commander (USN) who lives in this area, and asked him, after fullest description, if in his opinion I might give their approximate height. Mr. said that one inch of space would roughly equal 10 miles. If this is so, then the objects were 110 miles high.

Upon my description of time it took the second one to recede, Mr. verified the speed of 8 to 10 miles per second.

(My letter to Mr. Maurice Rice, Department of State, Washington, D.C., together with this summary is the gist of the matter.)
