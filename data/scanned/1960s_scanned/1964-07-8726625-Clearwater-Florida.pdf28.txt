TRANSCRIPTION:

The person in this area had estimated the size of the object to be approximately 30 feet in diameter and about 10 to 15 feet from the ground. The color of the object was bluish-green and it seemed to be hovering, and then moved off at a very high speed. The witness was unable to estimate the speed at which the object departed, but said it seemed to disappear instantly. This incident occurred shortly after midnight on June 23, 1964 in Clearwater, Florida.
