UFO SIGHTING, 9 May 65, Mequon, Wisconsin

TO: HQ USAF SAFOIC (Mrs Hunt)
       Wash D C 20330

A Mr. has requested an evaluation of his observation on 9 May 1965, of a light of about third magnitude in the sky above Mequon, Wisconsin. His report is a suggested reply: 

Dear Mr.

Since you say you are familiar with the scientific type laser, you will recognize that the coherent nature of laser light makes it visible with the exception from places at which the beam is dispersed. Furthermore, the second magnitude of the object you observed indicates that the light was much brighter than this.

Plans for military aircraft in the atmosphere, such as flares, do not carry the right characteristics of an aircraft observation.
