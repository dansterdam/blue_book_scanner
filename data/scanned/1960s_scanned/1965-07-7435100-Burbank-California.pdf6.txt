The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this image.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT 

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: BURBANK, CALIFORNIA
DATE: 12 JULY 1965

PHOTOGRAPHY
A: NEGATIVE (CINEMASCOPE FRAME)
QUALITY: GOOD

1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order 65-93 from Major L. J. Quintanilla, Tr. "BLUE BOOK" to analyze one negative (filmstrip frame) taken at Burbank, California on 12 July, 1965.

2. ANALYSIS: Mr. and Mrs. KRON (initials) assisted in the analysis of the negative. The light intensities of these objects are much greater than the sky background indicating they are in close proximity to the camera. The objects appear to be two distinct entities close to each other. The light intensities of these objects are much greater than the sky background indicating they are in close proximity to the camera. This condition is reported to have existed only momentarily and the objects apparently moved on and disappeared. Assuming a haze condition existed at the time of photography, the unidentified objects could have seemed brighter than the sky background.

3. CONCLUSION: The two unidentified objects are probably a double image of reflected sunlight off some object in front of the windshield, possibly the tip of a vapor trail, onto the windshield. The identical double image could be caused by a reflection from the front and rear of the windshield glass.
