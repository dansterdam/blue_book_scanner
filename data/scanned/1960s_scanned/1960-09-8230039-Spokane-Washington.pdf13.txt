Accounts of preparing officers: Hated Air Defense Wing Flying Safety Officer. The following comments were obtained from an official of the US Weather Bureau, Spokane International Airport, qualifications unknown. "The length of time the object was observed (10 sec), the fact that the pilot observed pieces breaking off the object and the direction of flight (SW to NE) indicates the possibility the object was a man-made object (satellite?). Nevertheless, generally do not exhibit any visible break-up while they are burning out." However, the pilot could very easily have been mistaken as to the time the object was visible.
