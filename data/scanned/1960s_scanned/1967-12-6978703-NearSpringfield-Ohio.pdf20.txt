REPLY TO
ATTN OF: ITIA 8 January 1968

SUBJECT: UFO Reporting 

TO: 181 FTD (CTD/DET OPS)
WRAFB, OHIO 45433

1. On 11 December 67, a UFO was sighted in West Berlin in the vicinity of Tempelhof Airport (also used as a USAF facility) by several guards and a duty officer. The guards on duty and Air Police attempted to intercept the object, but it disappeared from one of the military group's reports stated, "a mix up with the moon is out of the question".

2. With the UFO Bible (AFR 80-17) in hand and a genuine "WPTD" representative arrive (Lt Col Klinkovski, PhD) physically in West Berlin, Det 3 was called on for advice and help. Since it's politically impossible to say "Never", we do not intend to disclose what he could in fact say. This shows we need more people (as per AFR 80-17) as those individuals involved. Now do we go from here?

3. AFR 80-17 specializes the Air Force's interest in only "UFO" as over the United States'? 3's interest showcases of its interest "if the UFO is a possible threat to the United States". In this recent incident, the Director of DIA, General Berg, personally requested FTDD's evaluation. This review even showed that no flight motion characteristics of the object was observed by witnesses that would be a threat their safety.

4. When several UFO incidents occurred 15 months ago, and IM USAFE turned to Det 3 for the answer, we forwarded all data to FTD (TDE) for their review and action. Besides an evaluation or sound advice from the experts, we requested they keep out of the UFO business, not to bother with worthless things "wasting the taxpayer's funds".

5. Request you pass this date on to the current FTD in-house OPR on UFO Reports, not so much for its evaluation as for help in furnishing Det 3 with sound and reasonable professional approach in handling these matters in the future. The formula may be simple, but we need that formula so as not to decrease Det 3's stature in this theater.
