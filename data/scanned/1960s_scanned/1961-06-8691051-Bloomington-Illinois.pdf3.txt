Concerning Unidentified Flying Object
Subject: Sighting At Danvers, Illinois 
Reported By: George C. Poehls
Danvers, Illinois

This is a report of a sighting of an unidentified flying object.
On June 13, 1961, at approximately 10:00 PM, I was driving my car southbound on Route 136, about 3 miles east of Danvers, Illinois, Mclean County. The object was first observed by me about 10:15 PM. It was almost directly overhead and appeared to be almost stationary or very slowly moving. It was a bright light, much brighter than any star, and was estimated to be about 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon. It was round or oval in shape.
In its first quarter, the object was almost directly overhead and appeared to be almost stationary or very slowly moving. After several minutes, it began to move slowly towards the southeast. After moving for a short distance, it suddenly increased in speed and disappeared from sight in approximately 10 to 15 seconds. 
The duration of the sighting was estimated to be from 10 to 15 minutes.
Cloud cover was estimated to be less than 10% and the visibility was excellent.
Respectfully yours,
