The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a scanned page from a document that appears to be a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

and tried to call the Empire Film Studio, but it was closed.
In view of the fact that the prevailing opinion in the town still
is that what Zamora saw not the result of hallucinations or of a hoax,
but a secret test vehicle, what has become of my suggestion to have this
left as"an exercise for the students"? It would be a marvelous exercise
for neophyte intelligence officers.
There is also the opinion expressed in Socorro, and expressed to me
a number of times in the past, by several people (and also by Lafaz) that
I am merely a part of a super-smoke screen and do in FTD and Wright Field,
and that the whole Project Bluebook is a grand coverup for something the
government does not want discussed. Best way to give a lie to this, of
course, is to point out that if this were the case, the U. S. government
should also have been responsible for the sightings in France, Brazil,
Spain, and in England. Maybe the U. S. government has really gone global!
On that happy thought I conclude my report.
Sincerely yours,

P. S. I now have a slightly infected/finger from the thorns on the bush that
was originally charred. The bush drew blood when I attempted to get some
soil samples. Undoubtedly, the finger will now wither away from radiation
burns. Unfortunately, I do not have interplanetary Blue Cross coverage!
