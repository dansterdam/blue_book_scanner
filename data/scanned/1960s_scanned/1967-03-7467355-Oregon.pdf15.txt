DETAILS: 
At 3:13 p.m. date, the above witnesses related the following story at the Sheriff's Office:
He stated he was driving a 1956 Plymouth station wagon, white over red, travelling South at approximately 60 miles an hour, when at the above location he observed what he described as a brilliant, extremely bright white light, hovering in a stationary position at approximately 1600 foot elevation. He stated this object was the size of a dime held at arm's length.
He stated the object was flying from West to East. It was moving slow, and then all of a sudden accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and headed South. It seemed to be under intelligent control. The witnesses further stated they continued on Interstate 5, Southbound, when they observed a bright white light hovering over the airport at approximately 200 foot elevation. This light continued for several minutes and then the object proceeded North and stopped in mid-air. The witnesses then proceeded to observe the object for some time, noting it hovered with a slight tilting motion and a swaying motion, and a pulsating light which seemed to turn on and off at intervals. The lights then proceeded towards the witnesses at a high rate of speed but the object did not come close enough for them to hear any engine noise or rushing of wind. The object then seemed to accelerate and moved in a circular motion and then the object disappeared.
