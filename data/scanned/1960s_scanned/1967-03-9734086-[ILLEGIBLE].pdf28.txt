11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
     The case is rather difficult to solve since there is no data in the file to indicate the nature of the objects photographed. The photos appear to show some type of aircraft or UFO, but without any other information it is impossible to determine what was actually photographed. More data would be required to make a proper analysis.
