There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing questions and handwritten responses.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It seemed to go behind or blurred or the glazziness had moved off.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what. Obscured

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what. Obscured

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None 
b. Color: Glistening, silvery sad

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Very little, like holding a match at some length in front of it, about 25-30 degrees anyway.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[There is a hand-drawn sketch of a circular/oval shape with the text "Spherical shape - small in several directions" next to it.]
