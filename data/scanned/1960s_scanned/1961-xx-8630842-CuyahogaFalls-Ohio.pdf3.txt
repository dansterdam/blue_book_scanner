There is no photograph present in this document. The image appears to be a page from an old report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

6 June 1961

Regarding the unclear situation/observations in your letter of 26 May, I have it in hand.

We have no knowledge of the Cuvahoga Falls, Chlcs, observation. The Air Force's initial analysis involving (?) reports did not include any such observation. We can only conclude that the ground sightings described are the reverse of those on the objects. We cannot consider any results of analyses made.

We have no knowledge of the validity, authenticity, or meaning of the enclosed (?) material which you mention, which is not further described in your letter. Regarding the cited evaluations in your letter of 9 May, I must advise that the Air Force cannot change any previous decisions as these cases were thoroughly evaluated. Data relating what they will and will not accept as evidence must be used. Essentially this means the Air Force cannot enter into any additional evaluation of these cases, as the action which does not have jurisdiction precludes further consideration.

I shall, however, discuss this situation with the appropriate agencies of the government, as any development of this nature would be of interest. As you know, the Air Force is limited in what it can do in these matters as prescribed by the Congress of the United States; however, every consideration will be given to your inquiry, which does concern a subject in which we are interested, and which is connected with the prevention of complaints of the security information.

I trust this information explains the situation as regards your letters.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM K. COLEMAN
