21. I do not wish to guess at the size.
22. The object appeared to be as large as a grape-fruit held in the hand at arms' length.
23. It rose up into the sky and sped away.
24. When the object was near the ground it looked like a glowing, dull lantern. When it was about a mile up, it looked like a shiny milk-white ball.
25. I was located outdoors when I observed it.
26. I was in the open countryside.
27. At the time I saw the object, I was driving the car. The object appeared to be hanging over the road directly in front of me. I wondered what that light was doing in the middle of the road.

32. (Blank)
33. (Sketch)
34. The weather conditions - clear sky and slight breeze - Dry and cool.
35. I reported this to no one. I have read too much on the subject, and don't care to be labeled a "nut" or a "freak".
36. Someone else was with me. My four sons. They saw it and pointed to it but we all said they would never do, They would just laugh at us about it like something in the space movies they see on television.
37. This is the first time I ever saw the subject. I was not afraid, and remembered most of the things you suppose to about the weather, etc.
38. I do not know what the object was. If anyone does, I wish they would tell me.
