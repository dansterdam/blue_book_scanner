AUGUST 16, 1966
MANSFIELD, OHIO
44205

AIR FORCE PATTERSON AIR FIELD,
DAYTON, OHIO

Attention: UFO Department

Dear Sirs:

A U.F.O. was just observed between 11:20 and 11:50 P.M. August 16, 1966 at my home. The U.F.O. was generally a brilliant yellow light moving rapidly from south-west to north-east. Movements were erratic. Occasionally it would stand still or hover, then dart off again with almost insignificance.

At first sight, I was sure it was not a satellite, as it would change directions and speeds, and at times stand still. I have observed satellites before, but this was not a satellite or a balloon. It was self-luminous.

Due to the wooded section where I live, we could only follow its path for a few degrees before it dropped behind the trees. Its speed and height would not take the necessary procedures to calculate its height. It hovered sometimes for a minute or more and I have been observing U.F.O.'s for more than ten years.

Those who observed it were: Myself, and my two daughters Mansfield, Ohio. It is my opinion that this was an U.F.O. I will appreciate an explanation of the latest two people and I would appreciate an explanation of the latest two people and I would appreciate an explanation of the U.F.O.

Objectively,
Dan R. Haber
