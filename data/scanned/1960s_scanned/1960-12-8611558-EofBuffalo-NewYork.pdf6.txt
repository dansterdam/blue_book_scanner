WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB
OHIO

Attached are the photographs described in the UFO Report submitted from the Buffalo, New York RAFT Station, dated 10 Jan 61. Bulletin B-4991, PAR. 301. 
The object was later determined to be the planet Venus as seen through the atmosphere. (Reference UFO Report from this station, dated 10 Jan 61.)
The camera was aimed and focused upon the planet and the photographs were taken approximately 15-30 seconds apart at night. Moonlight being used by the photographer to assist him in making proper lens and shutter settings. 
The sequence of the negative and prints accompanying the photographs is indeterminate, unless it results from improper film exposure or mechanics of the camera. The object was clear with the exception of a light haze, and the temperature was approximately 5,000 feet. Such clouds did not inhibit the viewing of the object. The ground was snow covered, and the temperature was approximately 10* Fahrenheit above zero.
