The image contains a sketch of a compass, as well as a drawing showing the motion of multiple objects in the sky. There is no photograph present in this image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" the course line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same course line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The text describes instructions for observing and recording a UFO sighting, including sketching the motion and relative positions of the objects.
