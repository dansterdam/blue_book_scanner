The Air Force and the U.S. Weather Bureau said they were investigating the reports with the cooperation of local law enforcement agencies. A weather bureau spokesman explained they found no unusual weather conditions to account for the sightings, and some of the sightings were tracked on radar. A USAF spokesman stated the Air Force is only concerned with the UFO reports that could be a threat to the nation's security. He said the Air Force does not either confirm or deny a report of a UFO unless it is a matter of national security. Such confirmation or denial would only come from the Air Force Chief of Information or the Air Defense Command at Colorado Springs. In connection with the Oklahoma sightings, the Weather Bureau spokesman said some of the reports could be readily explained as planets, stars and some of the sighting could not be so easily dismissed.
