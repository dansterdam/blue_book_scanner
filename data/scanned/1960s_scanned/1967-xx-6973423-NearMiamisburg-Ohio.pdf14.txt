The object was a round, light colored thing in the sky. It appeared to be stationary, remaining in the same position for several minutes. The sight was unusual and did not resemble any normal aircraft or known light source at all. It moved slowly and noiselessly, and then seemed to descend behind some distant treetops. At this point, it disappeared from sight. The object made no sound and appeared to be getting brighter rather than dimmer, not like a flare or searchlight which would normally get dimmer. The object presented an unusual appearance, being neither as bright as a star nor as dim as a satellite. Its steady, unwavering position was also unusual for any known aircraft.
