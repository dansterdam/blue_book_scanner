There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document containing handwritten text.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 8 - 9 - 66
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points
questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I FIRST THOUGHT THE OBJECT TO BE ECHO, BUT HESITATION IN MOVEMENT, THE STOPPING OR SLOWING AT 215-245 DEGREES, AND THE CHANGE IN DIRECTION SUGGESTED SOMETHING ELSE. 

THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT MAY PROVE IRREGULAR WAS HEAVY AIR TRAFFIC IN THE DIRECTION 3 HOURS AFTER MY SIGHTING MOVED IN MY DECISION TOWARD THIS OBJECT. APPEARED FOR 15 MINUTES BOTH AT CLOSE AREA IN THIS TIME.
