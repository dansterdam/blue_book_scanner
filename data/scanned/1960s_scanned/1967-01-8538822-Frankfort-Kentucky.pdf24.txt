35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or its exhaustive explanation of your sighting:

Dear Capt, 1900 EST 11/6 seen until 22:31/1967. Winchester, Montgomery County, Ky. Mc bee crossroad 0.4 miles west of Ky 60, trying to set closer to object seen moving to the northeast. Red light moving at high speed followed by 3 white lights, hovering over a light in the sky. Observed light go with sound of a loud motor for about 2 to 3 minutes, then the light went out and all was quiet. Red light was observed moving very fast, changing direction, and moving rapidly up and down. Object appeared to move at great speed and altitude. Ran toward object with flashlight but it moved rapidly and went out of sight. Extremely interesting and extremely vivid. Possibly could have been a satellite, but speed and maneuvers did not seem consistent with a satellite. No other aircraft or astronomical objects were observed in the area at the time. Possibly could have been a meteor, but speed and direction changes would not be consistent with a meteor. No sound was heard other than a loud motor-like sound when the lights were observed moving very rapidly. The incident is quite puzzling and cannot be satisfactorily explained. More details could be provided if desired.
