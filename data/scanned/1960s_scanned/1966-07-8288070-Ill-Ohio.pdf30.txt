The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on July 7, 1966 in Ohio.

Mrs. -- called on 7 July 1966 to inform us that she had also observed the meteor last night at approximately 10:55. Mrs. -- was driving west on Siebentholer, approaching the intersection of Philadelphia Avenue (which runs N to S). She was looking towards the Elder Beerman Store (slightly to the side). She suddenly saw what appeared like a falling star, arcing towards the ground (going west). Mrs. -- felt the object was approximately 400 - 500 feet when it exploded, object started to disintegrate when she was looking at. "The object came so fast, it looked quite near, disintegrated in the air." The color was whitish, bluish to red. Round then had a conical shape with tail. Could not hear any noise, though this might be due to the heavy traffic in the area. At Wright-Patterson AFB, was also riding in the car and she too observed the object. She said that it did appear as a meteor, just a little brighter than usual. Object was observed for approximately 1 - 2 seconds.
