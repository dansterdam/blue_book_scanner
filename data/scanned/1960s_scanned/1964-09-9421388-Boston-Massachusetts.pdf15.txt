The witness, Mr. Herman Sokoloff, of Newton, Mass., reported that on Sept. 9, 1964, at approximately 8:45 PM EDT, he observed an unidentified flying object over Boston, Massachusetts.

He states that the UFO was first noticed while he was driving his automobile on the Massachusetts Turnpike near the Allston-Brighton line. He said he watched the object for approximately 4 minutes as it hovered and maneuvered in the sky. 

The object was described as rectangular in shape, approximately 50-75 feet long and 15-20 feet high. It had no visible means of propulsion and made no sound. The color was reported to be a dull silver.

Mr. Sokoloff said the object was observed to make several distinct maneuvers such as hovering, accelerating rapidly, and making sudden turns. At one point, the object appeared to "flip over" rapidly and then resume its original position and heading.

After several minutes, the UFO accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view to the northeast.

Mr. Sokoloff stated that he had a clear and unobstructed view of the object throughout the sighting. He also said that he pulled his automobile over to the side of the road in order to observe the object more closely.

The report was received at the Boston office of the Federal Aviation Agency on September 10, 1964. A field investigation was made by an FAA investigator that same day.
