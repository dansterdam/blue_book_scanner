There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Dear Sir(s):
I would like to report a UFO. 
It was sited Feb. 15, 1966 at approximately 7:00 P.M. When last seen, it was traveling in a semi-circle and looked like a bright light - about the size of a half-dollar - and was about 1/2 mile south-east from my village. It disappeared behind trees. When it reappeared, it had changed to a red & green color. The size was about the same.
The sighter was made by G. Wm. Wright of Williamsburg, Mass.
