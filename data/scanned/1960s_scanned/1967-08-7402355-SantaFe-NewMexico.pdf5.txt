Transcribing the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "B" on the object or objects that you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same ground line to show the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
