The image contains a compass rose diagram but no photograph. The text on the page provides instructions for the reader to draw sketches related to the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "O" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made, from the point "X" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
