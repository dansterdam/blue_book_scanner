The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, describing an unidentified flying object sighting that occurred on 5 August 1960 between Moulis & Lille, France.

The text of the document is as follows:

"NO CASE (Information Only)

NEAR-LANDING. IN FIELD, one of the closest sightings in a long time occurred at Moulis & Lille, in France. It was seen by about 15 persons from a village. A square object of about 8-10 meters in diameter, which was very bright, round, red in color, and flew very slowly apparently for about 1 minute and from 30 to 70 meters high. The object descended to about 100 feet from the ground, and then rose again and flew away toward the north. The object seemed to give off a very bright light, and sometimes the light was reflected by the ground. The form was apparently square with a rounded top, and in the lower part there were some kind of black signs or designs. The object flew with a very slow and level flight, and there were no other witnesses."
