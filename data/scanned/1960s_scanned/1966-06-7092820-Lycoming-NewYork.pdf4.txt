Dear Sir:
I am writing to see if you can solve this mystery - a strange phenomena. On June 3rd at 4:34 A.M. my husband and I were awaken and saw a bright object in the sky. It was low, about tree top high, and shining and right. It was bright as the headlights of a car and about 5 quite large, circular, bright on the sky. My husband and I watched it for 19 minutes and 20 seconds (and I also timed it and verified this). 
Am at a quite high point on the sky, it seemed like a glowing shell.
Also, on June 5, at about eleven o'clock in the evening, a bright light appeared in the sky, about the size of a basketball, that hovered for two or three minutes and then just faded away.
The ground surrounding under the object did not reflect any light.
