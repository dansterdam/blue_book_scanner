The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project Blue Book "Photo Analysis Report" for an "Unidentified Flying Object" sighting that occurred on 10 April 1966 in Garden City, Michigan.

The text in the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 66-52
PAGE 1 OF 2 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT 28 November 1966
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION Garden City, Michigan
DATE 10 April 1966
PHOTOGRAPHY: Two negatives (B&W) and two 8x10 prints
QUALITY Poor
1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to a request by Major Quintanilla (TDSTR) to determine that likely cause of the images in question.
2. ANALYSIS: Although the images appeared genuine (as opposed to photographic phenomena), it was interesting to note, however, that source states he was approximately 300 feet from the object which was photographed. Although he stated that there was no sound, a sonic boom might well have been expected. Also noteworthy is the fact that although the camera lens parts show an insignificant degree of fogging, the object exhibited no blurring, suggesting the object was at a much greater distance. Although it is a matter for conjecture, a more likely cause for the unsharp image might have been caused by a fast moving object.
