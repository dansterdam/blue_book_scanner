Southampton again

Mr. Peter J. Kelly sends us yet another signed letter from the Southampton 5th form, dated April 29 and was witnessed by a Fifth Form teacher, David Lawrence.

David Lawrence said that when he first saw the object, it appeared was an aeroplane near the cloud height, and might have been about the size of a large aircraft.

"At a football match at Testwood ground, I was standing near my husband. When a man near me asked her husband, 'What's that in the sky?' (he lifted it to a star). Her husband replied, 'It is a cloud and they paid no more attention.

'Mr. Kelly thought it was just a small puff of cloud, but I considered it stationary and this object was slowly travelling in a north-east direction.

'It appeared as a rough disc and of a grey-coloured. It was also tilted slightly, and seemed to become brighter, in appearance it looked as if a verit out and became brighter, in my opinion."
