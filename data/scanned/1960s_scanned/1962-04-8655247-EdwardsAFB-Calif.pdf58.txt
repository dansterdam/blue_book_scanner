BREATHING-ANALYSIS OF THE DATA FROM WALKER'S RECENT SIGHTING.

As a result of the analysis of the data from Walker's recent sighting, the following information has been obtained:

1. The object was sighted at approximately 1400 local time on 8 April 1962 by the flight crew of an Air Force KC-135 jet tanker during a routine navigation flight over the Edwards Air Force Base, California, area.

2. The object was observed at an altitude of approximately 22,000 feet, or 4 miles, during the formation of the aircraft.

3. The object appeared to be cylindrical in shape, and was observed to be white in color. Its size was estimated to be approximately 60 feet in length and 20 feet in diameter.

4. The object was observed to be motionless and stationary in relation to the aircraft during the entire period of the sighting, which lasted approximately 3 minutes.

5. The object did not appear to emit any exhaust or trail, nor did it display any evidence of propulsion.

6. During the sighting, the object was observed to be surrounded by a hazy, luminous glow, approximately 5 to 10 feet in width, which seemed to emanate from the exterior surface of the object.

7. The object was observed to be completely silent and did not produce any audible sound.

8. Several attempts were made by the flight crew to establish radio communication with the object, but no response was received.

9. After the sighting, the crew made an immediate report to the base operations, and the incident was subsequently investigated by the Air Force.

10. The report concludes that the object was a genuine unidentified flying object, and that its nature and origin remain unknown.
