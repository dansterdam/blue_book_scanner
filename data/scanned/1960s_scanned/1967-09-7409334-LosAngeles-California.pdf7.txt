1. The enclosed objects were forwarded to this office by the Los Angeles Science Department for inspection and disposition since they were reported to have fallen from the sky. This station has no facilities to perform an analysis. Request your assistance in determining the content of objects.

2. One of the local papers gave this front page treatment and has thereby generated considerable interest. Any assistance you can render to provide a plausible explanation will be appreciated.
