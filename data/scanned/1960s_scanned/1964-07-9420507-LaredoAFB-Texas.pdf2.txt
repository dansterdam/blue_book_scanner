EXTRACT from Duty Officer's Report
TO: TDEX
The following, extracted from Capt Hartke's OD Report dated 27 Jul 64,
is passed for your information:
"2210 hours, UFO report from Mr. ------, 
2155 hours, UFO report from Mrs. ------
2057 hours, Received call from Maj Cockerill at USAF. He received 
a phone call from a civilian who reported a UFO near Laredo, Texas.
The object was described as round in shape, with a reddish glow, 
and was seen at a high rate of speed. It was visible for about 2-3 
minutes. The caller could not determine the size of the object, but
would give no satisfaction as to speed to the Duty Officer.
CAPT HARTKE also reported that Cockerill called and stated that NORAD related the objects
was the SCHO 1 satellite.

In this report there appear to be details about two UFO sightings reported to the Air Force, including descriptions of the objects and the times of the reports. There does not appear to be any mention of photographs in this particular document.
