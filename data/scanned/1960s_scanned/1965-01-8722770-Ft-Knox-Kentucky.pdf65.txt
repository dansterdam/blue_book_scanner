Connecticut Has January Flap
What is the other reason some reports indicate Connecticut had more than its usual number of UFO reports this January?
On Friday, 8, at Hartford, a witness reported seeing a bright light in the sky at 5:30 p.m. Two Phillips women stated they saw the object hovering and maneuvering for about 15 minutes. They said it appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and 30 feet off the ground.
A 10-year-old Glastonbury girl reported seeing a bright light in the southwestern sky at 8 p.m. on the 20th. It had "flashing blue lights" and was about 30 feet above the ground. As it passed overhead, it made a humming sound.
An A.P. man that same evening saw a strange object with two white lights in the northeastern sky at 8 p.m. It appeared to be about 25 feet in diameter and was moving rapidly toward the east.
According to the reports, these sightings were among several investigated by the Eastern Branch of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, who on the basis of their inquiries are inclined to the view that something unusual was seen in the Connecticut sky during the last few weeks.
