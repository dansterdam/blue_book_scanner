The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and text. The diagram shows a compass rose and instructions for observing an object's motion and direction. The text describes the instructions and asks the observer to draw a picture showing the motion and direction of the object(s).

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are looking at an object (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show the highest the object (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
