Investigatory Procedures

When a sighting is reported, it is the responsibility of the air base commander closest to the scene to investigate the occurrence, interview the witness(es), and complete the requisite form. The documentation (ATIC Form 164) is forwarded to the Aerial Phenomena Branch, Foreign Technology Division, Air Force Systems Command, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. There it is carefully reviewed by Project Blue Book personnel, and a check is made, as appropriate, with the cognizant specialty groups noted below. If a second investigation is deemed necessary, either Air Force or consultant personnel visit the scene of the incident, and submit a further report.

Since 1955, Project Blue Book continues to investigate only those sightings which are reported either directly to the Air Force, or via some law enforcement agency. Only sightings within the continental United States are included in these investigatory efforts. Information is prepared by the USAF Office of Information for the general public in the form of news releases and "Fact Sheets".

Consultants Provide Expertise in Many Areas

In the day-to-day treatment of UFO sightings, the Air Force team utilizes the expertise of many organizations and individuals (see Figure 3). For astronomical sightings, such scientists as Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Dr. Charles P. Olivier, and Dr. Donald Menzel are used; also, the staffs of scientific magazines (Sky and Telescope, etc.) are consulted.
