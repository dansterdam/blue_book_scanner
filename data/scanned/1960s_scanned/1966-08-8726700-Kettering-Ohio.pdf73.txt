There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page of an old document, specifically a response letter regarding a UFO sighting observation.

Dear M

Reference your recent correspondence regarding your observation and observations photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO)-. 

Examination of the submitted negative has negated double exposure and/or multiple image appearance of the negative revealed. Say smaller image is in addition to the bright light which is visible on the negative. This is rather unusual in appearance since the focus of the bright light was moved rather than the image moving to indicate the photograph was taken. Rotation around center of bright light produced this effect, normal exposure and focus was maintained. Without specific details, there is no way to determine what produced the image.

That the description of the visual observation is consistent with above conditions. The speed and motion operate is estimate, proper conditions prevail, they cannot be heard. Lack of sound is not valid reason to exclude encounter, the distorted image prevents hearing and detail recording of sighting although it was not photographed. 

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
