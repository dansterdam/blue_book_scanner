On Oct. 10, 1967, I went out on the porch of my home to look at the sky, as I often do. This was about 8:30 p.m. I saw what appeared to be a silvery object, some distance away, about the size of a basketball. It just seemed to float in the sky and did not seem to use any kind of propulsion system. 

This object appeared suddenly and remained motionless for about 7 minutes. As I watched it, it moved rapidly to the left and up, then started a jerking motion, going up, down and sideways. It then moved very rapidly away to the north and out of sight.

I asked the man next door if he had seen it, as I had called his attention to it, but he said "I cannot tell you now," but he promised he would return. At that, he turned and went into his house.

This man is a retired military officer. He stood about seven feet in eighth. He had something on his shoulders that had four gold bars on them.

That is all I noticed about this man.

Your's truly,

Oct mar 23, 1967
