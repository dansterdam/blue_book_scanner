Remarks: At about 0309, 5 June, 1954, when was at a cottage at Crystal Lake, 60 miles south of Lansing, with her husband and 10-year-old sister, she was studying history in the cottage living room. Her brother had left, saying he was going to the island across the lake to the north, and saw a bright flash of light near an island about 200 yards out. The noise immediately ceased, and, after a moment, she heard it return. About ten minutes later, the noise faded away, and became longer and louder, waking the younger sister. The younger sister became very frightened, and tried to escape into bed with her mother and took no further part in the observations. She saw the front (north) yard of the cottage lighted up brightly, as well as the bordering in the water. On such sides the water was black indicating deep sides, and when she opened the window to look out, it became so loud that she had to cover her ears. While she was at the window, an "enormous" circular object sailing into her view over her head, going north toward the island she had seen for about 60 seconds. The object seemed to be maneuvering and she felt it gave an impression of some kind of projection on top, possibly dome-shaped, and of another projection on the bottom around the lights, possibly ventricles. After it went around and passed low over the island at about the same altitude, it did not shimmer or "burn" as it went, but seem to keep the same faint familiar glowing. She was initially questioned by her father, who said that he had instructed her with the seriousness of making a false report. He said that he would investigate further.
