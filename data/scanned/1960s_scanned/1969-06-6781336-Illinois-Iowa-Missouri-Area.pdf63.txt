The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document.

As an OCR system, I have produced the following text from the document:

"IS IT STANDING STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
14. WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

Not since I have had the experience of the object and the reminiscence of the incident that it caused. It is always the part of my attention that is caught in the instance of my concern.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

I was just seen, I must say, heard of their leaving seen.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

Of course, and as I say, my concern was with the object that I saw in the air and the incident that was caused by my seeing it. The first thing I noticed was the object hovering in the air moving back and forth across my vision, I would say, between 50 and 100 feet in the air. It remained in view for possibly 2 or 3 minutes and then suddenly it appeared to drop down behind some trees which were in the distance. That was the last I saw of it."
