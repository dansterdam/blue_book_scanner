TASMANIA
Mystery object returns

I, ___________, report that on the night of May 23rd, 1959, Mrs. ___________, and I sighted an unusual object in the sky over ___________. It was about 9:15 p.m. when we first noticed the object, which appeared to be hovering about 4,000 feet above the earth. We watched it for about half an hour, during which time it moved across the sky at a terrific speed, stopping and hovering at intervals.

The object was cigar-shaped, about 150 to 200 feet long, and was illuminated by a brilliant white light that appeared to pulse or throb. On two occasions the object simply vanished, only to reappear a short distance away a few seconds later. We had the distinct impression that the object was under intelligent control.

When it finally disappeared, we stood there amazed, discussing what we had seen. The object had moved silently, without a sound, except for a faint humming noise which was barely audible. It was the most unusual and spectacular sight either of us had ever witnessed.

This is the second time in the past year that Mrs. ___________ and I have seen this same or a similar object. The first sighting occurred in June 1958, when the object was observed for over an hour as it maneuvered silently over the area. On that occasion it was seen by several other people who happened to be outside at the time.

I am convinced that the object we saw is not of this world, and I can only speculate as to its origin and purpose. Whatever it was, it is obvious that its performance capabilities far exceed anything known to modern aeronautical science. I hope this report will be of interest to your organization.
