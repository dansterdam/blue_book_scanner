It is a great pleasure to direct ourselves to you

literally means "the study of Paraair Phenomenona". we dedicate with
eagerness, sending you for your study the following attached pamphlet. -
This pamphlet was registered in 1953, in which several factors
instituted an exhaustive investigation on the part of C.E.I., to verify the
corresponding details of the above mentioned.-

We should appreciate it if your department could send us some recent, important
cases and also authorised photographs for our files.

We would also appreciate your opinion of the "flying saucers" and especially in this case which we send you.

Awaiting your reply,we are pleased to cordially greet you,

P.S. We also express our sorrow and grief for the treacherous death of the
great American, who in life was President of your appreciated country,
Mr. John F. Kennedy.

Sincerely
