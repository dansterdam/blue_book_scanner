Everything at research war was very quiet. There was a small group of people there and a table of refreshments (coffee and doughnuts). The officers were courteous and helpful but did not seem very interested in what I had to say. They asked many questions but did not seem to believe my story. I tried to explain about the strange lights in the sky but they seemed more interested in the details of my observations rather than the significance of what I had seen. I do not feel that my report was adequately recorded or that the investigation was thorough enough.
