The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter dated April 11, 1967, regarding the evaluation of an observation made on March 28, 1966.

Dear Mr. -,
Reference your letter requesting our evaluation of your March 28, 1966 observation.
Detailed photo analysis of the photograph was not possible. It is not the type of photographic evidence, and details on the photo are not clear enough to warrant any conclusion. We wish you had more time observing the objects to that a more detailed account of the observation would have been possible. A study of the satellite data did not reveal a positive explanation, but it appears that the unidentified data did not represent a close celestial body.
Attached is the photograph you made available for analysis.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
