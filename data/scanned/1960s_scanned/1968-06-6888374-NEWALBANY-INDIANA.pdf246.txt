The image contains a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a UFO report form. There is no photograph included in this particular page of the document.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
Faded out of sight

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
Yes       No      Don't know
If you answered YES, then tell what:
It moved behind a cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes       No      Don't know
If you answered YES, then tell what: 
in front of a cloud.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: silent, no sound
b. Color: silver or white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the head of the match?
Size of object is estimated to be 2 to 3 times the width of the full moon

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or sketch. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as structure, wings, exhaust and so on.
