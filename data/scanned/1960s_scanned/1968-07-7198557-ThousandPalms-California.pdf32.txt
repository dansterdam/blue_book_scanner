Transcribing the text in the document:

at about 10:10 pm on 24 June 1968, he and his family members were outside their home in Thousand Palms, California, when they observed a very bright object in the sky. The object was described as circular in shape, glowing yellow-orange in color, and appeared to be at an elevation of about 30 degrees. It remained stationary for approximately 2-3 minutes before rapidly accelerating and disappearing from view. The witness stated that the object was much larger and brighter than any conventional aircraft, and that it made no sound. He estimated that the object was approximately 1 mile in diameter. The witness reported the incident to the local sheriff's office, who in turn notified the nearby Norton Air Force Base.
