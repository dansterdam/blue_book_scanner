The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch appears to be a compass rose or directional indicator, with labels for the cardinal and intercardinal directions. The smaller sketches depict two landscape scenes, showing a person standing on a road or path leading into a distant horizon.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"AS NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW A LINE TO CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS. THIS WILL GIVE AN INDICATION OF THE DIRECTION OF FLIGHT. THE LARGER SKETCH."
