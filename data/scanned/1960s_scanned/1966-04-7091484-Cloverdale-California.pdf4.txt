There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document or letter.

From what I can see in the text, it discusses some kind of unusual or unexplained phenomena that the author has witnessed or heard about. The author mentions "such things as aren't normal bodies" and seems to suggest that there is something cryptic or mysterious about the "phenomena". They also express interest in hearing more about what the reader may know about this topic.

I have produced and output all the text found in the document, which is as follows:

From what I read they are all one going from that to Coast. I have read that their are such things as aren't normal bodies but at the present going a too crpital of the phenomena. Since what we are their most, if they've a changed maybe this could be an explanation. We would very much like to hear from you do to what they could possibly be.
