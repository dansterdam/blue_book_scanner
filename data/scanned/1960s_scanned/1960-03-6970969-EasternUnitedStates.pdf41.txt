The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report documenting a sighting of what is described as a possible reentry of some variety of ballistic missile or earth satellite vehicle.

22 MARCH 1960

DEFENSE CHIEF, COMBAT INTELLIGENCE BRANCH, WING INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, 72ND BOMBARDMENT WING. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THIS SIGHTING WOULD INDICATE A POSSIBLE REENTRY OF SOME VARIETY OF BALLISTIC MISSILE OR EARTH SATELLITE VEHICLE. THE MANNER IN WHICH OBJECT DISAPPEARED (SEE ITEM 6C5 ABOVE) IS THE PRIMARY SUPPORT FOR THIS ANALYSIS. ALTHOUGH THE ESTIMATED DURATION WHEN FIRST SIGHTED COMPARED TO AZIMUTH UPON DISAPPEARANCE WOULD INDICATE MOVEMENT FROM EAST TO WEST OBSERVER WAS NOT POSITIVE OF THESE FIGURES, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EXTREMELY SHORT TIME THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED. BECAUSE OF THE SHORT DURATION OF THIS SIGHTING, DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT AS INDICATED IN ITEM 6C5 ABOVE IS NOT CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELY RELIABLE BY THE PREPARING OFFICER.
