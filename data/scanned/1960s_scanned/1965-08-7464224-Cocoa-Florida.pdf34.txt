Colorful Objects 
Seen in Cocoa Sky
By Sanders Lamont and James K. Yates, also reported seeing these objects in the sky above the police station. 
COCOA - Multi-colored objects were reported Wednesday by eight persons, said to have been seen for about an hour in the sky over Cocoa.
The first report came at 9:24 p.m. Wednesday from an individual who said the objects were 5 to 6 miles northeast of town.
The objects were described as brightly colored and changing color as they moved about in the sky, with the observers estimating them to be about the size of a standard automobile. They were said to move slowly and were visible for about an hour. The objects were first sighted about 9 p.m. and were last seen at 10 p.m.
The unidentified objects are assumed to be some type of aircraft, but neither the Air Force nor the CAA base in Melbourne has any knowledge of planes in that area at that time.
Command at the Patrick Air Force Base said no planes were known to be in the area, and the CAA base in Melbourne also said they have no information on any aircraft in the sky over Cocoa at the time the objects were reported.
The observers, who were not identified, claim the objects were easily visible and were seen by several persons. They were described as being round and saucer-shaped, and were said to move about rapidly yet silently. Flashing of different colored lights, blue, green, yellow and red, was also reported during the time the objects were under observation.
