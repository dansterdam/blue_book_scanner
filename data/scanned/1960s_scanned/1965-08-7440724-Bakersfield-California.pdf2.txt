TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

SEP 29 1965

Dear Mr. ---------,

This is in reply to your letter concerning unidentified flying objects.

Your first observation is very similar to an observation of an infra-red photo solution. The colors, slow speed, and noise are all characteristic of this type of observation. The solution is caused by a generator which is used to generate the gas which is used to operate the seeker on certain types of missiles.

Your observation on 1 September 1965 can be attributed to a test aircraft flying at a high altitude.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING
