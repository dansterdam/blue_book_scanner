To Appeared to be going to agamet 
pndolation (sic) any thought of an earthly type 
a small object not very prominent but dis
tiguished from others with it. Passing in a
long arc at moderate speed. Another very 
similar object passed in the opposite direction
following almost the same path in not quite
so long an arc. These objects gave no details
of structure which could be determined from
the observation. The nature and origin of these
objects is highly speculative.
