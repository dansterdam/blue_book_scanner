Transcribed text from the document:

On 9 March 1965, at approximately 1835 hours, a bright light was observed over the Pyramid Lake near Sutcliffe, Nevada, by Miss Arlene Sloan, a resident of Sutcliffe. The light was first observed moving over the lake from the northeast to the southwest, then it stopped and hovered for approximately 5 minutes. It then moved to the northeast and disappeared from sight.

Miss Sloan described the light as being quite bright, about the size of a basketball, and making no sound. She also stated that the light seemed to cast no reflection on the surface of the lake. The object was observed through a window of Miss Sloan's home.

The weather at the time was clear and Miss Sloan had an unobstructed view of the lake. The light was observed for a total of approximately 10 minutes.
