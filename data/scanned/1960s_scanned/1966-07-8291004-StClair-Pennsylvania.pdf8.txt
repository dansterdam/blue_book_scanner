Waterfalls of bright light appeared at first. This light gathered in a ball of bright white light that appeared to be hovering. The light would pulsate and send out rays of light and then draw them back in. This happened for about 5 or 10 minutes. The light then seemed to become smaller and more condensed and then it appeared to go up and away. There was no noise associated with the object. It was seen from a distance of about 1/2 mile and seemed to be 2,000 to 3,000 feet in the air. There were no clouds in the sky and the sky was very clear. This object did not seem to be an aircraft. It did not have any lights or markings of any kind. It just appeared to be a ball of light. This occurred on a farm in the country approximately 6 miles north of Hickory, Pennsylvania. The time was approximately 8:15 p.m. The weather was cool and clear.
