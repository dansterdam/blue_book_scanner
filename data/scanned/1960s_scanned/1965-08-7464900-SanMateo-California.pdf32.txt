The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Two UFO sighting were observed from the Coyote Vista area of San Mateo, California on the afternoon of August 7, 1965. The incident was reported to the U.S. Air Force and an investigation followed.

The observers, William H. Jewell and his wife Elizabeth, were viewing the western horizon from their home at the time. They observed two round, light-colored objects which appeared to be hovering in the sky. The objects were observed for several minutes before they moved away rapidly and disappeared from sight.

The Jewells said the objects seemed to be metallic and were reflecting the sun's rays. They also said the objects moved very rapidly and disappeared into the northwest.
