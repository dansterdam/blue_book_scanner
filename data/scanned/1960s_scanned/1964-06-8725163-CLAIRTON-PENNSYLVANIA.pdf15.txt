The provided image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

DTO HEARING, Pittsburgh, Pa., 22 May & 25 Jun 64
CAS NO. 6-0330
REFERENCE the attached letter and photographs from Mrs. Franes E. HUNT, CLAIRTON, Pa. 
Recommend the attached letter and photograph be filed for record. The narrative appears to be consistent and the photograph appears to possibly be of an unknown aerial phenomenon. Any definitive conclusions should be avoided due to the subjectivity of sighting reports. The negative will be retained for future reference.
