Dear Sir:
For some reason or another, you
get a letter of this kind, and it is perhaps the only explanation you 
will hear regarding the matter. I am sorry that I can not give you
more details, but I am just as puzzled about the whole matter as
you are. The only thing I can say is that on the night of August 
9, 1964, I observed a strange object in the sky which I could not identify
as any known type of aircraft. It was quite a distance away, and
I was unable to get a good look at it, but it appeared to be a bright
light, oblong in shape, hovering in the sky. I watched it for 
several minutes before it disappeared from sight. I immediately
reported the sighting to the proper authorities, but I have heard
nothing further about it. I hope this brief account is of some 
help to you in your investigation.

Sincerely yours,
[ILLEGIBLE]
