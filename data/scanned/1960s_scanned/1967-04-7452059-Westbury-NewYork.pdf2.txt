I was at work at the time, and I was wondering if I should report this. It is not the first time I have seen these objects, but I have never reported it before. I feel that they may be a threat, but I am not sure. I would like to know if others have seen them too, and what they think they are.

When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
