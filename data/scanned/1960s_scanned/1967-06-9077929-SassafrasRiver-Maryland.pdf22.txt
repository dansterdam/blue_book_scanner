A thing of should tell you have been seeing of late. It was something what can only be described as a very large black man-made machine, more of shape of a large hone with a cabin on it. We saw it very clearly for about fourteen to fifteen minutes as it moved to the east at a very fast rate of speed, so fast that it astonished both me and the two young men who were with me. It was moving so fast that it almost seemed to disappear in the distance as we watched it. We are all convinced that it was not of this earth-made, but must have been some kind of spacecraft from somewhere else. If it was something from this earth, no aircraft that I have seen or read of could move that fast. My brother has one seen it move with his own eyes, and we all agree as to what we saw. I hope this information will be of some help to you in your investigation.
