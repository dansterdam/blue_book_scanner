DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

November 25, 1968

Dear [REDACTED],

This replies to your letter dated November 23, 1968, in which you described seeing an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the inclosed questionnaire and return it in the attached envelope, our technical people at the Project Blue Book Office will be able to investigate.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the Nearest Air Force Base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator. He is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more complete and satisfactory explanation.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories or objects reported as UFO's in the material we are sending.

Sincerely,

/s/
JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
