9:15 p.m. - Witness, 30 year old male, was traveling west on I-75 in his automobile when he noticed an object about 300 yards away in the sky. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and shaped like a disc. The object had a red light on top and a green light on the bottom. The witness stated that the object made no noise and was hovering about 500 feet above the ground. The object remained stationary for about 30 seconds, then accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The witness did not hear any noise or see any flames or exhaust from the object. He estimated the speed of the object to be approximately 1000 mph. The witness immediately pulled his car off the road to investigate the sighting further, but the object had already disappeared. He did not observe any other vehicles or persons in the area at the time of the sighting. The witness stated that he could not offer any rational explanation for what he had observed.
