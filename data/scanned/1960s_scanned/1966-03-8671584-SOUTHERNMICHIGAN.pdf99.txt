'Mockery'
CLEVELAND, OHIO (UPI) -
One of 37 college coeds who reported seeing a mysterious aerial object near here says the Air Force report that the object was a "mockery."
Barbara Kohr, a Hillsdale College student who was in the group which made the sighting, accused the Air Force of trying to debunk their report Thursday. She said the Air Force report was "a mockery of the truth."
Miss Kohr, whose parents live in New Castle, Pa., and who was one of the group that observed the object through binoculars and telescopes, said the objects were "very precise."
