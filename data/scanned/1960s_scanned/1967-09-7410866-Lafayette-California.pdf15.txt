It was a very bright, all light ball of light traveling across the sky. It was very bright and was coming from overhead and crossing the sky at a rather fast speed. If you looked directly at it it would appeared solid and white yellowish but if you looked at the edge of it it was not as bright and looked to be somewhat transparent. The light was so bright one it would say its light was so bright, one of the brightest lights I've ever seen. It was actually brighter than the light of 3 stars. And the light actually did blind me for a second or two, but not seriously. The light and was not even close to being as dim as searchlights often seen up in the sky. It was definitely a light phenomenon and not aircraft since it moved in a very unorthodox and rapid motion across the sky which no plane or searchlight would do.
