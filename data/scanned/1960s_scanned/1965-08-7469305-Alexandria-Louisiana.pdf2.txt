This message was received by my family Dr. Bruce on the eve of my birthday. My brain received the message through telepathy - the information from England. My brain received the message as of 6-17-57. I recall no total for anything, but I do follow as directed. My message was recorded and I advised no one of this but my physician Dr. Bruce and the local investigator. I did contact a local official on the 6-17-57 date, but I'm not positive just who it was. The UFO appeared suddenly at a high altitude and remained in view for about 10 minutes. It was saucer shaped, silver in color, and it seemed to be guided by an invisible force. There seemed to be some type of energy field around it. I felt a strong tingling sensation when viewing it. The UFO made no sound, but the air seemed to vibrate. It then moved rapidly out of sight.
