Gentlemen:

On the night of August 12, 1962, about 9:30 P.M., my family and I saw an object which appeared to be about 200 to 300 miles above the surface of the earth. It was round in shape, and gave off a small blue-green light which seemed to disappear at approximately 9:37 P.M. E.D.T. The object was traveling in a south to north direction and left no trail behind it.

This is something like I have seen before, and if you could tell me anything about it, I would appreciate it. Also if this information is of any value to you, I would be glad to give you any additional details that I can recall.

Sincerely yours,

Danbury, Connecticut
