35. Information which you feel pertinent to a narrative explanation of the specific points of the questionnaire: I took the children out looking for the object when it was first sighted - it seemed to be a solid object and was sitting still in the sky, not moving, and had a glowing light on the top of it. When we first saw it, it was up high in the sky, then it came down closer and we could see it better. It seemed to be round in shape and was a bright light, not like a star or planet. It stayed in the same general area for awhile then just seemed to disappear. The children were quite excited about seeing it and were scared at first, but then got used to it and wanted to watch it. I have no idea what it was, but it didn't seem to be anything we are familiar with.
