FEB 29 1968

Dear [redacted],

This will reply to your letter of February 25, 1968, in which you described an unidentified flying object (UFO) that you and your friend observed.

With reference to your information of February 25, 1968, it will complete the attached questionnaire of the UFO you saw. However, we will still need to complete the attached questionnaire, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base so that each base has a UFO investigator who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify your sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
DAVID L. STILES
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
