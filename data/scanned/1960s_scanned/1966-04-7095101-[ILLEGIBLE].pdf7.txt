The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

"Proposed reply to letter from
Dear Mr. 
Reference your 10 April 1966 observation and photograph of an alleged unidentified flying object. Although the images appeared genuine (as opposed to photographic phenomena) it was not possible to determine the cause or nature of the object. It was interesting to note, however, that source information was approximately 300 feet from the object which was estimated to have a velocity of 800 mph. Although he stated that there was no sound, a sonic boom might well have been expected. Also noteworthy is the fact that although the background trees appear to show no significant degree of 'bending,' the object exhibits rather clear outlines rather than smearing or blurring as would be expected when a fast moving object is photographed. Although it is a matter for conjecture, a more likely cause for the imagery is a rather small man made object which was thrown into the air and photographed.
It appears that the photograph is not of the object observed by the witness as concluded from the above analysis. A positive identification of the object observed has not been made. There is no evidence to indicate that any extraterrestrial vehicle was observed."
