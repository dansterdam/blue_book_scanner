The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten letter from someone at the Hotel Camp Brosius in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin. The letter discusses the writer's experience of witnessing something unusual at 10:30 a.m. at the camp, and mentions that the "flying object" was "sighted" and "sincere". The writer seems to be providing an account or report of this observation.

Text transcribed from the letter:

Dear Sir:

We are on our vacation at
Camp Brosius, Elkhart Lake, 
Wisconsin. Last night Aug. 26
at 10:30 a.m. we spotted a most
flying object which was sincere
in shape. We first saw it in
the north west flying towards
the north. We thought it was a
morning southward of several
aircraft. We would like to have
your comments.
