The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book, with a form for gathering information about a UFO sighting. The form includes questions such as "Date you completed this questionnaire" and "Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting."

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
    Day _ Month _ Year _

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
