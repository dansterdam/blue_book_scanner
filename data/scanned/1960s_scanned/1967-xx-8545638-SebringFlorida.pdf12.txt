The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten letter. The letter appears to be addressed to "Dear Major" and the writer states that they will "send me more information on UFO's".

Transcribing the text in the image:

Dear Major,
Will you please send me more
information on UFO's.

Yours truly,
