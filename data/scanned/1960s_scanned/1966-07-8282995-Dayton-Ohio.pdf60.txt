The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book, with questions and blank spaces for the witness to fill out their observations.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle one:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle one:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound: Quiet, b. Color: White, Brilliant (very bright).
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object could have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
