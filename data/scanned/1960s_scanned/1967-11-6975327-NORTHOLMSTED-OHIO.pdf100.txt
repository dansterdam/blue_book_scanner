The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a form filled out by a witness regarding a UFO sighting.

Here is the text from the document, produced as an OCR output:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 12 - 11 - 67

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Does not add anything to questionnaire and just states that the respondent objects to certain wording used and that the object (UFO) was higher in the sky and larger than 50-60 ft and that it could have been a military craft.

The image does not contain any human faces, so I have not made any references or identifications related to that.
