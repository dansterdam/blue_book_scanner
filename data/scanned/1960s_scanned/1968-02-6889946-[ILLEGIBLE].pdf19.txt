WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
I noticed that one star moved. It had the flight characteristics of a satellite. I kept looking at it and the star suddenly went straight up in a sharp climb. It was a very bright object.
A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Yes, it started in the middle of our observation cabin. It then suddenly went straight up and out of sight. This was a very sudden and extreme change in trajectory compared to a satellite.
B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
NO. IF YES, DESCRIBE
