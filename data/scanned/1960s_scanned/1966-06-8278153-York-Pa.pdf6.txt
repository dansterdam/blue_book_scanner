Family Sights 'Saucer'
A York, Pa., family reported sighting a flying object in the sky shortly before 7 a.m. this morning within 700 yards of their home. Zion's View, described the object as a grayish-white oval-shaped saucer that hovered over the trees to the west of their home and appeared to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. Other members of the family witnessed the object as it moved with a rocking motion and at times appeared to turn on its side. No sound was heard. The state highway department says a survey crew assisting in construction work on a new elementary school in York county was working in the area at the time but had seen no unusual activity, although the men were not asked to make a statement. The Observer is 10 miles west of Wrightsville on the Lincoln Highway.
