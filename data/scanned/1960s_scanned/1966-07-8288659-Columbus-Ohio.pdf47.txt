The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram, but no actual photograph. The sketch shows a compass with directions, and instructions for the observer to draw a picture of the object's motion and path. There are also instructions to indicate the direction of travel if there were multiple objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that at the point shown, the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, or a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
