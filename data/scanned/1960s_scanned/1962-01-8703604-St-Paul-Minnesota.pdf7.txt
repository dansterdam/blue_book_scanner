Dear Sir,

After studying these newspaper accounts and having a number of conversations in regard to the U F O seen over the area on January 30, I am writing to provide you the report of my findings.

1) I would like to interview the witnesses of the incident s personally and obtain their signed statements. This would enable me to make a more complete and accurate report to you.

2) The people "who witnessed this incident refuse to give me their identities. They feel that, by doing so, their privacy and present occupations might be jeopardized. I would like to encourage them to come forward, but I must respect their wishes.

3) Mr. Becker's report was based on information received from a reliable source, i.e., the report by my wife to me.

Sincerely,
