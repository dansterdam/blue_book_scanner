Thousands In Tizzy
Over Objects In Sky

BUNKIE, La. (AP) - Residents of this town of 3,100 population were thrown into a tizzy Wednesday night when an object estimated to be about a mile and a half wide was reported to be hovering over the town. 

The object was first spotted by several witnesses about 10 p.m. and it remained visible for about an hour and a half.

Police and sheriff's deputies received numerous telephone calls from excited citizens reporting the object. Some described it as a "bright star" while others said it appeared to be on fire.

Members of the Avoyelles parish civil defense organization and Bunkie firemen were alerted and dispatched to investigate but the object disappeared before they arrived on the scene.

The Air Force carefully keeps records of such sightings and an officer at the air force base in Alexandria said the report would be duly noted and a file opened on the incident.

The officer added that visual sightings of unidentified flying objects were quite common in this area and the Air Force was confident that the Bunkie appearance would prove to be nothing out of the ordinary.
