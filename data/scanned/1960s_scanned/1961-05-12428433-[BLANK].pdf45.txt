The image contains a photograph of an inflatable structure, labeled "GENERAL ARRANGEMENT". The text describes this structure as part of the "packaged space station" and the "entry vehicle" and mentions that it is designed to hold the internal construction that would be the pressure-sealing member of the structure.

Inflatable Structures in Space

Our studies of inflatable structures known that the payload of the packaged space station and the re-entry vehicle are well within the limits of the payload capacity and the total weight are comparible with the booster capability. For that reason, we have no criticism on the booster to put such a special configuration. 

Perhaps I can describe this better by going actually to the model. Here we have the model that you saw in the movie. (See figure 14.) You can see that the mission module and Mercury capsule would be launched in this configuration. I think it is a rather recent development that we have gone to in order to solve the problem. We have here a paper model which shows this although simple, in fairly vivid terms, the type of arrangement that we can go with in a inflatable usage. 

The material usage that we fillment under the internal construction without any real concern for the cooling problem. We have here a paper model which shows this, although simple, in fairly vivid terms, the type of arrangement that we can go with in an inflatable usage.

The material usage that we fillment under the internal construction is a photograph of the inflatable structure that is required for the design pressure. Figure 15 is a photograph of the bladder internal construction, which would be then the pressure-sealing member of the structure.
