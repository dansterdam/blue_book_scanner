The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with a series of questions for the observer to fill out.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you find paralleled this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the object or objects which, when related to in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The observer has provided brief handwritten responses to the questions, which have been transcribed by the OCR system.
