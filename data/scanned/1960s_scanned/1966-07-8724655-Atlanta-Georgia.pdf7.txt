There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, containing only text.

K. My title is Chief of the Flight Service Station at Fulton County Airport, Atlanta, Georgia. I have spent the entire night in preparing this report, including firewatching operations. The information contained herein is the result of my close observation as described. There are no lance photographs, nor do I feel at this point that I have enough information to offer much assistance to the investigation of the observed incident. I have said to myself several times during the investigation that some of the lighting effects may have been caused by the dense atmosphere prevailing at the time. It further occurs to me that the objects, which have excited so much interest, may have been normal military aircraft which were operating under special conditions. On the surface it would seem that some unusual activity was in progress and that the objects were capable of speeds beyond those commonly known to us modern aircraft. They started to illuminate a brilliant violet-red light, then suddenly move off at a very rapid rate. I got one glimpse of the objects through my binoculars on an automobile top, and then suddenly move off at a very rapid rate. I do not feel that I can do anymore reporting than that at this time.

L. Evidence of physical existence, such as Photographs, etc.: One of the employees of the lance photographers, which was quite elaborately equipped with telephoto lens and especially high speed camera equipment. I very hopeful that he has some of these become available to me. I will submit them forthwith, with any other evidence we may obtain in the meantime.
