Miss Turnure/SAF-OIC/TG326/Oct 10, 1967

Dear Mr. Turnure,

Thank you for your report of the unidentified flying object that you observed in November 1966. Investigations should be impersible to conduct at this time.

If you are fortunate enough to sight another unidentified flying object, please contact the nearest Air Force base immediately. It is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
Major, USAF
Acting Chief, Civil Branch
Community Interactions Division
