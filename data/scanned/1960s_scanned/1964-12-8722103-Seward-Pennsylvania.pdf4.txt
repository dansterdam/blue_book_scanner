Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Thank you for your recent letter describing possible satellite or meteorite observations. The objects which you have described are similar to either meteor or satellite decay reports.

Satellite observations from meteor observations by the direction of flight and duration of the sighting. A satellite would normally move at a constant speed and would disappear over the horizon. Meteors, on the other hand, are characterized by a rapid rise in brightness, a few seconds of maximum brightness, and then a rapid decay.

The Air Force appreciates your reported meteor sightings and is interested in observations of this type as the characteristics are very similar to those of satellite decay.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR
Major, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
