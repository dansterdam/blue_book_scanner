The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an unidentified object sighting that occurred on April 16, 1965 in Lewisburg, Ohio.

The text in the document reads as follows:

VHRO (USAF) 
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO 
15 April 1965

Dayton, Ohio 45433

On 16 April 1965 at approximately 9:30 p.m. EDT, an object was observed over the Lewisburg, Ohio area for a period of approximately one hour.

The object was described as round, glowing, and pulsating. It appeared to hover, then accelerate rapidly and disappear. It was observed by several persons.

It is the opinion of the observers, relative to sighting, that the object was not any conventional aircraft or astronomical object known to them.

We cannot determine the true identity of the object. If additional information is available which might assist in the investigation, please advise.

Sincerely,

RICHARD COTTERILL, GS-11
