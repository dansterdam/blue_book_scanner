The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document or report. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  __ 27 ___________ MAY ____1967_________
                                               Month          Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire are described as follows:

AT A QUESTION WAS ASKED THEY RECALLED THAT
PARACHUTE PIECES WERE FOUND AT THE LOCATION & 
THEY  WERE  NOT  PARACHUTES. @ THE LOWER
EDGE OF THE OBJECT IS WHAT LOOKS LIKE A SMALL
PARACHUTE LOOKS LIKE THIS (Drawing) WHILE 
UFOs LOOKED LIKE THIS:-
ALSO NOTE NO SHROUD LINES. THERE WAS A WIND, BUT THEY 
(THE UFOs) WERE PERFECTLY STEADY. @ THE 
UFOs FORMATION WAS PERFECT AND ONE WAS LEFT BEHIND 
ONE IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE DRIFTED ACROSS THE WIND. 
ALSO, TO DISAPPEAR THEY DRIFTED BEHIND CLOUDS ONCE, AT THISA 
POINT I CANNOT BE SURE THEY DID NOT SEE THEM AGAIN. THEY
DID NOT SEE THEM AGAIN AFTER THAT. THEY CAME HOVERING
AND THEN DRIFTED BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL POSITIONS. THE 
NEIGHBORS SAID IT WAS FENCE AND WE COULD NOT SEE 
THEM FROM THERE. HE COULD NOT SEE THEM AGAIN AFTER THEY
WERE BACK IN THEIR ORIGINAL POSITIONS. THEY DRIFTED BEHIND
THE TREES ONCE MORE AND DID NOT REAPPEAR.
