JOINT MESSAGEFORM - (C) INITIATION SHEET
SECURITY CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED
ATIG W-P AFB
WHEN THEY ARE IN REALITY ABOUT ONE-HALF DEGREE BELOW THE HORIZON - THE INCREASING DENSITY OF THE LOWER AIR CAUSES THE STAR ARCTURUS TO SEEM TO BE BELOW THE HORIZON ACCORDING TO THE WITNESSES AND WOULD APPEAR ON OR JUST BELOW THE HORIZON. THE MAGNITUDE OF ARCTURUS IS 0.2, ONLY FIVE STARS - BETELGEUSE, CANOPUS, SIRIUS, RIGEL KENTAURUS AND VEGA ARE BRIGHTER. THE MOTIONS ATTRIBUTED TO THE STAR ARE PROBABLY DUE TO ATMOSPHERIC MOTIONS RESULTING FROM INCONSISTENCIES IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND RELATIVE MOTION RESULTING FROM AIRCRAFT MOVEMENT. IT WOULD NOT BE UNUSUAL FOR EXPERIENCED OBSERVERS TO BE PUZZLED BY THIS PHENOMENA. SIMILAR EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN FOUND QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL ASTRONOMERS FOR A LIMITED TIME.
