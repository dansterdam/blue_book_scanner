Transcribing the text from the document:

He described the object as of an elongated shape, it was visible at about 500 feet and seemed to be revolving - it gave off a great deal of maneuverability, it made a sharp abrupt angle. The object appeared to be a bright silver, as compared as a bogger. Did not observe the object on RX or TX.
[Redacted] other called the flight tower at WPAFB and found to be a C-135 making a practice approach 12:55 PM at made six practice approaches 1:15 AM, 1:26 AM, 1:35 AM, 2:20 AM, and 2:32 AM. The duty stated that the C-135 was over the Enon area due to a normal training operation.
Nothing unusual moving on or in connection.
Since the observer stated he did not notice aircraft in area and since the C-135 was the only aircraft flying low over the area, it is my opinion that the object observed was C-135 making its practice approach.
