The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document page with text describing an observation of four objects 45 degrees above the horizon from Rapid City, South Dakota. The objects were observed over Ellsworth Air Force Base, two south of the base. They were described as red, white, and green in color, and were reported to be moving at a high speed of approximately 60 miles per hour. The text indicates that the objects were reported by multiple people in Rapid City and that they disappeared at 0752.

Four objects 45 degrees above horizon observed from Rapid City, S Dakota. One over Ellsworth Air Force Base, two south of the base, one west northwest over Rapid City. They were all red, white and green. Ellsworth reported one southward of base moving about 20 miles per hour. Appeared to be low altitude. This has been reported by several people in Rapid City. They just reported to me that it disappeared at 0752. That's all I have. No mounted photo. Pass it on to NICAP. Wright.
