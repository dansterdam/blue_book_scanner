Dear Sir,

You must get quite a lot of flying saucer reports every so often. Some are from people who are because of weather, heat, dust, etc. What ever the case you must get quite a lot. I have something that may interest you. Something different than a flying saucer story.

This evening I went to a drive-in movie at the Waterford Drive-in in Waterford, Connecticut to see a historical movie entitled Genghis Khan and its co-feature The Rain Must Fall which I saw before. It was about twenty five minutes of nine, the sky was clear and the moon was out. I happened to glance up at the moon because since I had seen The Rain Must Fall (which played first) before I wasn't very interested in it. I was alone in the car as I did not have a date for the evening.  I was looking at the moon when I noticed a very dark speck or object moving across the face of the moon, in a straight line. In fact the speck or object was traveling across the middle of the moon's surface. I continued to watch the moon for about ten minutes and I noticed that this object was orbiting the moon three times every two minutes I could tell this by watching my watch in the bright light from the car's dash board. Now the bright side of the moon reflecting the sun's rays is always towards us and to the naked human eye the moon appears to be stationary.
