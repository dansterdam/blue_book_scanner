Moody Mark 20a
And do you recall the number?
8393 Echo.
You said before your altitude was-- 6000.
Your heading was 180Â°?
Right.  
Your air speed at the time? 
140 indicated. Out about 160 or something like that.
And the aircraft's base was Utah Central? 
Right.
Do you have any idea as to the time?
It was right close to noon. Your Salt Lake radio could give you the time I am quite sure they monitored this thing. They called and said, "Are you talking to us, we've got something on the scope, we're watching this thing right." And they suggested I call Salt Lake Radio; I was talking to Utah Central. And they said they were watching the thing too, and were trying to determine whether I was talking to them or whether it was just, you know, something real and then came back on Unicom frequency and headed back toward the field. So they would have a report on the time.
At the time was there any cloud ceiling?
No cloud cover of any kind. The sky was completely blue.
