Sir:
I would like to report some very peculiar aerial behavior which I observed on July 29, 1965.
At approximately 11:45 p.m. Central Daylight Time, my wife and I were outdoors observing the stars, as usual. We noticed a very bright object flying from north to south over Chicago. The observing conditions were excellent and the object stood out clearly against the sky.
At first I thought it might be a very high flying aircraft, but the speed and absence of the usual aircraft running lights indicated otherwise. We watched it for about 4 or 5 minutes as it slowly made its way to the south. Then, suddenly, it stopped dead in its tracks and hovered for a few seconds. Next, it began to oscillate back and forth, then dart rapidly in various directions, sometimes disappearing and reappearing. It seemed to be under intelligent control. The maneuvers were unnatural for any known aircraft. Finally, it accelerated at a fantastic rate of speed and disappeared from sight to the south.
These were the observations: a bright, motionless object travelling from north to south, then sudden stops, oscillation, rapid changes of direction, very fast acceleration and disappearance. The luminosity of the object was exceptionally bright, without blinking or flashing lights.
As you can imagine, this was a most unusual sighting and we could offer no explanation as to the nature of the object. I would appreciate any information you can provide as to what it might have been. Thank you.

Sincerely,
