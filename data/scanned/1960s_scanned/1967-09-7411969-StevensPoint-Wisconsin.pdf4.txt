Sir:
Enclosed you will find samples of what appears to be bits of aluminum. It was found in a neighbor's field. This neighbor says that he thinks it fell from the sky. Why he thinks this, I don't know.
There was just one small clump of it on the material in the field. What you hold now is just a sample. Perhaps it is just some ordinary substance, and then maybe it comes from some strange place. Anyway, I'm sending it to you to examine closely.
I would appreciate it if you could tell me what the substance is. Also, could you please send me as much information as possible, concerning it.
If you are unable to tell me what the substance is, it's OK. The important thing is that you have the substance to examine.
I would appreciate any information you can offer.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
Thomas Maslowski
