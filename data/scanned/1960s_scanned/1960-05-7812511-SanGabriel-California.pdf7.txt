Dear Capitalistic Friends,

While waiting to go to church (Now 9.40AM Sunday morning Standard Mountain Time) I read "The Family Fallout Shelter" SP-115. My fellow chemists and others professional bourgeoisie "poh pushed" my efforts to prepare for and defend ourselves for an all out Atomic War, ever since Hiroshima.  

The Powers case is your "baby".

On May 12 at 8.40 PM Standard Mountain Time I was sitting on the north ledge of the East entrance of the main building at Mark Keppel High School in the Alhambra School District of California. From what I told on military observation of plane movements I estimate I saw a flying saucer traveling toward me and somewhat east. If interested I can take one of your military men and show the approximate movement between a tree and a light pole about a block away. As I first saw it in my binoculars I thought it might be a light reflection. But I took another look and it looked like a morning star (reddish like mars) except it had somewhat of a crossextension something like a spine on a eschinodermat. I waited for it to pass by in my line of vision past the cross arm of the light pole. It disappeared. A star was visible in that same area that remained about the same, but no visible movement.

I have told now one about it. I was alone and I don't usually take a breather on the East side of the Night School only on the North. And I'm not making my carbon copy.

Yours for Truth.
San Gabriel, Ca
