The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The text on the image states "UFO" at the top, followed by some handwritten notes that describe an unidentified aerial object. The notes state that the object was "looked like a parachute in sky related" and was observed in Dayton, Ohio.
