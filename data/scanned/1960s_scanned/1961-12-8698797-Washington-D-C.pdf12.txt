Washington 25, D. C.

Dear [redacted],

Things were so rushed last Tuesday in Washington that I am sure I didn't get a chance to call you or to tell you how much I appreciated your kindness in arranging the meeting with the Director of the Diamond Case. We had a very interesting discussion.

I talked some more with the principals in the "Diamond Case" but got little else that was new. From a rough check, it seems that this crystallization reached the stage it did largely because of the way it was handled all around. No navigation light was seen, a helicopter was ruled out since the object was obviously low and yet showed no signs of vertical motion. He was of the opinion that it was too low for the density altitude of the city and the altitude generally obtaining there. This makes the case interesting, perhaps, but hardly conclusive from our point of view, other than that which is directly in their pattern. He is a little weight, although I am in no position to judge this.

I certainly hope that you and Colonel Russel W. Evarstrom can come visit us this year in Evanston, Illinois. In the meantime, Very best Greetings for the New Year.

Cordially,

J. Allen Hynek
Director

CO: Major Robert J. Friend
