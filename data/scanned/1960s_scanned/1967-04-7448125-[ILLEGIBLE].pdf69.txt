The writer relates that the witness checked the local mountain area from residence window to see if the sight could be seen again. The here-in described light could be seen near the ridge horizon to the west of his residence. While outside, the writer observed the light appear to change color from red to orange and yellow. Binoculars were obtained. The "light" was above the ridge with occasional blinking. Stars around it were visible all during the sighting, and they did not twinkle like the "light". The sighting lasted for about 55 min. The light did not change color, but appeared to yellow-white with a definite red hue. It grew dimmer as if moving farther away. The "light" was steady for about 5 min, then it seemed to dim, then reappear as bright as before. After about 55 min it disappeared. 5 min later it re-appeared, the same elevation as before but traveling west. It disappeared again behind the ridge. The writer continues that at no time did the light seem to alter its course or change direction. It simply disappeared and reappeared. The writer immediately called the authorities and more people came to observe the light. For about 1 hour it would disappear behind the ridge and reappear, until it finally disappeared permanently.
