There is no photograph present in this scanned document from the Project Blue Book files. The image shows an official letter dated February 13, 1954, addressed to a Colonel and written by Major Maston M. Jacks of the Office of Information, United States Air Force.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Colonel:

Reference telephone conversation of February 10th, the Air Force has been unable to make any evaluation of the object viewed on February 20th.

Since the object viewed was apparently over the National Airport during a period of heavy air traffic and no reports were made from aircraft or tower personnel, it is believed that you observed some natural phenomena. However, there is no evidence to support any conclusion as to the cause of this observed condition.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information

Washington 25, D.C.
