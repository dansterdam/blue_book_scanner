Dear Dr. Hynek,
There are three plants in the Boston area operated by AVCO, one in Waltham(administration), Everett, and Wilmington. There is also a AVCO-RAD research and development plant in Wilmington. She doesn't know beyond that what department he is in, but she knows he works on rocket design. They live in Newton, Mass. Wilmington is apparently just off Rte. 128. If any more information is needed, contact me.

Signed,
[redacted]

P.S. I'm going to need more bullets soon. Say hi to [redacted].
