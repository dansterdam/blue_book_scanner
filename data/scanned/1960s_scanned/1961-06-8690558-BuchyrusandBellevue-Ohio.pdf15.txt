The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a scanned page from a document that seems to have handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract the text from the image:

The alleged unidentified flying object was observed by Mr. and Mrs. Claude Greer, residents of Bucyrus, Ohio, on June 8, 1961. According to their report, the object was first noticed at 9:30 p.m. in the southern sky and was observed for approximately 45 minutes. The object was described as a round, lighted object that moved slowly across the sky. No sound was heard. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of about 2,000 feet. The witnesses stated that the object appeared to be metallic in construction and emitted a dim, reddish-orange glow. After about 45 minutes, the object disappeared from view, apparently behind some trees.
