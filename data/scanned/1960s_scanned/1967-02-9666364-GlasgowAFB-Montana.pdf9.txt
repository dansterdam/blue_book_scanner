The image contains a sketch or diagram related to a report on an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch shows a compass rose, as well as instructions for the observer to mark the location of the object and its direction of travel. There is also a question asking how many objects were observed, with the observer providing a handwritten response.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object. 

28. Draw a sketch that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, THEN HOW MANY WERE THERE? 2
Draw a picture of how they were arranged and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
