Dear Sir:

In May of this year I contacted your outfit regarding the sighting of several U F O's. Twenty-five feet of 8mm color films were taken of the sighting and as your instructions I forwarded the film to you. I was told by you that after examining the pictures you would return them to me with the results of your investigation. As of this date I have not received the film or any information regarding the matter.

I am needless to say very much interested in finding out exactly what it was that I photographed and am also very much interested in having my films returned. I would very much like to hear from you about the above mentioned matter. If it is at all possible I should also like to receive some enlargements of the pictures. Thanking you in advance for a speedy reply I remain

Truly yours,
