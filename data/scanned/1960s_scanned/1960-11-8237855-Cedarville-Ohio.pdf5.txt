The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, potentially from Project Blue Book, with a series of questions for the observer to answer.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How long did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a watch stick or man's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the width of the hand. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the watch hand?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
