SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: FTD (TDETR)

1. In accordance with AFR 80-17 the attached report is forwarded.

2. Due to the proximity of several airfields in the area of this sighting (including Fayetteville Municipal Airfield, Simmons Army Air Field, and Pope AFB) I believe the UFO reported can be attributed to various aircraft or helicopter lights.
