Transcribing the text from the document:

5. This matter was discussed with Major Earl J. Wolf Jr., FTD Liaison Officer, Hq PACAF. He suggested that since a condition of certain and/or weather temperature conditions, the sound was a reverberation of noises from police sirens going to the nearby accident. Since the visual observations reported to the military and civil authorities were vague - this suggestion would appear to be the most valid to date.
