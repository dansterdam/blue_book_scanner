APGIR-52
UFO Sighting, 2 May 61, Cincinnati, Ohio

Dear Sir:
The report of your sighting of an unidentified flying object in the 
vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, on 2 May 1961 has been received. 
This case has been assigned the case number 6639118, and the
information you provided has been made a matter of record.

There are certain factors which tend to make this type of sighting
somewhat difficult to evaluate. The phenomenon seen was of very
short duration, possibly only a few seconds, and this, coupled with
lack of corroborative evidence from other sources, makes the precise
identification of this object difficult, if not impossible.

However, a thorough analysis has been made of the details submitted,
and it is believed that this sighting does not constitute evidence of an
extraterrestrial visitation. The description indicates characteristics more
consistent with a natural phenomenon, such as a meteor or other astronomical
object, rather than with the maneuverable and intelligently-controlled devices
often associated with "unidentified flying objects."

Thank you for your interest in this matter.
Sincerely,
PHILIP G. STRONG
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Science and Components
