The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a surveyor landing gear or shock absorber, based on the description provided in the text. The text describes the technical specifications and design parameters of this component, which is called the "Surveyor Landing Gear" and is produced by the Pneumodynamics Corp. National Water Lift Division.

SURVEYOR LANDING GEAR
Project Surveyor is a scientific task with the end requirement of successfully accomplishing a landing on the moon. The design parameters are very severe. Temperatures range from 275°F to -260°F, and pressures inside the unit are 2,500 psi, and pressures outside the unit drop to 10-12 torr.
The unit contains a gas charge at 1500 psi and will retain such a charge for 12 months. External moving parts are encapsulated by flexible metal bellows. The unit uses a special grade of titanium (13 Cr 11V 3 Al) heat treated to 185,000 psi minimum, very detailed and compressive reliability program controls.
By the nature of its' end usage, the production of the shock absorber will be small. However, the engineering, product know-how, and special experience requirements are very large. This unit typifies NWL Company's capacity for small production runs on sophisticated hardware.
