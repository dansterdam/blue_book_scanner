NO UFO'S OVER VIRGINIA - MARYLAND?

The Air Force is investigating the reported sighting of two unidentified flying objects over Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Maryland.

The radar operators observed two objects on their scope rapidly closing in on the station at a speed of 2,700 m.p.h. for 10 to 20 minutes. (From the report, 15 Dec 1964)

The visual sighting was made approximately 2 minutes after the radar contact at 5:35 p.m. est. on 8 December 1964. The objects were described as glowing and metallic in appearance.

The Navy passed on the report to the A.F. at Wright-Patterson A.F.B. (From a teletype message, 14 Dec 1964)

The objects were described as "similar to the configuration of a C-141 aircraft". The AF said: A study of the shapes and the descriptions indicated that the objects "were probably F-106 jet interceptors from the local area". (From a letter, 17 Dec 1964)

It was stated that "Palms radar returns may have been insect or cloud interference, as we don't get any similar blips," it said.

National Capital Region, 17:27-:28 Richmond, Virginia:
"Nobody saw a similar blip," the AF said. For the time period and the location there, the report was questioned. US was? Why did they release this report without checking this?
