There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Text from the document:

DID THE PHENOMENON
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDEN SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE SHAPE OR SIZE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
11. WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

THE LIGHT

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

DROPPED OVER THE TERRAIN

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

IN THE DISTANCE IT FINALLY 
DROPPED OVER THE HORIZON
