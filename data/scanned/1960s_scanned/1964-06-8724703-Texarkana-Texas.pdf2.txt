DEAR DR. HYNEK:

I HAVE BEEN MEANING TO WRITE YOU FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO THAT I COULD SEND YOU SOME PROGRESS REPORTS ON OUR "UNION" PROJECT. IF YOU RECALL, MY FAMILY HAD AN ENJOYABLE VACATION NORTH OF THE BORDER, AND SOON AFTER OUR RETURN WE EQUIPED OUR UNION WITH EQUIPMONT HAS BEEN OPERATING 16-INCH REFLECTOR FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS. THE TELESCOPE NEEDS SOME MINOR ATTENTION, AND WE SHOULD HAVE IT BACK IN OPERATION SHORTLY.

AT THE PRESENT, WE ARE USING A MODIFICATION (8-16C) PHOTO ADAPTER WHICH WAS DEVELOPED FOR US BY THE CANADIAN ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC PURPOSES. IN THIS CONNECTION, WE HAVE ALSO BEEN WORKING ON THE 1132 LUNAR CALIBER.

IF THE FIELD TRIALS ARE SUCCESSFUL, WE HOPE TO FIELD-TEST THE SYSTEM SHORTLY. OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT HAVE NOT BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL AS WE HAD HOPED, BUT WE STILL ARE CONTINUING OUR EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION.

AT THE PRESENT TIME, DISCUSSIONS ARE BEING HELD AT GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER AND THE BECAM INTERESTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE TRACKING SYSTEM. THEY BECAME INTERESTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE TRACKING SYSTEM. TAKING WITH THE PROJECT DIRECTOR AND THE BECAM INTERESTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE TRACKING SYSTEM. THE BECAM'S CURRENT THINKING IS THAT THEIR SERVICE AT GODDARD WILL BE REQUIRED FOR SOME OF THEIR OBSERVATIONS OF PHENOMENA.

WE ARE WITH YOUR TIME DISCUSSING THE U.F.O. PROBLEM WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA AND, WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT FACTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED. IN THIS CONNECTION, I SHALL BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

SINCERELY,
(SIGNATURE)
