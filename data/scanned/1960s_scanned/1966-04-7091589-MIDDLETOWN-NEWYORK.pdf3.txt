The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a handwritten document that appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"This particular object was observed for 8-10 minutes. It was quite large, estimated to be between 40-50 feet in diameter. It appeared to be a greenish color and seemed to have a row of lights around the perimeter. The object moved about in a jerky, erratic manner, not like any conventional aircraft. It made no sound that could be heard. The object was observed by 3 adult witnesses, whose reliability is considered very good. Their observations indicate a serious object that cannot be readily explained. Mrs. [redacted] in phone message."
