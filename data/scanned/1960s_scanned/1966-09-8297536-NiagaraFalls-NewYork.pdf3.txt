Rice, 29, apparently noticed an object which seemed brighter and larger than stars in the sky. What it was I could not have said, as it did not remain long enough for me to make a careful observation of it. It seemed to be moving along a course at a speed no greater than a slow moving car. When I reached home the object had disappeared.

Sept. 26th
Mr. Charles Cutts, of Buffalo, reports he sighted one bright object which moved past in the sky, from west to east, for several seconds. Called wife and children to view it. The object seemed quite distant, and of a definite circular shape, reflected a light like moonlight. Duration of observation, probably a minute and a half.

The house at 7:35 PM to make a purchase of gasoline. Cutts and Mrs. Cutts were in the driveway. Mrs. Cutts saw an object, apparently at an altitude of about 45 degrees in a north-easterly direction. She said it was circular, moving straight and level, reflecting light like that of a match flame on a dark night. It was observed for about 20 seconds, and then disappeared through the haze. Mrs. Cutts called Cutts' attention to the object, but he did not see it until it had almost gone out of sight. It appeared to be at a considerable distance.

Capt. Morgan and Miss Johnston were visiting with me for a while. Discussed UFO's a little, but there was no other observation made at that time.
