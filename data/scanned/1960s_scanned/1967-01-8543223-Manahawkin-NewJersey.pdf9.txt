The image does not contain any photograph, it appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: May 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

After it had disappeared for quite a while, the object finally reappeared. The EST Harrison Ranger, he claims, were watching certain of the object when we first saw it hanging in the sky. The object was extremely bright, brighter than any normal star, but bigger and brighter than any plane. It made no noise and disappeared into the clouds across the sky at an incredible speed and disappeared into the dark bank in the E.S.E. horizon over the ocean.

We knew the object was not a plane, we see many planes at night since we are located near Maguire Air Force Base, Pomona Field, and I.A.F.B.

We are certain the object was not a meteor or meteorite, of which we have seen quite a few.

As I have said before, we are convinced in learning more about the object we saw. The sudden movement and speed of the object were fantastic.
