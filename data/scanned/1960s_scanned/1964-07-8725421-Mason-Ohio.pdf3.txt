Transcribed text from the document:

"There was no air craft. It was quiet, no noise. There were no lights other than the illumination of the object itself. I gave the object close observation and watched it move away slowly and disappear. This was seen about 8:30 PM July 1964. The object appeared to be about 20 to 30 feet in diameter and about 10 to 15 feet thick. It did not appear to be a conventional aircraft of any kind. I believe this object to be a UFO. I am an engineer by profession and have observed many aircraft in my lifetime but this was unlike any I have ever seen before."
