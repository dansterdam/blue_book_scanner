The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a scanned page from a document related to a UFO sighting. I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

It was all lit up. There were lights all around it, and in a few minutes it disappeared. 

Hynek: Did you ever see anything like it before?
No, never did.

Hynek: If you held your hand out in front of you, how much of the object would it have covered up?
Oh, well, not very much.

Hynek: Well, it was really very big then?
Pretty big.

Hynek: Did it ever pass in front of anything or in back of anything?
Well, let's see, it came over the barn but I don't believe it passed in front of anything or in back of anything. 

Hynek: How high would you have to raise your arm to point directly at it when it was at its highest?
Not too high.

Hynek: So it was fairly close to the horizon then?
Pretty close.

Hynek: Did it have sharp edges or did it have fuzzy edges?
Quite sharp.

Hynek: What was the color of the light?
Just white lights.

Hynek: Did it ever change color?
No, not at all.

Hynek: Now, if you had a tractor light, or an automobile headlight in front of you, how far would you have to be from the light to have the same brightness? About a block, or something like that?
About a block or two blocks maybe. It wasn't too big.

Hynek: About the same size, I'd say. The whole object you mean?
Yes, the whole object. What impressed you most about it, what was the thing that struck you the most?
The brightness of it.

Hynek: What did you think it was?
I didn't know what it was. It scared me at first.

Hynek: Do you think it could have been a balloon, or something like that?
