Fantasy at Falling
The following is a copy of a report from a witness in Falling, England:

In a small but well-kept garden of a cottage in a remote part of Falling, England, a young couple reported seeing a strange, luminous object in the sky on the evening of June 1, 1964.

The object, they stated, appeared to be semi-circular in shape, glowing with a soft, silvery light. It hovered silently in the air, moving slowly in a fashion described as "almost floating".

After a few minutes, the object began to descend towards the ground, finally coming to rest on the grass within the cottage garden. Two human-shaped beings emerged from the object, the witness reported. They were described as being about five feet tall, with disproportionately large, round heads and thin, arm-like limbs.

The beings moved slowly about the garden, apparently inspecting the surroundings. After a short time, they reentered the object, which then began to rise vertically and rapidly disappear from sight.

There were no other witnesses to this event - the couple, who wished to remain anonymous, were the only people who observed the strange occurrence. They stated that they were at first terrified, but later realized the experience was something out of the ordinary, and decided to report it.

The area where most of the residents live is quite remote, and there are no major roads or other facilities nearby. This adds to the puzzling nature of the incident.

One person who has seen the object stated that there was a short, brilliant flash in the sky just before the object appeared. Others have reported seeing a bright glow on the horizon at about the same time.

"Keith", another witness, refused to believe the event took place, stating that he did not think it possible. But the couple, who wished to remain anonymous, insisted that what they saw was terrifying. 

"And the little green men?" asked the interviewer. "That's just fantasy," replied the witness.

Local authorities report that no landing marks or other physical evidence has been found in the garden. Aside from the reports from the couple, there is no other information to confirm the incident.

Our investigators have found that many such "sightings" can be explained by natural phenomena. However, in this case, the details seem to go beyond the usual pattern of "flying saucers" or "little green men". There appears to be an element of fantasy involved, yet the witnesses seem sincere and convinced that what they saw was real. It is a curious case that defies easy explanation.
