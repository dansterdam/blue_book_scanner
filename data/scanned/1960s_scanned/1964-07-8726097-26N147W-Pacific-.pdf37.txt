Transcription of the text in the document:

At 1110 time, 8 July 1964, several observers at this location observed what appeared to be an unidentified flying object. The object was first sighted in the western sky, approximately 10 degrees above the horizon. The object appeared to be a bright light, larger than a star, and was moving in an erratic manner. The object changed direction several times and appeared to change in intensity. After approximately 5 minutes of observation, the object disappeared from view, apparently being obscured by clouds. No sound was heard and no other details could be observed. The observers were unable to determine the size, distance, or altitude of the object. Weather conditions were clear with unlimited visibility at the time of the observation.
