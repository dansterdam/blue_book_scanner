Dear Sir:

This is your letter of May 23rd addressed to the President of the United States has been referred to me for reply. The information which you have presented has been carefully considered for the investigation.

The date of your sighting along with the time and description of the object observed as a brilliant object similar in appearance to a disc (?EESC) launched from a coastal Virginia launching site into an extremely high altitude, will, I assure you, be made a matter of record.

A comparison of your information with that obtained from other sources indicates that the object you observed was probably a small satellite or space vehicle launched on or about that date, and your description and sighting time are consistent with the known performance capabilities of small satellites at that time. I realize that this may be disappointing to you since many persons are hoping for definite evidence of extraterrestrial activity, but the objective analysis indicates this object was of terrestrial origin. 

I hope this information is useful to you. Please let me know if you have any further questions about this matter.
