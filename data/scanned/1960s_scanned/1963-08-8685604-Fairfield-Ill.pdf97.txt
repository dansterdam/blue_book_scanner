OUTPUT TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

"When I got back, Miles said, "There's something going on out there that we don't understand." He said he had seen a strange light in the sky with a pinkish-blue color that seemed to be moving rapidly. He said it would disappear for a while and then reappear in a different spot in the sky. 

He said his father and grandfather had also seen it. Then it disappeared. As to what it was, I do not know. We have not seen it since. 

Mrs. Shore said, "When I got home, my husband said that he had seen a strange light in the sky about 9 p.m. Monday. He said the light was round and would dart up, down, or sideways, very rapidly, and then come to a sudden stop, and then dart off again."

Mr. Shore went inside to call the police, but when he came out, the light had disappeared. He said he does not know what the object might have been.

Others saw it 
Mr. Moxley, who lives north, said that a friend of his, who lives nearby, reported seeing a strange object in the sky about the same time as the Shores did. This friend said the object was a large, circular, brilliant light with four flashing lights like portholes on the side. He said it moved rapidly and then went straight down into the sea, a round ball with more pronounced sticking out.

Mrs. Shore went inside her home to call the police, but when her husband came back outside, the light had disappeared. She said she does not know what the object might have been."
