k. This particular report was called in to the O'Hare Base Operations Office. The young lady seemed cooperative. She felt that someone might need to know about the object she was sighting. She was allegedly writing a letter to the Air Force about the information described in AFR 200-2. It is this officer's opinion that the sighting was either a helicopter or aircraft. Approximately where the North Avenue beach is located is also point where several aircraft were observed. The item system 27 at O'Hare would run this type of lights well out over the lake to distinguish their aircraft because of the heavy traffic. It appears to combine the bright landing lights with a revolving motion beacon to explain the touch or red. The landing lights from a distance appear to twinkle because of their candle power and distance. This is original or report written by the observer.
