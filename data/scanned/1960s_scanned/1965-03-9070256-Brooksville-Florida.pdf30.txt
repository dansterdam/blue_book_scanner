MEMO FOR THE RECORD
12 MARCH 1965
SUBJ: INVESTIGATION OF REPORTED UFO LANDING SITE
TO: AFIT (LT J.S. ALEXANDER)
1. PER YOUR ARRANGEMENT, I MET LT GOODRIE, MACDILL AFB, AT THE WWJB RADIO STATION IN BROOKSVILLE AT APPROXIMATELY 1130, SATURDAY, 6 MARCH 1965.
2. A VEHICLE ACCOMPANIED BY ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL, AN AIR FORCE SERGEANT. WE DROVE TO THE REPORTED LANDING SITE ABOUT FOUR MILES WEST-NORTHWEST OF BROOKSVILLE, FL.
3. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE AREA HAD RECEIVED RAIN AND AN INSECTICIDE POWDER, POSSIBLY INDICATING RECENT TRAFFIC. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A LANDING SITE AS SUPPOSEDLY REPRESENTED THE IMPRINT OF THE LANDING LEGS, AS INDICATED BY THE INDIVIDUAL IN RADIO STATION. THIS REPORT WAS, THEREFORE, FOUND TO BE INACCURATE, HAVING BEEN OBLITERATED, THUS, NO OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE OF THEIR EXISTENCE REMAINED.
4. THE AREA WAS EXAMINED CLOSELY, THE SPACING AND COMPASS ORIENTATION OF THE HOLES WERE MEASURED WITHIN A RECTANGULAR AREA AND SURROUNDING AREA.
5. SOME OPINION WAS SOLICITED OR WILL BE OFFERED AS TO THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE SIGHTING OR THE RELIABILITY OF THE OBSERVER, HOWEVER, I DID NOT MAKE ANY SUCH CONCLUSION SINCE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE WAS NOT AVAILABLE AND NOT DELVE INTO CONJECTURE. 
THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS MY OBSERVATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS:
A. SOIL SAMPLE IN THE SIGHTING AREA IS THE TYPICAL, FINE SANDY LOAM FOUND IN THIS AREA OF FLORIDA. THE SURFACE OF THIS SOIL WAS COVERED WITH LIGHT RESIDUE OF DECAYING FIELD GRASS AND THE DECOMPOSED PLANT MATERIAL.
