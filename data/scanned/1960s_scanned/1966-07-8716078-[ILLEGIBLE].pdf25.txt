Dear Sir:

On the night of July 26, 1966 a strange, unexplained event happened to me. It was observed between Goldsboro and Rougemont, N.C. & encountered a large glare resembling a light intensified as for a vehicle, Alt.[?] glare coming from a wooded area appeared to stop and reappear about 100 yards away. As I was coming from a wooded area, it stopped my car for a while & I stopped and got out to try to determine what could be causing this phenomenon.

As I shined my car light toward the glare, whatever it was, it seemed to move away and disappear in the distance. I can't be sure whether it was a one-time occurrence or whether it will recur. I felt that this was a strange and unusual event, and I would appreciate any information or suggestions you may care to give me concerning my experience.

Yours truly,
[Signature]
