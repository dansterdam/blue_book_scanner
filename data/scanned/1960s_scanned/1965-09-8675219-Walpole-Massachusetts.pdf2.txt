Dear sir,
On the evening of September 4, 1965 around 10:30 P.M. I saw what appeared to be two similar objects in the sky near Carver. They were luminous and moved slowly across the sky at a constant velocity. Their shape was oval and they seemed to be joined (from side to side) at a central point. The objects followed a circular path and were visible for about 20-25 minutes.
On the evening of September 9, 1965 I saw a triangular-shaped object in the sky. It was brilliantly lighted and moved silently across the sky. Its speed was quite rapid compared to the objects seen earlier and it was the most beautiful blue-green I have ever seen. (Cavers Walpole, Mass.)
My investigation is currently incomplete as I would like your please explain some technical aspects of these sightings.
Sincerely,
