There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document states:

"W/R: On 25 Mar 65 Peekskill, New York called. He said he had a sighting to report. He saw the Gemini launch on television on 23 Mar 65 and saw some strange objects. He went on and on about believing in flying saucers and would not listen to anything that Major Quintanilla had to say, he kept insisting that we were keeping things secret and should make it known that these vehicles were extraterrestrial and under intelligent control."
