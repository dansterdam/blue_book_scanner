The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line in the sky with rays or beams extending from it, likely depicting a UFO sighting. The second sketch shows a road or path with trees or foliage on the sides, likely depicting a UFO sighting from the ground. The third sketch shows a silhouetted figure standing on a hill or mountain against a cloudy sky, also likely depicting a UFO sighting.

37. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please on a 8"x11" outline paper use a pencil to draw how high the object moved across the sky (skyline) and how long of a trail it left. This will help us to determine the size and speed. NOTE: Use the time given for the sighting as a guide.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and an "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this larger sketch.
