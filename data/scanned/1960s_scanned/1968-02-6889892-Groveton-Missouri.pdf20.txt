He is, however, hypnotized and although he tells me he can drive without glasses, his memory does not see to run as well as it did. He had his glasses on when we discussed this case more closely than he did.

This case was considered as unidentified. Since it is a one-witness case (as we exclude the cows as witnesses) we are left with the reality that this man has been subjected to some traumatic experience by way of a vivid dream or an outright hallucination. We do not understand under what conditions such hallucinations may occur or what their psychological meaning is for the individual in question.

One out of 20 people are capable of deep trance hypnosis. In some cases in which he has hypnotized people, the people who have had encounters (with phenomena) have shown a deeper trance capability than otherwise expected, according to the hypnotist. The question remains whether they are also hallucinating or whether they are also remembering correctly while in the trance state what they believe they have perceived.

An examination of Mr. [redacted] as to whether he had ever been hypnotized and he said that he never had, and that "none of stuff" was out of his field."

So we do not assume hypnosis in this case as a factor, and there seems to be no period of missing time to account for a possible encounter, and there is no evidence of any physiological phenomena that could be associated with the alleged encounter. We are faced with the parapsychological conclusion that Mr. [redacted] did see something for which there is no ready explanation.
