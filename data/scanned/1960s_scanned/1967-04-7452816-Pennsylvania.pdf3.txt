The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, with handwritten text that describes the observer's sighting.

The text in the document reads:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 17 APRIL 1969
Day Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The sighting was reported to the local police immediately. The craft or object was unconventional in appearance, hovering silently some distance from the observer's location. The object or craft appeared to be metallic, reflecting some of the moon's light. Approximate size was estimated to be around 30 feet in diameter. The object or craft hovered motionless for several minutes, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. No sound was reported.
