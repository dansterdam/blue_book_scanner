I will be very interested in obtaining your analysis of this metal for comparative purposes. Roberts O. Acheson of Villa Park, Illinois, advised me that he has given me a piece of this Park, and I am very anxious to have it analyzed at the University of Chicago for study. Bob Achsener and I are co-chairmen of the Illinois Section of the Research Organization with headquarters in Tucson, Arizona. I am very proud to have organized the first such statewide section, which has since spread from Connecticut to California.

If I can be of further assistance, please call upon me, because I do appreciate the interest you have shown to date.

Sincerely,

Walter H. Andrus, Jr.
