Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

In reference to your letter of May 9, 1968 concerning the U.F.O. I did see this round red or orange object in the sky behind the Graniteville Park Arena on that date (12/29/67) 10:00 P.M. to 11:30 P.M.)

Officer D. T. Marchant and myself tried to catch the object but when we got close to it, it went away. It looked as if it went straight up, no noise.

Yours truly,
Max A. Meek
