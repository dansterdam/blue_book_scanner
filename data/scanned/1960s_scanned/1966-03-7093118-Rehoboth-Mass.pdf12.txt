AFIN: 27805 (2Apr66)  PG 3 of 3

SIGHTING IS 5MI. FROM THE HILLSGROVE R.I. AIRPORT CONTROL. 
THE MANEUVERS OF THE OBJECT WOULD SUGGEST AN AIRCRAFT WITH
LANDING LIGHTS ON, EITHER HAVING TAKEN OFF OR MAKING AN
APPROACH TO HILLSGROVE FLYING IN A DIRECT LINE TO THE OB-
SERVERS. THIS WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THE LIGHTS DIDNT MOVE BUT
WERE BRIGHT AND APPEARED BRIGHTER AS THE AIRCRAFT ACTUALLY
PROGRESSED TOWARD THEM. THE LIGHTS STARTING TO MOVE FOR-
WARD AND BECOMING GRADUALLY VERTICAL OF ONE ANOTHER AND
FADING WOULD INDICATE THE SAME AIRCRAFT MAKING A TURN TO THE
RIGHT WHICH WOULD GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT MOVING
WHILE THE LIGHTS PROGRESSED MOVING VERTICAL AND FADING.
K. WINCHELL, INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, DURING THE TIME THE OBJECT
WAS SIGHTED THERE WAS A AIRCRAFT TRAFFIC IN THE VICINITY OF
HILLSGROVE R.I. AIRPORT, WARWICK R.I.-- THE PREPARING OFFICER
BELIEVES THE AIRCRAFT TAXI LIGHTS OR LANDING LIGHTS FROM AN
AIRCRAFT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SIGHTING.
