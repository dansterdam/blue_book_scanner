The image appears to contain a photograph of what looks like a radar or sonar display. The display shows a circular pattern with a large object or anomaly in the center. There are some handwritten notes or annotations visible at the bottom of the image.

1963-05-8655540-44N49W-Atlantic-
22 May 1963
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object
LOCATION: 44N 49W (Atlantic Ocean)
TIME: 1623Z
OBSERVED BY: Crew of MSTS Ship Pvt. Joe E. Mann
DESCRIPTION: An unidentified object was observed on the ship's radar screen. The object was first detected at a range of approximately 100 miles and closing rapidly on the ship's position. The object was only visible on the radar scope and did not appear to have any running lights or other aircraft identification markings. The object passed over the ship at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet and a speed of approximately 3,000 mph. The object was then observed to accelerate and disappear from the radar screen.
CONCLUSION: The object is considered to be an unidentified aerial phenomenon. No logical explanation for the observed object could be determined based on the information available.
