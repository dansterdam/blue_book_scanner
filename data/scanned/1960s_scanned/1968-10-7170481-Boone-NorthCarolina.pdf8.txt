Air Force UFO form continued

Charles was outside by a friend and noticed an object in the sky at around 7:45 p.m. on the date of the sighting. The object was in the eastern part of the sky and was very large and bright. It seemed to be hovering and then moved away very rapidly. Charles and his friend watched this object for several minutes. Charles believed the object was not a conventional aircraft and that it was a UFO. He said that the object was too large and too bright to be a star or another known celestial object. Charles also stated that the object moved in a manner that was inconsistent with conventional aircraft. He could not provide any further details about the object's size, shape, or color.
