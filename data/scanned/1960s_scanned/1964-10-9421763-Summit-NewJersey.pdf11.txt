Washington, D.C.

Dear Major Jacke:

As you undoubtedly know, last evening, the 2nd of October 1964, a spaceecraft or unknown origin landed in a field in Broward County, Florida. The landing was witnessed by a local resident. 

The spaceecraft was approximately thirty feet in diameter, six to seven feet in thickness, and stood four feet above the ground on four (4) vertical supports or legs. When the object was observed, a "being" came forth from the object. This object was described as approximately five feet in height and wore a helmet. The creature brought forth an object similar to a book and took two readings or readings of the ground, and when doing so, the object or paper-like material. After the draft departure, the material was picked up and reported the sightings to the authorities.

Investigators from the Air Force base were sent to interview Mr. [redacted], and the loss of the craft left four impressions in the dirt which showed it to be an on-the-ground analysis of the cloth showed it to be an unknown material. The writing on the cloth has not yet been deciphered.
