SUBJECT: UFO Report, Kincheloe AFB, Michigan

TO: TDPT/UFO(Major Quintanilla)

1. Reference is made to sighting of 17 UFO's by radar at Kincheloe AFB, Michigan.

2. There is no positive way to either prove or disprove the presence of the reported UFO's from the radar data. The fact that SAGE radars at other locations did not observe the objects tends to indicate a local situation. The objects of necessity had to come from outside the observed area at some time, and should have been observed then (by the SAGE radars), if they were real objects. If they were, that fact seems anomalous.

3. The obvious "excuse" or "explanation" for the sightings appears to be temperature inversion. The erratic courses taken by the "objects" and their wide variations in speed (150 to 2000 MPH), appear to be consistent with such a phenomenon. An increase in temperature with altitude, sufficient to cause anomalous propagation, is assumed, all point toward anomalous propagation due to temperature inversions.
