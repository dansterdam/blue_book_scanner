The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The first sketch depicts a curved shape with radiating lines, labeled "4.8". The second sketch depicts an angled object in the sky with a profile view of the earth below it.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN BY THE "X". WHAT WOULD THE OBJECT LOOK LIKE TO YOU IF YOU LAST SAW IT? 

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "H" AT THE POSITION THE OBJECT WHEN YOU LAST SAW IT, AND DRAW A SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO CONTINUE THE OBJECT'S TRAIL.
