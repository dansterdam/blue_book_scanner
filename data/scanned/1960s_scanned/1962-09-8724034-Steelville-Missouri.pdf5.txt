There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten note on lined paper. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

And don't want me
to try and explain it. I was
curious to know if the object destroyed
itself as I have read it does sometimes.
What it looked like and how would it
look was cloudy the night it was
seen.
