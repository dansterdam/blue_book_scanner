Text from the image:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Plaeee an "A" to show the path, and "B" as the end of the path, and show any change in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, such as the head of the match. If you had performed this test of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw.
