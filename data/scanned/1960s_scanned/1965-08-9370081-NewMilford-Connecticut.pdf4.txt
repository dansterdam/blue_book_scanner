The image contains a black and white photograph that appears to be a page from a project blue book UFO report document. The document includes a diagram with a compass-like image and instructions for describing the position of an observed object in relation to the horizon and compass. There is also a section where the viewer is instructed to draw a picture showing the motion of the observed object or objects.

Text extracted from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the sighting.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
