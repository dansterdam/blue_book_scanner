This letter contains information regarding an unidentified flying object sighting which occurred in the area of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on 30 August 1962. The report is forwarded for your information.

In this sighting, the object was the planet Venus in the sky. The reported size of the object was approximately 2-3 times the size of a basketball or about 2 degrees in diameter. The duration of the sighting was 24 minutes 59 seconds. This location of the object would have caused it to be quite low on the horizon, approximately 10 minutes without moving.

The informant reported his belief that it was necessary to move the object by mechanical means. The apparent angular rate of motion of the object was approximately 1/3 of a degree per minute. This rate of motion is not unusual and could be accounted for by the normal apparent motion of a celestial object due to the rotation of the earth. The time required for the object to traverse the 2 degree diameter field of view was approximately 6 minutes.

The optical equipment used by the observer was not specified. However, the apparent size and motion of the object are consistent with an observation of the planet Venus under the stated conditions. No other unusual characteristics were reported.
