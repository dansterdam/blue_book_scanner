There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

recommendations to the Air Force. These recommendations, cur-rently under study, could lead to even stronger emphasis on the scientific aspects of investigating the relatively few sightings that warrant extensive analysis - perhaps 100 in a year.

Based on 10,147 reported sightings from 1947 through 1965 (attached), virtually all derived from subjective human observa-tions and interpretations, the Air Force has succeeded in identifying 9,501. The most common of these identified are astronomical sightings that include such things as bright stars and planets, and phenomena, such as comets and meteors, conventional streamers. Other major sources of reported sightings include objects such as satellites, aircraft and balloons; and phenomena such as reflections, mirages and spurious radar indications.

In its evaluation of these sightings, the Air Force has used carefully selected, highly qualified scientists, engineers, technicians and consultants; and has available its laboratories, test centers, scientific instrumentation, and technical equip-ment for this purpose. Although the past is years of investiga-ting unidentified flying objects have not identified any threat to our national security, or any evidence of extraterrestrial origin.
