CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA, MARCH 7 --(UPI)--A MYSTERIOUS FORMATION OF FLAMING LIGHTS, TRAVELING IN A STRANGE PATTERN, WAS SPOTTED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES TONIGHT. 
TOUCHING OFF AN AIR FORCE INVESTIGATION AND SPECULATION THAT IT MIGHT BE CONNECTED WITH A SATELLITE LAUNCHING. 
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE LIGHTS WERE FIRST SPOTTED OVER NORTH GEORGIA ABOUT 8:15 P.M. EST. 
THE NATIONAL SPACE AGENCY IN WASHINGTON CONFIRMED THAT NO SATELLITES WERE LAUNCHED FROM CAPE CANAVERAL TONIGHT.
BUT NASA AUTHORITIES SAID THAT THE INDICATIONS WERE THAT THE LIGHTS WERE OF NATURAL, NOT MAN-MADE, ORIGIN.
LABORATORIES AT CAPE CANAVERAL SAID THEY COULD OFFER NO EXPLANATION FOR THE LIGHTS, WHICH TRIGGERED A SMALL FLURRY OF TELEPHONING BETWEEN MILITARY AND CIVILIAN OFFICIALS.
THE ONLY THING WE CAN SAY RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE ARE INVESTIGATING," A SPOKESMAN SAID.
AN OFFICIAL AT CAPE CANAVERAL TOLD UPI THE LIGHTS WERE SIGHTED BY SEVERAL PERSONS AND APPARENTLY MOVED IN A NORTH-SOUTH DIRECTION AT A RAPID PACE.
IN NORTH CAROLINA, AND AT COLUMBUS, GA., WITNESSES REPORTED SEEING THE BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE SKY.
THE LIGHTS MADE NO SOUND AND LEFT NO VAPOR TRAIL, ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS. THE PIECES OF LIGHT APPEARED AS BRIGHT AS BURNING MAGNESIUM AND WERE OBSERVED CURVING GRACEFULLY TO THE HORIZON DUE EAST.
THE LIGHTS STARTED AS A CLOSELY-COLLECTED MASS OF FLAMING COLORED OBJECTS-POSSIBLY THEN SPREAD OUT AS THEY SHOT THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST. 
OF A SUDDEN, THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO BE FAST-MOVING BALLS SHOOTING ACROSS THE SKY, TRAILING FLAMES BEHIND THEM. AFTER ABOUT THREE MINUTES, THE DISPLAY FADED INTO BLACKNESS.
SEVERAL MINUTES LATER, THE LIGHTS REAPPEARED, TRAVELING OVER THE CAPE CANAVERAL AREA.
BUT ITS LIGHT WAS A BRILLIANT GREEN WITH A BLUISH TINGE. IT IS DESCRIBED AS RAPID AND BRILLIANT.
THIS OBJECT LEFT A VAPOR TRAIL, FAINTLY VISIBLE THROUGH BINOCULARS, AND IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE SKY.
MANY MISSILES LAUNCHED AT CAPE CANAVERAL AT NIGHT USUALLY SPORT LIGHTS ARE ACCURATELY TRACKED BY STATIONS ON THE GROUND.
