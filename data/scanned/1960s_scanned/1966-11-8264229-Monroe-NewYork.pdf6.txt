Normal traffic around Stewart AFB.

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
Mr. - is a sincere and believes in the UFO program and spends considerable time reading about and looking for unidentified flying objects. All this he has done voluntarily on his own, not as part of his official duties as a Captain. The object appears to be metallic and fairly small in size but with a definite shape.

He feels that he is a sincere and accurate in his reporting but he is unable to offer any information that could be scientifically investigated. The object he has reported could very easily have been aircraft traffic around Stewart AFB. No other evidence to the contrary has been offered.
