47. INFORMATION WHICH COULD BE ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE IS REQUIRED, BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

I believe it was not a gun, satellite, atmospheric disturbance, or anything else that would normally go to horizon to horizon, and I am sure that it was some kind of flying object at some time of flying
at a tremendous speed as I cannot pinpoint that I can determine what it was. If it was some kind of military aircraft, I cannot estimated speed or identification.

P.S. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to assist in this matter. The Air Force should give greater attention, publicity, and research to this UFO phenomenon that have taken place.
