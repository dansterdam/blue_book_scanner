The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with a form filled out by hand. I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 2 Apr 1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

4: About 8:30 p.m. Circular craft over trees
