UFO - 'Size of Automobile' is Reported
(TEXT FROM THE ARTICLE)
(FAY DONAT, PRATTVILLE [CALIF.])
A UFO, described as being the size of an automobile, was sighted by three people at Prattville, approximately 25 miles northeast of Sacramento, Calif., on Monday, June 9.
The object, according to the three witnesses, was seen at 11:15 p.m. as they were driving along Highway 70. It was described as hovering over the road in front of them, about 100 feet in the air, and giving off a brilliant, white light. After about a minute, the object shot straight up and disappeared from view.
Mrs. Bill Johnson, who was driving the car, told The Record, a Prattville newspaper, that she and her two companions were traveling south on Highway 70 when the incident occurred. "We were driving along and all of a sudden we saw this brilliant white light in front of us, not too high off the ground," she said. "It seemed to be hovering over the road. We stopped the car and watched it for about a minute. Then it shot straight up and disappeared. I've never seen anything like it before."
The object was seen by Mrs. Johnson, her daughter Mrs. Claude Norton, and another woman, Mrs. Hinkle. Mrs. Norton said the object was "perfectly round" and gave off a brilliant white light. "It was so bright it hurt our eyes to look at it," she added. "It just hovered there for about a minute and then took off straight up and was gone."
Mrs. Hinkle also described the object as being "the size of an automobile" and stated that it was "giving off a brilliant white light." "It was definitely not an airplane or a satellite," she said. "I've never seen anything like it before in my life."
The three women reported the incident to the Butte County Sheriff's office, which in turn notified the Air Force. Lt. Henry A. Mebane, public information officer at Beale AFB, said the Air Force is investigating the report.
