There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page of text from an old UFO report document.

Well, the thing that was amazing about this was the color. It was completely unnatural, even in the source of the light at times it seemed. It looked to be of an intensity. Yes, that intensity. Let's see, how can we describe it -- for parts the intensity was so low that it was nearly invisible, yet at the same time, when I first saw it, it was approximately the same as a brilliant cloud shining at sunset.

Well, I don't know what I can say that at the brightest, when I first saw it,
was approximately the same as a brilliant cloud shining at sunset. 

I still can't say how I can describe my feelings exactly when I said it
was unreal.

I wish I could say something like that. I never have before. These two possibly associated events are the only things like this that I have ever seen.
