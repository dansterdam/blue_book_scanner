11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
This object was sighted at a distance looked similar to the landing lights of an airplane. When closer however the object appeared roughly circular and had what appeared as windows along the side. The object had a steady floating motion and disappeared towards the southeast. The object passed closer than permissible to an eastbound transport. Documents concerning the observation of this object are similar to Satellite decay. However it would not have been traveling westerly in its orbit. Since the object passed closer to the transport, one would expect the pilot to have seen the object. However nothing was recorded.
FTD SEP 63 0329 (TDE) Previous versions of this form may not be used. Westbound plane with both its landing lights on.
