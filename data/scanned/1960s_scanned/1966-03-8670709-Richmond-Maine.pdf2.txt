Gentlemen:
On Wednesday evening, March 23, 1966, my daughter and I observed what I believe to be a flying saucer in the Richmond, Maine area. I had first called Air Force Command of the Augusta area, and Lt. Simonds came out to take a personal observation. I had a very good opportunity to observe the object, and it was most definately shaped like the typical concept of a flying saucer. It was fairly low to the ground, about 200 to 300 yards away, and crossed towards the northeast, the direction of Gardiner, Maine. The object appeared to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, was disc-shaped, had a number of definite large lights around the circumference as well as a central brilliant light of great intensity in the center. The object crossed our line of vision at a rapid pace, without any sound, and disappeared from sight. The movement and configuration of the lights gave the impression of a rotating motion or action. Many other people in this area have also observed similar lights and objects in this area during the past year. I am quite certain that what we observed was a genuine unidentified flying object, and I am writing to your office to report this observation. Please let me know if you would like any additional details.
Yours Truly,
