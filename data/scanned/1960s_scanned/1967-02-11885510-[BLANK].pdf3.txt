There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page of text from an old UFO report document.

The text in the document states:

"them at least must have planets," etc. It is impossible at the present time to prove or disprove the existence of planets of the size of the earth even around the nearest stars, let alone life on these planets. Therefore, the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is at the present time an article of faith rather than a scientific fact. In this respect, scientists are in exactly the same position as their predecessors were in the 18th Century, or even the ancient Greeks 2,000 years ago. The only difference considered extremely significant by the proponents of life in the universe is modern man's possession of radio communication techniques capable of reaching out to 1,000 light years and more. How to utilize this capability is the subject of animated discussion among the radio astronomers in the West and the USSR.
