The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document describing a UFO sighting.

Seconds, and shortly thereafter a point-object emerged from behind the cloud and moved eastward. It changed color from white to blue and appeared to accelerate rapidly, disappearing to the east, perhaps into clouds. The observer took many pictures, with a 35 mm camera having a 135 mm telephoto lens. Two frames that were published show an odd-shaped object near the bottoms of the frames; these resemble strong underpass supports with diffuse illumination behind them, and according to the observer are not like the object he first saw. Another published frame shows four wavering streaks, reported as being "the" UFO, plus three others that were not noticed when the pictures were taken. The lateral variations in path match exactly on all four tracks; they are clearly the images of stars, formed as the camera was slowly panned. The stars are the three "belt" stars of Orion, followed by Rigel. It seems that the observer was trying to photograph something, but succeeded only in recording irrelevant background material. There is no evidence of an intentional fraud.

It is highly probable that the observer saw not one but two objects; the first was not positively identified, but the second was all the characteristics of an airplane. The first object was not sufficiently well observed to permit making an evaluation. One might guess that Arcturus (if actually in the right position) might have been behind a haze layer, thus giving the appearance of an extended object. This is only a guess. The only reason given by the observer for associating the second object with the first, despite the great difference in appearance, was that it appeared immediately after the oval was covered by a cloud.
