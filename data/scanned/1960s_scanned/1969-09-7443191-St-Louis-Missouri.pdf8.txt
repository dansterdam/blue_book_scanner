The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. 

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
CHANGE IN SIZE AND SPEED? 
CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE IN SHAPE?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
LEAVE A TRAIL?
FLUTTER, SOBLE?
14. WHAT ELSE CAN YOU ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

3. I was looking for stars when this saw this

a. DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Believe it got sight at day break

b. DID THE OBJECT MOVE, HOVERING OR DARTING IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?  
No
