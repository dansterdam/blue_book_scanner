Analysis of Photographs (-------, Jr.)

SUBJECT (SAFCI-3E - Major Colonna)

1. The enclosed photographs have been examined by the FTD photo
analysts. The details necessary to identify the object shown were
developed.

2. Analysis - The object is analyzed, however, may have been
exposed during prior development or handling. The object shine, flutter, and is too diffuse could indicate it was not caused by a longer outdoor exposure. The indoor appears due to the fact that the light apparently came from the immediate vicinity.

3. It is the analysis opinion that the photographs are a deliberate hoax, caused by the procedure employed in their preparation.
