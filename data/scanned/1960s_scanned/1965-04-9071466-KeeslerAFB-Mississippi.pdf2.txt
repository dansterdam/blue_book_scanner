COMMENTS

FAA: The observer at first thought the object was an aircraft, and he called FAA. The FAA station has no record of the sighting. A radar check indicated no targets in the area at the time of the sighting. A telephone check with control tower at Keesler indicated they had no information on the sighting. This witness stated that the object was quite different from any aircraft he had ever before seen. There was a searchlight in use four miles away from the witness, and this may have had some effect, but it never before seen this type of object.

Another possible alternative is a satellite sighting. The lights were the same color and had four lights rather than one, and had four lights rather than one. With such available information, the case is carried as unidentified. All alternatives are not substantiated with conclusive data to warrant a definite explanation.
