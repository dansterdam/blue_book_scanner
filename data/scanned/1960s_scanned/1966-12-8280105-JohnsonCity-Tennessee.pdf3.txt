Here is the text transcribed from the document:

That night a real bright light came up from behind the mountain and hoveredright over the house for few minutes. It was about the size of a basketballwhich was bright and slowly moving. It seemed to be a light that was changing shape and was bright in the middle and dimmer toward the outside. There was no sound from it and it hovered over the house for 3 or 4 minutes then went back down behind the mountain. This was the secone time this has happened. The first time was about 2 weeks ago when it did the same thing. I dont know what it could be but it sure is strange. It doesn't look like anything I have ever seen before.
