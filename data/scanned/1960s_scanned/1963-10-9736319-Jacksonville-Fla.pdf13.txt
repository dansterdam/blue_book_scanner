UFO Observed From Home
Mrs. G. Kimball of Dover-Foxcroft, Maine (APRO member) saw a bright star-like object while looking out the window of her home on the night of October 9, 1963. After observing it for some moments, the UFO moved from the original position up in the sky toward the east and disappeared. The UFO was of an undefined shape and was described as being of a bright and gray color underneath. The witness felt that she had seen what would normally resemble a window. It made no noise and was visible for approximately 5 minutes, which was about 11:00 p.m.
