"Date 8-22-62 (1:00 AM) Location: Virginia Beach, Virginia The object I am enclosing here is a natural color photo to show. It is the same color that resembled the tail end of the craft. The object hovered to be still for a color change. I would like the days weather report to be checked as it was the day I took this photo and a report on my conditions."
