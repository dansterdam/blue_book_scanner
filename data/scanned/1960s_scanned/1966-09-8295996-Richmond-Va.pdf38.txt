The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an unclassified document from the Department of the Air Force discussing a space experiment that ejected a barium and copper oxide payload from a four-stage rocket fired from Wallops Island, Virginia. The document describes the creation of a huge multi-colored cloud which covered hundreds of miles of the sky and was visible at high altitudes for about 45 minutes. The document also mentions that the object sighted was believed to be the NASA-created cloud and that the swirling motion observed was caused by the expansion of the cloud, certain maneuvers of which "Captain Maurer believes his sighting was the most logical conclusion is that the observer and his fellow officers saw the NASA space cloud which reported was visible from widely scattered areas of the country."

A SPACE EXPERIMENT WHICH EJECTED A BARIUM AND COPPER OXIDE PAYLOAD
FROM A FOUR-STAGE-ROCKET FIRED FROM ITS TEST RANGE AT WALLOPS ISLAND,
VIRGINIA. THE SPACE EXPERIMENT CREATED A HUGE MULTI-COLORED CLOUD
WHICH COVERED HUNDREDS OF MILES OF THE SKY AND WAS VISIBLE AT HEIGHTS
310 TO 570 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES. SETTING OFF
PAGE 4 RUMORS, UFO REPORTS UPON LEARNING OF THE SPACE EXPERIMENT.
MAJOR BUNCE ADVISED THAT HE BELIEVES THAT WHAT HE SAW WAS THE NASA-
CREATED CLOUD AND THAT THE SWIRLING MOTION HE OBSERVED WAS CAUSED
BY THE EXPANSION OF THE CLOUD. CAPTAIN MAURER BELIEVES HIS SIGHTING
ALSO WAS THE CLOUD, ON THE BASIS OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THE
MOST LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS THAT THE OBSERVER AND HIS FELLOW OFFICERS
SAW THE NASA SPACE CLOUD WHICH REPORTED WAS VISIBLE FROM WIDELY
SCATTERED AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. ALTHOUGH THIS SIGHTING WAS ORIGINALLY
ALLY DISCREISED AS COMET-LIKE, A COMET PROBABLY WOULD DO HAVE BEEN
VISIBLE FOR SO LONG A PERIOD. WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE SUTTABLE IF
THE OBSERVATIONS REPORTED AND IN THE ABSENCE OF REPORTS ON ANY
OTHER PHENOMENA, THE SPACE CLOUD IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN THE
OBJECT SIGHTED. 141s NONE.
