15 AUGUST 1965 

WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, MISSOURI

1. On the night of 6 August 1965, at approximately 2100 hours, the undersigned and other military personnel were outside the main gate at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, on a security check. 

2. While performing this security check, the undersigned and others observed in the northwest sky an unidentified bright object. This object was circular in shape, larger than a star, and hovering or traveling at a very slow speed. The object appeared to be self-luminous as it emitted its own light. 

3. The object was observed for approximately 45 minutes while it moved about in the northwest sky area. There were no blinking lights or sound emitted from the object. The object suddenly accelerated at a rapid speed and disappeared from sight. 

4. The undersigned reported this incident to the base Operations Center and an investigation was conducted. No satisfactory explanation of this incident has been determined.
