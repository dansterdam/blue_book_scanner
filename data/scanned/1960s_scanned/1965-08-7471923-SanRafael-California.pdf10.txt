One of the most interested constituents who is very much interested and has been following the subject of unidentified flying objects.

It is stated that the report said the objects were moving out of the southeast at a rate of 1700 to 1800 miles per hour. And they were sighted over Duluth and jet interceptors gave chase.

Your comment on the above will be appreciated.

Very truly yours,
