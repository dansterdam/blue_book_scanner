The object, the object was observed by a building & went to the rear of the building, appeared to rise up, but it was no longer visible. 11/16/67, Dean Aden's object, 9 to 9:55 pm, moving southeast, 11:30/67, 10:55 E.S.T, 10:05 p.m., moving East-North-East, 11/21/67, 7:30 p.m. to 8:59 p.m., moving North-Northeast, 11/22/67, same, 7:30 p.m. to 8:59 p.m., moving North-Northeast. 4/15/67 (approx) List my name on this. Most important observation to date - Object appeared stationary at 9:27 to 9:28 p.m. I was sitting in my office, when the object appeared in the sky, and moved in a northerly direction. The object appeared to be a most brilliant white light, and seemed to be hovering, but I was unable to detect any shape or form to the object, apart from the brilliant white light which seemed to pulsate or flicker at times. The object remained stationary for about one minute. It then moved off at a high rate of speed in a northerly direction, and disappeared from sight. I cannot estimate the height at which the object was observed, but I can say that it was high enough above the horizon that I had to look up to see it. I got out of my car to observe the object, it was overhead, and I watched it disappear. I did not see any other aircraft, that I am aware of, in the vicinity at the time the object was observed.
