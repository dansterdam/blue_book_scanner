The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified flying object. The sketch shows a disc-shaped object with a dome on top and a ring around the middle, similar to a classic "flying saucer" depiction. The text below the sketch provides a description of the object, referring to it as a "GLOWING LIGHT" that "SEEMED SOLID".

Now, as an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

No Case (Information Only) 1 January 1963 
N. Canton, Ohio

LOCAL SIGHTINGS: GREATER AKRON AREA
Jan. 1, 1962 - 5:15 a.m. - North Canton, Ohio. The air-force canton airport Mr. Roy Dennis was nearly home when he sited an oval, large, bright, red object. It was 250 yards in elevation. When he reached home a minute later the object had diminished in size and appeared elliptical in shape, with an edge that appeared vertical and was tilted downward from top to bottom vertical to the orange object. After 2 minutes continuous observation, the whole remaining object diminished in size until it could no longer be seen. Duration: 2 to 3 minutes. Later the object came into view again, same axil tilt. Because of clouds coming in from the west, his view was occasionally obscured but the object could be seen. The object could be seen through thin clouds at times. Duration: 20 minutes overall. No sound, trail, change in color, no cloud.
