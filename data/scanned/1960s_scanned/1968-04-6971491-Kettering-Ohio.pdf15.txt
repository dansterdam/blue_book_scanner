The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a blank form or template with instructions for drawing a picture that shows the shape of a phenomenon, including any details such as wings, protrusions, or exhaust/vapor trails, and indicating the direction of the phenomenon using an arrow.

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE (HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON). NEXT MOVE THE OBJECT UNTIL IT IS COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD. HOW MANY TIMES WIDER OR LONGER THAN THE MATCH HEAD WAS THE OBJECT? THIS WILL GIVE YOU A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON.
