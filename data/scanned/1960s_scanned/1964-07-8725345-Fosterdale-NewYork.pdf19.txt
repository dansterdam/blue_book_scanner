1. In compliance with Special Order M-173 (Attachment 1) and AFR 200-2, I interviewed Mr. [redacted] on 29 August 1964.

2. The following observations were made during my interview with Mr. [redacted] on 29 August 1964:
a. Mr. [redacted] is a high school student, residing with his parents on a farm. He is 17 years old. I interviewed him at his parents' home.
b. He has an interest in observing moving astronomical phenomena. He uses a telescope and "Sciencer News". He states that he is a member of the Sky and Telescope Society. "Sciencer News" is described by him as an "open-minded" magazine.
c. Mr. [redacted] claims to have a recreation farm for 160 aged guests of the Worker's Benefit Fund. They appear to be kept "fully occupied by the guests and only slightly aware of UFO research."
3. On 3 September 1964, Mr. [redacted] telephoned me. He inquired if I would lend USAF prestfge in order to secure permission from the Board of Directors, Worker's Benefit Fund, to use the farm as an UFO observation post. I declined.
