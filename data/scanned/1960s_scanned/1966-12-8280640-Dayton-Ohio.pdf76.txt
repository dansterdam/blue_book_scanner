There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

"I was traveling south on Rt. 11 between Nelletsville and New Milford. I was a slightly reddish light in the sky to the south east. When I first saw it, it was about the size of a star because it was very cloudy and hazy that night. As the object neared, it became much clearer and brighter so I could see it better. As I came closer, the object moved directly towards me and as I came up, it started to getting lower. On a few seconds, it was directly above me, about 200 feet. Three of the lights of my car began flickering lower and lower. The car radio held been playing suddenly went static, dead. The object drifted up to the west and looked like the bottom of a large round object with two red lights, going away from the object.

This is not an identifying a human face request, so I will not attempt to identify any individuals in the image. Please let me know if you need anything else.
