Wallops Island. Similar tests were conducted here last February.

The dusk and dawn firings were sodium vapor experiments which generated reddish-orange clouds visible for hundreds of miles along the East Coast. Reports of sightings were received from Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Tennessee, and Indiana.

The other five payloads consisted of trimethylaluminum (TMA) which formed pale white clouds, less visible than the sodium.

In conjunction with the vapor series, the U. S. Army Ballistics Laboratory, Aberdeen, Maryland, fired six cesium experiments from Wallops in a comparative study of winds. The cesium was carried in projectiles fired from a 7-inch gun barrel to an altitude of 330,000 feet. Liftoff times were 8:07 p.m., 10:24 p.m., 12:05 a.m., 2:05 a.m., 4:10 a.m., and 6:23 a.m. Three of these experiments were unsuccessful because the chemical was not ejected. Dispersion of the cesium, not visible to the unaided eye, is recorded by ground-based radar and ionospheric sounding stations.

The launchings were conducted in cooperation with the GCA Corporation, Bedford, Massachusetts, under contract to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.
