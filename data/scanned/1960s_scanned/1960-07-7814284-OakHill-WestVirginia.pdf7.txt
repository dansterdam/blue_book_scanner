Mr. Lawrence E. Tacker
Lt. Colonel, USAF
PIO Division
Department of Air Force
Washington 25, D.C. 

Dear Mr. Tacker:

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of July 12 concerning sightings of unidentified flying objects used in this area on July 11.

You stated along with the clippings, were forwarded to the Aerial Phenomena Branch Intelligence Center for their possible evaluation.

Several individuals in the Oak Hill vicinity have inquired about the objects. The reply we gave us is of no help in answering their inquiries.

We would like any information concerning what we saw if it is possible for you to release such news.

Some questions we are being asked are: What were they? Will there be any more? If so, when?

Any news you might provide for us would greatly be appreciated.

Sincerely yours,
THE FAYETTE TRIBUNE
