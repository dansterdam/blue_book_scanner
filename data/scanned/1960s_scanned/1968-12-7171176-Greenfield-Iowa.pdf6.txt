27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are looking at a place and "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon. Place an "B" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was more than one object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.

Apparently the observer was shown multiple objects and asked to indicate how high the objects were above the horizon and how the objects moved and were arranged. The report seems to be soliciting detailed observations and drawings from the witness.
