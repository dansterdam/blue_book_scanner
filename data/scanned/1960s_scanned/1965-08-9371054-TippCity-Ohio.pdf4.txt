The image contains a filled-in questionnaire form, but there is no photograph present in this particular page.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something or only appear to be partly obscured? (Circle One):
    Yes No Don't Know
    IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
    (Circle One): 
    Yes No Don't Know
    IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following details about the object:
    a. Sound
    b. Size
    c. Shape

18. We wish to know the duration of the sighting. Was it in line with a known object such much of the object is obscured by the field of view of the observer? (If you had performed this measurement at the time of sighting, write the duration of the sighting in minutes and seconds.)

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape and the motion of the object. Include in your sketch any country side features like roads, hills, or other things you saw. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
