This page of the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten report or account of a UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

We said jokingly, "It looks like a flying saucer." Almost instantly, an ovate, glowing object appeared in the sky to the west, moving rapidly across our field of vision. It was hovering and appeared to have a low altitude. It was oval in shape, about the size of a dime held at arm's length, and was glowing with a dull, orange-red color. As we watched, it flashed a bright white light and then it was gone. The incident happened so quickly that none of us had time to take a photograph, though we were all watching intently and hoping for something just like this to happen.

This object was seen by four of us at the same time, under good visual conditions. The sky was clear and the moon was bright, though not full. The object was visible for only a few seconds, disappearing rapidly to the east. It gave no engine sound and did not leave any trail. The experience left all of us somewhat shaken and wondering just what we had seen. Other than the fact that it did not conform to our knowledge of any conventional aircraft, we have no explanation for it. If this were an isolated incident, we might pass it off, but it is one of several we have seen in this area over the past year or so.

The one thing I feel sure of is that we saw something very real and solid, and not just a fleeting illusion or reflection. While I have no proof, I am convinced that there is something to the UFO phenomenon, much as I would like to find a normal explanation for what we saw. There are too many sightings by reliable observers, including military and scientific personnel, to simply dismiss the whole business.
