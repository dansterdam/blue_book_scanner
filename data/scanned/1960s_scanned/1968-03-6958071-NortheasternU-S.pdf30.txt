March 6, 1968

Dear sir:

This report of the sighting is apparently not acceptable, as the case had been closed sometime ago. The reasons for this at the time of the original report are not clear.

Careful screening of 1968 records shows that there has been no known occurrence of unusual lights or objects northeastward of Boston, Mass. during the date and time period mentioned.

Accordingly, there is no further action which can be taken in this instance. The incident appears to have been a routine observation and not a matter which would warrant more detailed investigation.

Sincerely yours,
[name redacted]
