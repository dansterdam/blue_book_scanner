ON 26 JULY 1965 I SIGHTED AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT "LIGHT" TO THE WEST AT ABOUT 10:00 PM. OBJECT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS THEN MOVED RAPIDLY TO THE EAST NORTHEAST FOR ABOUT 1/2 MINUTE, THEN DISAPPEARED. IT WAS OF SUCH INTENSITY THAT IT VIRTUALLY CAUSED A BLINDING EFFECT. IT SEEMED TO BE THE SIZE OF A FULL MOON. IT PRODUCED NO SOUND AND NO TRAIL OR EXHAUST. IT WAS A STEADY, BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT. IT APPEARED TO BE AT A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE. ESTIMATED SPEED WAS AROUND 1000 KNOTS. IT APPEARED MOTIONLESS ON FIRST SIGHTING THEN MOVED ERRATICALLY AND RAPIDLY EASTWARD, THEN DISAPPEARED RATHER ABRUPTLY. I BELIEVE IT WAS SOME SORT OF UNCONVENTIONAL AIRBORNE OBJECT OF UNKNOWN CHARACTERISTICS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE.
COULD NOT SEE ANY SHAPE OR FORM - JUST A WHITE LIGHT.
JULY 14 - COUNTY RECORDER
JULY 15 - AIRFORCE CONTACTED - NO SIGHTINGS REPORTED IN AREA THAT NIGHT
APPARENTLY SOME SORT OF UNCONVENTIONAL AERIAL OBJECT - SPEED, MANEUVERABILITY AND LIGHT INTENSITY SEEMED TO BE BEYOND CAPABILITIES OF KNOWN AIRCRAFT.
