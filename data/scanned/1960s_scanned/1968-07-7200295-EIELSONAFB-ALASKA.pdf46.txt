The text in the document is as follows:

The observations that were made during this incident can cast considerable doubt as to the existence of a structure of the type that was observed. At the time of the observations, there was apparently a belief that the object was a solid, metallic structure that was seen against a dark background. However, some of the physical effects that were observed, and the manner in which the object disappeared, tend to cast doubt on the solidness of the structure. For example, the fact that the object could apparently "fold into itself" and disappear, and the fact that it was observed to change color and intensity during the sighting, would indicate that it was not a solid, metallic structure as it first appeared. It is quite possible that what was observed was actually some type of atmospheric phenomenon or optical illusion, and was not a solid physical structure at all.

Investigations of the characteristics of this incident have raised some questions as to the validity of the observations. While sightings of this type do occur, and while they may represent something of considerable scientific interest, the physical effects observed in this case tend to cast doubt on the interpretation that a solid, metallic structure was seen. It is important that all aspects of such incidents be carefully evaluated before conclusions are drawn as to the nature of the observed phenomena.
