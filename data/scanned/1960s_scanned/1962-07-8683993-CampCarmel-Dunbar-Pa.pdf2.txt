Gentlemen:

On 12 July 1962, at about 10:30 PM EST, at Camp Carmel near 
Dunbar, Fayette County, Pa., I sighted what I believe were two "unidenti-
fied flying objects". Rather than belabor you with details in this letter,
I have compiled the information in the form of your "U.S. Air Force Technical
Information Sheet" which apparently applies to such unidentified objects.
Kindly find this information.

This matter may already have been the subject of official interest
to your organization, for about fifteen minutes after the objects disappeared, 
one or more jet planes appeared, apparently in search of the objects.

Perhaps I should mention that I am not a member of any organization
attempting to find or prove the existence of unidentified flying objects.

If you are interested in this matter, and wish further information,
naturally I should be most pleased to oblige.
