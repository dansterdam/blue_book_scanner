There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing a series of questions and instructions.

The text from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One)    Yes    No    Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of or something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One)    Yes    No    Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: No sound at all
b. Color: Dull washed-out silver

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the hand of the match. If you had performed this measurement at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
Only a small fraction of the object would have been covered by the match stick.

19. Draw a sketch that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the contours and surface which you have noted, such as portholes, "fins", and so on. Place an arrow to indicate the direction the object was moving.
