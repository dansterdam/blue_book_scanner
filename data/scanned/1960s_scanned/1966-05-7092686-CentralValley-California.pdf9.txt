Text extracted from the document:

I can't think of any other explanation for the most remarkable occurrence of this evening's experience, as a bright light zoomed across the sky with a loud roar for about a minute. At first I thought it was just the normal high flying jet, but it seemed to be travelling much faster than the average jet, and the light was much brighter. As the object passed overhead I could see it was not a jet, but an extremely bright light that seemed to pick up speed as it travelled from east to west. There was no discernible noise, just a very bright light that seemed to be glowing. I phoned the local newspaper office to report the incident, but they were not able to give me any information on what the object might have been.
