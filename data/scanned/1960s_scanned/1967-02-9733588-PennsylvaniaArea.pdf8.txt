34. Date you completed this questionnaire: FEB 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire:
WE WERE DRIVING ALONG IN OUR WAY TO STATION WAGON AND PASSENGERS AND WERE APPROACHING A CT^UMPED CROSSROADS LIGHT AS DAWN SEEMED TO BE COMING.
A GLIMPSE OF SOMETHING LIGHT IN THE SKY WE LOOKED UP AND WE COULD SEE TWO DIFFERENT LIGHTS MOVING IN A STRANGE MANNER, NOT USUAL TO ANYTHING WE HAD EVER SEEN.
WE STOPPED AND WATCHED AND AS WE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT IT WE GOT OUT AND LOOKED AT IT, AND HEARD AT IT, AND LOOKED AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SEEMED TO BE GAINING HEIGHT VERY RAPIDLY AND IT WAS LEAVING US AND WE KNEW IT WASN'T A REFLECTION BECAUSE IT HAD APPEARED ABOVE US. WE KNEW BY THE WAY IT MOVED AND THE SPEED IT MOVED IT WASN'T A REFLECTION. I KNOW IT WASN'T A REFLECTION BECAUSE I KNOW AFTER WE GOT OUT OF THE CAR, THE CAR ITSELF WASN'T REFLECTING ANYTHING, SO IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A REFLECTION..
THE SKY WAS SORT OF PINK AND GRAY AND THE LIGHT WAS A WHITISH COLOR AND IT SEEMED TO BE PULSATING.
US SERIOULY AND WE HOPE YOU WILL MAKE AN INVESTIGATION, BUT I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT QUITE UNIDENTIFIED. WE REALIZE YOU HAVE DONE SOME STUDIES AND THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DIFFERENCE. ANY TIME AND COOPERATION.
SIGNED,
