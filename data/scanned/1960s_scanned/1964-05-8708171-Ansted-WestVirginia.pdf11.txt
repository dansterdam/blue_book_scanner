14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? This object was in sight only momentarily. I tried to catch it but it disappeared behind some trees and did not come back to the object which was gone.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes _May have passed behind a cloud or something_ No Don't Know? IF you answered YES, then tell what
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No _Don't Know_ IF you answered YES, then tell what
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound _Seemed to be silent_
b. Color _As bright as brilliant than the Sun_
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have not performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the head of a kitchen match held at arm's length? _The object would have been covered by less than 1/8 of the match head_
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. _hand-drawn sketch of a round or elliptical object with a tail moving towards the ground_
