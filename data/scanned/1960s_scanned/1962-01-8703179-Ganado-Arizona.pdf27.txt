21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? C 5Â° 45 t

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

Yes. Gradually faded and finally disappeared. Watching for 30 minutes.
