There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page appears to be a letter responding to a request for information about sightings in the Cyprus Gardens, Florida area.

Text from the document:

DEAR SIR:
This is in reply to your letter requesting information concerning "unusual object" seen near Cyprus Gardens, Florida, on 3 August 1961.

I261 had been made that the only report to the Air Force on a sighting in the Cyprus Gardens area on 3 August 1961 was attributed to a meteorite. This is inaccurate.

The description of your sighting as characteristics of objects reported which have been positively identified as jet aircraft or balloons is interesting. However, it is not possible to totally discount your sighting due to the great time lapse.

If you would furnish the Air Force Project Blue Book with a report on "Project sightings, the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects will record and analyze the details of your sighting. Your cooperation in reporting your observation to the Air Force is appreciated.

Sincerely,

Chief, Blue Book Report
First, Syracuse, New York
