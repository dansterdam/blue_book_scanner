Analysis and Conclusions: It appears that the object sighted was a meteor or high altitude aircraft, as there were no confirming witnesses or other evidence to establish the presence of an actual unidentified flying object. The relatively brief duration and solitary observation suggests the sighting was of a natural or man-made object rather than an extraterrestrial phenomenon.
