SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY
60 GARDEN STREET CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS 02138
APRIL 20, 1965

Mr. D. Fowler
323 Friend Court
Wenham, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Fowler:

Enclosed is the UFO report I referred to on the phone today. I hope you have better luck tracking down this object than I did finding the meteorite that prompted the correspondence between Mr. Gifford and me.

I will certainly attempt to convey any further reports of this nature to you in the future.

Sincerely,
James E. Cornell, Jr.
Public Information Officer
