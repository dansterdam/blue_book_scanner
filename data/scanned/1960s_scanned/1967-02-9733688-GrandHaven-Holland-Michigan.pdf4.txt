The shared image does not appear to contain a photograph. It seems to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically the 1967-02-9733688-GrandHaven-Holland-Michigan.pdf4.txt file.

Text from the document:

"As a witness, may well be taken as what amount of the object to his right. The lines of sight are probably within the range over which landing lights could appear distant objects.

If that is true, then the later views could not have involved Venus, for Venus's testimony tends to show that Venus never left the visible (or was temporarily obscured) prior to the sudden disappearance. On the other hand, it is noted that all of the views except the first two (are correlated, and) were in fact views of Venus, since one with the views shown here was in fact Venus, which is no longer exists in the sense.

It should be mentioned that the witness says he did see Venus some time as he saw the first object; Venus, he says, was higher and slightly to the south. We are very sure that Venus does not look like what they saw. How, subject of Venus had been brought up prior to this investigation, it would be difficult to determine exactly what it was that Venus.

According to ephemeris-based calculations, Venus should about one degree north of west at 8:45 PM, EST. At 8:20, it would have been 12/3 degrees above the horizon, and about three degrees below the first saw an object. Unless the additions to an observer capable of seeing within 1.5 degree of the horizon, Venus should have been visible the horizon."
