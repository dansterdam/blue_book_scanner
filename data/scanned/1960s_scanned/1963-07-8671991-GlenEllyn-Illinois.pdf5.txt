Dear Sirs,
What I am about to tell you is very, very important. First I wrote to the National Aeronautics and Administration in Houston Texas. They said I could write to Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Then they referred my letter to the SAO (Smithsonian) Observatory Cambridge Mass. Finally they said I could write to you, so here I am. On July 1, 1963 the altitude (used a theodolite) was 29 degrees and the azimuth was 240 degrees. It was round to the naked eye and was moving very slowly. I had an aurora - The time was 10:00 to 11:00 then it was going down to the horizon slowly. It was also bright. Could you tell me what this is?
Sincerely,
SMC
