Gentlemen:  
Since reading an article on you in a local newspaper, I have been thinking that I should write to you.  
There seem's to be a more and more frequent occurrence in this part of the country of sightings of lights in the sky that appear to be traveling at a tremendous speed and altitude. Some of the sightings reported to me seem most unmistakable.  
I own a radio station and my tower is just outside the city limits. On a rather clear night, I have observed what appears to be a light traveling at great speed and altitude. It appeared to change color from a steady light to one that seemed to pulsate. This occurred on several occasions; in fact, the last one was just a few weeks ago. The object observed had no sound and was only visible for a very short period of time.  
As a result of these occurrences, I am wondering if you would be interested in any information I could furnish you. If so, I would be most happy to cooperate with you in any way that I can.  

Sincerely yours,
