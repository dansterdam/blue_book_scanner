The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains two grainy, low-quality images that do not appear to depict any clear or discernible objects. The images seem to show a hazy landscape or horizon, with some indistinct shapes or markings. The text at the bottom of the page indicates that this is from the "Foreign Technology Division RTPC" and is marked as "UNCLASSIFIED".
