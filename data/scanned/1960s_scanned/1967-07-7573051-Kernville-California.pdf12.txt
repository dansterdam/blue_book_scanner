TPPT (UFO) Maj Quintanilla/70916/mhs/30 Jan 68
UFO Observation, 30 or 31 July 1967

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
I acknowledge the attached unidentified flying object report from Kernville, California which concerned an observation on 30 or 31 July 1967. However, this report does not mention any photograph and I did not personally observe an associated body, place, or objects at this time. If you feel that further information is required, please advise, and I will do what I can to assist.

I thank you for your assistance on this case.
