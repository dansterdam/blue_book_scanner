There are several pulsating or blinking lights on the side of the ship. about 5 feet in diameter, some of these lights appear to be circling or circling the ship. The movement or blinking of these lights seems to be controlled or regulated. These appear to be running or blinking lights. The brilliant white light bulb that was visible from the bottom, is only visible or on when the ship is in flight, not while hovering or landing. A thin ray of light appears to be coming from the center of the bottom part of the ship which resembles a searchlight or beam. At times this beam of light appears to be a reaction of the round bottom part of the ship when illuminated by both the lights on the side and bottom. We parked there for about 10 minutes, and then moved to the Cherry Hill Apts. parking lot entrance, and parked there for about 5 mins. and observed the tail or rear of the ship. we might have observed and everybody on the scene at that time noticed that the some light on the nose of the ship was made up from several curved blended, and diffusing to give the appearance to be sending. This light is also made from certain that appears to be sending these light do not blink as one would say a light blink in a sign or a distance plain sight.
