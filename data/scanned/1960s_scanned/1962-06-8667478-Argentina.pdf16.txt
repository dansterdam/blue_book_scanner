NOT AN AIRPLANE OR METEOR!

AERIAL PHENOMENON VIEWED

DEFIANCE, OHIO - A certain family on the outskirts of Defiance, Ohio reported an unusual incident to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization on May 23, 1962. The family consists of the parents and their three children. The father, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force, his wife, and their three children (two boys and one girl) observed an unidentified aerial object on the evening of May 20, 1962.

The object was first observed by the daughter, who was outside by herself. She called the rest of the family and they all went outside to observe the object. The object was described as being cigar-shaped and hovering low over a road near their home. The object was glowing with a brilliant light, which was not constant but varied in intensity. After about 5 minutes, the object moved rapidly away, changing to a brilliant white light before disappearing. The object was observed for about 10 minutes.

The investigating agency sent an official to interview the family, and he reported that they were obviously sincere in their report and that they clearly described what they had observed. The father was interviewed by officials from the nearby Defiance College, and his report was found to be consistent with the information given to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization.

This incident is one of the many that have been reported to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, which is a non-profit organization chartered in Washington, D.C. and composed of scientists and other qualified personnel who investigate reports of unidentified aerial objects.
