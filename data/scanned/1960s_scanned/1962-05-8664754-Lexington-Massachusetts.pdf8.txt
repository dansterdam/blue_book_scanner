There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). 

The text on the page appears to be a handwritten response to a questionnaire, and it discusses a sighting of a "white, cigar-shaped object" that was observed on the night of October 12, 1958. The text provides details about the sighting, including the object's movement and behavior.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

"Witness saw a white, cigar-shaped object over Route 128 on Oct. 12, 1958. Object was about 400 feet long and about 100 feet wide. It was moving silently and slowly in a northerly direction. The object had no wings or tail, and no visible means of propulsion. It appeared to be approximately 1,000 feet above the ground. The witness observed the object for about 10 minutes before it disappeared from sight. The witness was with others at the time of the sighting, and they also observed the object."
