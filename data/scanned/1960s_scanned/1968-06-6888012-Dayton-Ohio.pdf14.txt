DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES JUNE 3-9, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the Weekly Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Map. They include the surface weather map, the 500-millibar Chart, the Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart, and the Daily Pressure Chart. All of the charts for one day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are copied from original operational weather analyses prepared by the National Meteorological Center, Weather Bureau.

The surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The 500-millibar Chart presents the height contours and the temperature patterns of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown in feet above sea level. The temperature patterns, together with the dashed lines, are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredths of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.
