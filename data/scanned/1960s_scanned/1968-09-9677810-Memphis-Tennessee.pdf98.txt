MEMO FOR THE RECORD
25 September 1963

AM-FM radio (portable) very high pitch sound out of radio. That was turned off and not plugged in. Got in friend's car and could hear the same sound when his radio turned on. Got to apartment's inside so driver could hear sound. Outside nothing. Got in car and could hear sound, left car. Ben's volkswagon bus, opened door and you could hear it, look away and couldn't. Went inside again and one speaker from her AM-FM stereo component made the sound. Note: Observer says she has a slight hearing problem.
