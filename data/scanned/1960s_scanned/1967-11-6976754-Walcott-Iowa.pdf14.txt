The image contains two illustrations. The larger illustration is a compass rose diagram showing directions with an "X" marked at the center to indicate the position of the observed phenomenon. The smaller illustration on the right shows a silhouetted figure on a road or path with a glowing or illuminated object in the sky above.

6A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. WRITE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE APPEARANCE AND MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON.
