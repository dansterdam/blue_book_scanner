Dear Sir,
On Monday evening, May 30th, about 8:20 pm, I saw or rather observed a bright light in the sky. It had no sound to it and it was traveling east. It wasn't a minute later that another object bigger than the first, came along and seemed to be chasing the smaller one. They seemed to be moving very fast and suddenly the smaller one seemed to vanish or disappear. It seemed to be about 1000 ft off the ground with red and white flashing lights. It was traveling about 100 miles an hour roughly, similar to a jet but wasn't quite as loud. It was a clear moonlight night. I haven't seen anything like it before.
