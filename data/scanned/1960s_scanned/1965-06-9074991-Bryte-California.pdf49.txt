The image contains a black and white photograph of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified flying object. The object is depicted as an oval shape with dark shading. The text accompanying the image asks "What Is It?" and suggests that there is no price for identifying the object, as it may be one of the flying saucers that have been reported.

Text in the document:

There's no price for identifying it, but this could be one of the flying saucers we've been reading so much about. The editor of the Merced Sun-Star "he said if its one of those flying saucers hes got it right here". This appears to be a very strange picture they came across. Could it be one of the flying saucers that have been reported?
