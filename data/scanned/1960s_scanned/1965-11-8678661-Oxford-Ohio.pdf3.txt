Dear Sir:

Oxford, Ohio. Last Friday, I spotted three reddish-white objects over Oxford, Ohio. I contacted the control center and wondered whether or not you might have them on your radar. A full report of this event is given on the opposite side of this letter. I would really appreciate if you would apply whatever data you have concerning this sighting.

They were spotted between the 5th, 7:45 to 7:50 p.m. of this year, 1965.

Sincerely,
