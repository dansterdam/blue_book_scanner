There is no photograph or image present in this document. The provided text appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, describing an unidentified aerial phenomenon observed in Cora, Wyoming.

Very shortly after the first object disappeared over the ranch property, a second object was observed moving further to the East about five ground miles down the canyon. This second object was more brilliantly illuminated than the first and appeared to be about twice the width of the object and surrounded the object on all sides. The object remained motionless for a period of time, then it moved slowly for any known aircraft, and very steadily across the sky. The light was not unlike that of the first object, although somewhat brighter. The light of the second object was not steady but appeared to pulsate or flash. There was no trail or exhaust visible. The total time of sighting was one to two minutes, and the second object disappeared over the hills. There was no sound. Attention was drawn to the objects because of their lights.

Observers reported the first object to be below the highest point of elevation and 10,000 to 12,000 feet in range. The second object was not the color or shape of any star and the observers are convinced that it was man-made (but could not be determined as an aircraft). They realize the brightness and silhouette of the first object could have caused the distortion of the second. To transverse the area, the observers expressed the fact that the time of day could have prohibited identification of the object and that the altitude was so high that the object was not visible the following morning. There is no record of any unusual aerial phenomena in the area.
