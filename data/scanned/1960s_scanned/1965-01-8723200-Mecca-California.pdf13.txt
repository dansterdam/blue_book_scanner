RD CASE INFORMATION ONLY, 31 JAN UARY 1965, ITALY

Dear Mr.____,

Thank you very much for your recent letter regarding unidentified flying objects. I will be pleased to provide you with any information we have on this subject.

I am enclosing a copy of the current report on Project Blue Book, the AF's official investigation of the UFO problem. This report contains a summary of AF activities in this area and includes the conclusions reached based on over 12,000 reports of unidentified flying objects investigated during the past 18 years.

In 16 years of investigating over 9,000 reports of unidentified flying objects, the Air Force has never received any evidence that unidentified flying objects represent a threat to our national security. The UFO reports do not indicate advanced technology or devises beyond our present scientific knowledge.

There has never been any evidence that UFO's reported to the Air Force represent anything more than misidentification of conventional objects. We can detect no indication of a threat to the security of the United States or any evidence that the phenomena represent technological developments or scientific principles beyond our current knowledge.

Entries in the summaries of investigated UFO reports, it is often necessary to limit descriptive information, since some witnesses wish to remain anonymous. I trust the enclosed data will be of assistance to you.

I am in touch with the Assistant Air Attache from Italy. He indicates that you contact officers at the following address:

Ministero della Difesa Aeronautica
Ufficio Generale Armament!
Viale dell'Universita, 4
Rome, Italy

Sincerely,
