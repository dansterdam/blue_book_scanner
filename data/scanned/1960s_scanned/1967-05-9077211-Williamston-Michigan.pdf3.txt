Proposed reply to letter from [redacted], 9 May 1967

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This replies to your recent correspondence concerning a substance found near your home on May 4, 1967. The material was identified as "radar chaff". This material is dropped by military aircraft in the vicinity of a radar station. This is done to confuse the radar operators so that the aircraft can penetrate the radar defense. There must have been one of these radar exercises in your area.

We wish to thank you for submitting the material to the Air Force for analysis.

T. Sefanies / JAN 67
