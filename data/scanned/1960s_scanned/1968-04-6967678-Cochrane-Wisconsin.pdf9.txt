REPT (USO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/mis/5 Jun 63
UFO Observation, 3 April 1963

Winona Municipal Airport
Winona, Minnesota 55987

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from four miles south of Cochrane, Wisconsin. The observation occurred on 3 April 1963 at 9:15 pm CDT.

2. The observer stated that she saw a large orange boomerang-shaped object that seemed to be surrounded by smoke or fog. The object hovered over her car and her lights and radio went dead. The observer is reported to have been visible for several minutes but is was impossible to determine how long the object was in view.

3. Request information on whether you had any aircraft landing or departing your airfield (particularly a military aircraft) at the approximate time of the observation. Did anyone in the control tower see anything? We will appreciate whatever assistance you can provide. Since checking aircraft records is difficult, but we would appreciate any assistance you can provide.

4. Thank you for your assistance on this matter.
