UAO LANDING IN NEW MEXICO
The Southwest Flap
We are deeply indebted to many people for the information which comprises the following report. We would like to name them so that the members would know the kind of teamwork which made the following report possible:
Ayram Brue, Alamogordo Daily News; Terry Gross, KALG Radio, Alamogordo; Kent Mecey, Las Cruces Sun News, Las Cruces, New Mexico; Police, as well as numerous contacts who prefer that their identities remain unknown. 
This report will consist of the facts of the Zamora sighting, which brought the UFO into sharp focus in the latter part of April, and the day-by-day, blow-by-blow account of the entire investigation as it developed.
As interesting as the sightings themselves are, the ways, as the sightings themselves.
At 5:50 p.m. on Friday evening, 24 April 1964, Lonnie Zamora, a policeman of the Socorro, New Mexico City Police, was proceeding south at high speed on South Park Street in pursuit of a speeding car. As he drew abreast of the Church of the Good Shepherd, his attention was attracted by a loud roaring sound and out of the corner of his eye, to the southwest, he saw a flame which disappeared down to the southwest. As policemen often must, he thought quickly, made his decision and steered his car off into the gullies southwest of town. He felt he knew the speeding motorist anyway, and his first impression of the near and the flame was that it was "feeling around in there," referring to the dynamite shack which was located in the general direction of the blue flame he had seen.
At this point, and for only a few seconds (See Landing--Page 3)
