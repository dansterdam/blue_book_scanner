"We were out in the back that afternoon, I was sitting pondering out having someone come and see what I had saw, cause I thought I'd never have the chance to see it again. I showed my wife and she said it didn't look right to her, it just seemed awfully strange and unnatural, and unusual in size and shape. The head noise was very low volume but strang(e) sounded like a rumble or roar. I got to wondering if it might be a sonic boom from the missiles at Fort Monmouth, but it seemed too low for that. We saw it for only a few seconds, but I think we both realized at the time that it was not a conventional aircraft of any kind that we had seen before. Actually, I had seen jets taking off and coming in from McGuire AFB many times, and this definitely was not like the jets I had seen.

"A light appeared in the sky suspended in one place, no sound, after that first incident + since, I was hoping to see it again sometime, but have not. Actually we both saw this thing, and I was really wondering what it was or could be."
