Commanding Officer
Project Blue Book
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir,

This letter concerns my sighting and investigation of an unusual object seen on Saturday, 29 May 1965, in the vicinity of Glencoe, Minnesota.

On that date, at approximately 8:50 p.m., I received a call from [redacted], a local resident, reporting that he had sighted an unusual object in the sky. I immediately proceeded to the reported location, arriving within 5 minutes.

Upon arrival, I observed a large, domed, metallic object hovering at an estimated altitude of 500 to 700 feet above the ground. The object was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter and had a reddish-orange glow emanating from the underside. After hovering for perhaps 20 seconds, the object suddenly accelerated and climbed at a very rapid rate, disappearing from sight within a few seconds.

I continued to search the area but was unable to locate the object again. There were no other witnesses besides [redacted], who remained on the scene with me until the object had departed.

I am forwarding this report for your information and any further investigation you deem appropriate.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
Commanding Officer
