Evaluation of Source Reliability - Unreliable

Analysis and Conclusions: It is highly probable that these witnesses observed an aircraft under unusual atmospheric conditions. The rapid, erratic, hovering flight characteristics are typical of jet aircraft under special conditions. The variations in brightness and lighting effects are probably due to the attitudes of the aircraft reflecting the sun's rays, and the associated refracting of light by the atmosphere.
