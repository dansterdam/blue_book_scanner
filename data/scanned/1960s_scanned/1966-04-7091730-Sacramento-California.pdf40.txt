SOMEWHERE A KRYPTON?

DID SUPERSPACESMEN VISIT EARTH ONCE?

(By United Press International)

A GALAXY IC 10 - This photo taken near Hale Observatory shows a vast swarm of stars in the distant universe which may harbor intelligent life. Scientists of many countries are now deducing that such life probably exists on at least some of the billions of stars in the myriad galaxies outside our own. If so, it seems possible that travelers from other star systems actually may have visited our earth at some time in the distant past, perhaps even in our own times. The band of far-ranging "superspacesmen" as some call them, could have done so, unseen by all but a few, and left again without a trace.
