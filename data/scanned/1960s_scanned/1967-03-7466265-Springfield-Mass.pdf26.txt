I was driving near Enfield, Mass. with my Brother John. We noticed an object in the sky which appeared to be about 8 ft. in diameter and shaped like a platter and hovered a few hundred feet in the air. The object moved rapidly from left to right, then up and down and then disappeared. It made no sound at all. We estimate we observed this object for about 1 minute.
