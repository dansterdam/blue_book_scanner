The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text.

IT WOULD PLEASE ME IMMENSELY IF YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME SORT OF AN EXPLANATION IN THIS MATTER. IN ADDITION, IF THERE IS EVER ANY POSSIBILITY FOR ANY POSITION IN EITHER YOUR OR GOVERNMENT,  OR ANOTHER SUCH OUTPUT, WILL YOU KINDLY CONSIDER ME AS A POTENTIAL? I THINK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE DO NOT CONSIDER THIS LAST REMARK THE WORKS OF A CRANK. 

YOURS TRULY,
AGE: 30 YEARS
MARRIED - TWO CHILDREN 
PART TIME MUSICIAN

P.S. I COMPLETELY FORGOT TO MENTION THAT I READ THE ARTICLE WRITTEN BY RICHARD LEWIS - SPECIAL TO THE LONG ISLAND PRESS FROM THE CHICAGO SUN-TIMES, ON MARCH 17, 1965. A LITTLE TOO EXCITED I GUESS.
