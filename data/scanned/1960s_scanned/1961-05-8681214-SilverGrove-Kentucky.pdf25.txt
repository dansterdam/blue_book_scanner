The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that contains a series of questions for the observer. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes. It went out of sight behind some trees, but it did not seem to go up or down or anything, just went out of sight.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
A bright light on a straight line, about as bright as a star, like an airliner light on a straight line above you.
