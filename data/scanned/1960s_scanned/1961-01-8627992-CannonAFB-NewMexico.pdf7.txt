PAGE TWO RJWFBH 22A
INTERROGATION OF THE SECOND WITNESS REVEAL-
ED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME INFORMATION REPORTED BY THE FIRST WIT-
NESS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE OBJECT'S COLOR. THE SECOND
WITNESS DESCRIBED OBJECT'S COLOR FIRST AS PINK, THEN TURNING A
BRIGHT RED. THE THIRD PERSON IN THE CAR REQUIRED GLASSES TO
SEE, BUT WAS NOT WEARING THEM AND DID NOT OBSERVE THE OBJECT.
A COMPLETE REPORT OF THE SECOND WITNESS INTERROGATION WILL BE
FORWARDED UPON RECEIPT, HOWEVER, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR
TWO OBSERVATIONS WAS ON THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT.
