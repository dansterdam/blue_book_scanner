Dear Dr Olivier,

We have received a report of a sighting of a satellite or an unidentified flying object on 25 March 1965 at approximately 2325 hours, mountain standard time, Virginia with the following details:

When he saw a white light, which began to grow until it reached an intensity slightly brighter than the brightest star. Its size was slightly larger than the largest visible star. It was located in a stationary position and seemed to be revolving. After it reached its brightest, the object began to move upward emitting a trail of smoke which lasted for about thirty seconds, then the light went out. The smoke trail was about 300 mile long. The trail remained visible until destroyed by the wind.

This is all the information which we have regarding this particular observation. It is forwarded to you because of the unusual duration and the possibilities that this observation is associated with re-entry of space debris since four objects were observed to re-enter the atmosphere on 27 - 28 February 1965.

Sincerely,

ROBERT B. HIPPLE, JR.
