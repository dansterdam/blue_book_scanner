The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Our office maintains satellite schedules for the Air Force and would appreciate greatly if we could over Seattle on 30 July 1965 at 11:37 p.m. However, it was decided that the city was not visible at that time.

We are attaching a list of satellites and space objects visible in Seattle or locations which were visible as of 1 July 1965. This list, of course, increased due to more satellites or smaller which you reported is indeed similar to satellite observations.

Sincerely,
JOHN P. SPAULDING 
Lt. Col., Civil Branch
147th Civil Engineers Division
