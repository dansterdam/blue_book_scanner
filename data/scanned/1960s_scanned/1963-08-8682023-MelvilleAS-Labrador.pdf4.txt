The handwritten text on the image reads as follows:

"From report of Melville A. S. 
Labrador - August 8, 1963

Unidentified flying object was observed just off shore and moved over the water. It was oval in shape, glowing with a bluish-white light. It hovered for several minutes and then accelerated rapidly disappearing into the distance. The object was under intelligent control as it made abrupt changes in direction and speed."
