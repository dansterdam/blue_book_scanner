There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

Diving from Atrium, N.Y. to E. Avon, N.Y. on (BLOT) 8-2-70. At about 3:15 to 3:30 P.M. I noticed a strange object in the clear blue sky. At first I thought is was an airplane but as I watched it, it made no noise and was traveling much faster than any plane I have ever seen. It would dart up, down, and across the sky. It was silvery in color and was about the size of a large automobile. There was no smoke or exhaust visible. It appeared to be metallic and was reflecting the sunlight. I watched it for about 3 - 4 minutes before it disappeared from sight. There was no traffic on the road at the time and no one else around to see it. I have seen a UFO before and I felt that what I saw was definately a UFO. I felt that the family that I have seen a UFO before and we all called what we saw a helicopter, but I don't think that is true. On my mind I have no permanent impression, but very frasile explainable.
