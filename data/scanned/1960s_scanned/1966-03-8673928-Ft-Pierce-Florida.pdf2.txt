This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a letter describing a UFO sighting and mentioning the Project Blue Book Brochure and Dr. Carl Sagan's paper on UFOs.

The text in the document is as follows:

FT PIERCE FU ~~~E S;~.o~WA?n~R~ .

Fort Pierce, Florida 33450

Dear Sir,

Your letter explaining what you saw is very sketchy and impossible to explain because too many details are missing. Please fill out the attached form and return it to us for further investigation.

Also attached are the Project Blue Book Brochure, Dr. Carl Sagan's paper on UFOs, and a few summaries which have been forwarded to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

LEONARD 5. STRINGFIELD
Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
