The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, specifically the Seattle Post-Intelligencer newspaper dated July 6, 1970.

The text in the document reads:

UFO MYSTERY
Leslie R. Johnstone
Chased by Plane
SEATTLE
Post-Intelligencer
THE VOICE OF THE NORTHWEST
July 6, 1970

"It's the kind of thing that just isn't supposed to happen. The crew said the turrets got a "light" on and they figured it wasn't an ordinary plane."

"BESIDES THE FAA, the Coast Guard, Air Force and the intelligence section of the FBI are all trying to unravel the mystery. They've been asking locals about any unusual sightings or landings around the time the incident occurred."

"WHAT WERE EMPHATICALLY within the vision of the crew, however, were two unidentified flying objects, elongated in shape and brilliant in color, one of which was reported to have disappeared 'right in front of our eyes.'"
