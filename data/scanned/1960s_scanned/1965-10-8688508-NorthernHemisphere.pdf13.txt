The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page of text from an old UFO report document. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text found in the document:

The motion of Comet Halley's was observed in high contrast upon the sky. The comet was reported to be 3,200 feet high. The tail appeared to be about 1,000 feet long. There were various estimated reported on the position and brightness of the comet, which differed according to the location and time. Some observers reported seeing these pictures at night. Hynek stated that the brightness of the comet was a significant new finding and that further observations should be made. 

The Great Comet of 1965
Brian G. Marsden, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

On the morning of Friday, October 29th, a very bright comet appeared in the eastern sky, rising only a little before sunrise. It was discovered in independent observations by several people - primarily observers in South Africa and Russia. The comet soon became a striking naked-eye object, and by the afternoon of October 30th, was a familiar sight to most of the general public as it rose higher in the sky. Reports soon began to come in of measurements of the comet's position and apparent diameter. 

Various aspects of the comet's nature and behavior were the subject of much discussion and controversy. Even the official designation of the comet was debated for a while. Some argued that it should be called "Comet 1965f" or "Comet Burnham" rather than simply "the Great Comet of 1965." It was also suggested that the comet might be the return of Comet Halley, but this idea was soon dismissed.
