The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, rather than a photograph. The sketch shows a curved shape labeled "Question" and a smaller shape labeled "Garage" below it. There is also a blacked-out or redacted area at the bottom of the image.

As an OCR system, I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

Question
Box 39
Garage
