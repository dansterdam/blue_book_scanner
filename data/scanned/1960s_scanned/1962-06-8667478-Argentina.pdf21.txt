New Space Riddle
MARCH,APRIL,MAY, '62. SPACEMEN GALORE. Watcher on the Threshold" --------"After the Wave -- a Dark Silence"
(Condensed from the FLYING SAUCER REVIEW)
"Something new and strange has been happening. Through the fog of controversy and confusion, a new pattern of UFO reports appears to be emerging. We seem to be on the threshold of a new phase in the UFO phenomenon. 
Flying saucer activity during the months of March, April and May, 1962, was on a scale unprecedented in recent years. The number and variety of reports from all parts of the world suggest that we may be witnessing the beginnings of a new "wave" of UFO activity.
In the midst of this new upsurge, however, there has been a curious silence from certain quarters where the phenomenon has been most persistently observed and studied. The official observatory at Moonheim, West Germany, which has for years been a major source of sighting reports and photographs, has suddenly gone silent.
