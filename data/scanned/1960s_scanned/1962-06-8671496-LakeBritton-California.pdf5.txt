We made the remark that a "bat missed", this time. Next the "bat" did not move "over toward the eastern 'side' or north"....a sharp pass "on a collision course" it seemed. The "bat" did little where it was seen floating in place for a good moment....then all variable shapes swayed about until 1:30...this was twelve o'clock, with more stars "their" or more? than I could see.
My only guess is, that the "bat" was a "prime" that we now know as (accent to vanish as they got between) as and the sun  would have an estimate how high this would have?  Two years ago a young friend was staying with us here and at that time - we all saw what we still "call" and it seemed to come from north...we went to see Pacific and suddenly yelled out that, "MORE shot the others!" This but did see the great increase in light. It is at night.
Another thing we, or I , at least, have noticed. An odd rather a vibration that one seems to FEEL when what we the invisible who seeming was feeling over.  I have good reasons, this surely is no common thing (has a most beautiful sight) a "satellite" supposed to "hunt"?? Last time I saw this the 10th of June.  I thought I heard the "tone" again. May we have information?
