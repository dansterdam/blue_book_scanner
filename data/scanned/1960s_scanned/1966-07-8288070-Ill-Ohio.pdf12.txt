AMERICAN FIREBALL REPORT
MAY
The color of the fireball was a bluish color, as observed most of the time of its flight, when lower in the atmosphere. It seemed to have a bluish corona around it, but during the last part of its duration the color brightened considerably. The brightness was much greater than the full moon. 
The path of the fireball was such that it descended toward the northwest at an angle of possibly 30 degrees or more from the horizontal. Using the average of 38 estimates, its total duration was about 3 to 5 seconds. This type of observation is somewhat unusual and not normally encountered, although there are quite a number of reports which seem more accurate as to magnitude as seen from Chicago would have been about magnitude -7, possibly brighter. The distance from Chicago would have been approximately 250 miles. Fireball reports which seem more accurate as to magnitude and duration are not uncommon, and the usual numerical data follow. An examination of them will show marked similarities to A.M.S. No. 2308, of August 16, 1956.

FIREBALL OF 1966 JULY 6 
A.M.S. No. 2302

A very bright fireball was reported on this date at approximately 10:52 p.m. E.S.T. from several locations including Illinois and Indiana. The Illinois reports must have come from near Danville as reports indicate the fireball appeared in the northwest and traveled in a southeasterly direction. No reports have as yet been received from Eastern states which would verify how far from Chicago the phenomenon was observed.
The data given here are based on a solution using the method of Jacchia and Whipple. Two given magnitudes of about -7 indicate the fireball was highly brilliant. We may assume its central magnitude was about -8 to -9. The duration of the phenomenon was quite short, the fireball appearing and disappearing within 3 to 5 seconds.
