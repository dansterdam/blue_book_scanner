The sighting was quite bizarre. It could not have been a conventional aircraft. It had no lights, made no noise, and moved in a completely erratic fashion. It was oblong in shape and seemed to be metallic in construction. Its movements defied all normal modes of flight. After a period of observation it simply disappeared from sight.
