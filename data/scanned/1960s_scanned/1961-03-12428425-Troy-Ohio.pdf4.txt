Lt. Colonel Lawrence J. Tacker
Office of the Secretary of the Air Force

Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Colonel Tacker:

This is in reply to your letter of 9 January. I am sure that you would agree that I could hardly afford the time to make a special trip from Chicago to Troy for the purpose of a noon luncheon. Even were there a very handsome honorarium, I would still hesitate taking that much time from my professional life for these public relations purposes. However, should it so happen that Major Friend calls me for consultation on one of these dates, and if this requested talk were considered a part of my consulting services, I would be happy to be of service.

As I recollect, Troy is not too far from the base and if transportation could be supplied from the base to Troy and back again I would be happy to be of service to you and to the Rotarians.

I am sure that you understand my position; I simply could not justify in my own conscience spending that much time solely for the purpose of giving a popular talk.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek

P.S. Apologize for the lateness. I have been away quite a while and only recently took up the correspondence. H.M.
