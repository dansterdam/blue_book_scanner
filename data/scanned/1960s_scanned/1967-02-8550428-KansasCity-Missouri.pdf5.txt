DEPT/UFO
UFO Observation, 1 February 1967

Mr. —————, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64131

Dear Mr. —————:

Reference your correspondence of March 2A, 1967 regarding your sighting of an unidentified flying object.

I wish to personally thank you for contacting this office in regard to your observation. It was very concerned because I know you are not the only individual who has viewed a normal phenomena under unusual conditions and at first believed it to be an unidentified flying object. Again, many thanks for the note.

Sincerely,
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
