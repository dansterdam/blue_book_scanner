Salt Lake City Center would have a good idea as to your past project and aircraft flight. This was about 40 mi. South of us
reported first to Salt Lake Center. This strange object appeared at 2030 o'clock posit on and moved to 2130 o'clock
position where we lost sight of it. It did not reappear. The plane - didn't seem to gain on it - it had a much higher
altitude.  

It has been almost a month since sighting it - believe that I saw an air traffic control contacts, on the
pilots them selves - were to have these fears on hand. A lot more accurate report could be given.
