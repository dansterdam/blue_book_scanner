The text in the document is as follows:

This is in reply to your letters of 10 Sep and 24 Oct 64. We hope that we can give you a satisfactory explanation regarding the sighting of the object to which you refer. We are sorry that we cannot comply with your request for the complete file and details with which the sighting was investigated. It has been the policy of our agency to release only the names of principal witnesses. I am sure you will understand our reasons for not releasing these.

The statistics provided yearly, contain all of the information that can be given on the statistics. The last release on the evaluation of UFOs for the first half of 1964, was mailed to you on 2 Oct 64. In this release I noted that "UFO EVIDENCE" I made that the Stanford films were commented on as photo case #31, 18 Sep 56 and Project Bluebook, File #1382 indicated they were not accepted as genuine films and are considered as dubious. The attached letter from Dr. Hynek indicates that the opinion of the Camera Consultant, a project staff member, is that this film "since the location was committed by NICAP in their publication."

Regarding your question about a training film at Lackland AFB, on the subject of UFOs, we have no knowledge of the existence of such a film. Should you desire further information it is suggested that you contact the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force.

The sighting from Ulysses, Kansas, 11 Sep 64, presented certain conditions which would indicate that the object was something like a satellite.
