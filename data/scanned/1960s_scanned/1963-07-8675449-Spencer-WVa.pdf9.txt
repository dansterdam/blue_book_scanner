There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a textual description of a UFO sighting.

On July 4, at 8:30 a.m., Mr. and Mrs. Robert Carr of Waymnouth reported seeing "a dark object" emitting an orange glow and moving in an irregular path above the Archbishop Williams High School. The observers could not see how big it was, but there was a strong orange glow at the bottom. It was fully light, about 8:30. The object was visible for several minutes before it disappeared behind some trees and houses. The most pronounced detail was the orange hue at the bottom and a dark surface or area at its top, the report states.
