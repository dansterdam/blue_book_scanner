Dear sir,
This report refers to the case of August 5, 1957. on that day a Mrs. June Miller and one or those "saucer patrol" sighting wings were seen down at Lubbock. that occurred on December 12, 1957 at a little past 7:30 P.M. I was watching television. suddenly what seemed to be a jet passing over my house. it was so bright and so fast that at first I thought it was just a jet, but I then noticed it seemed to remain stationary over my house. I thought it was a planet, but it seemed to be over the house and suddenly the lights on the south porch and in the house went out. I looked all around and could see the darned thing to the southwest. I noticed it seemed to be maneuvering. all of a sudden the lights came back on and the thing disappeared. the next day I heard about the sighting at Lubbock and I know about it. if you can tell me about what this could have been, I would appreciate it.
