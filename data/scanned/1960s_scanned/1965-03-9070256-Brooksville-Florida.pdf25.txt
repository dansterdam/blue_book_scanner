UFO Sighting, Brooksville, Florida 2 Mar 65
23 Mar 65

TO: USAF SAFOI-CC (HAF RUNT)
Wash D C 20330

SUBJECT: Investigation by Dr. C.V. Boemer, of
the alleged Brooksville Flying Saucer Sighting. As you can see, 
the above-stated investigation has confirmed in the negative. 
Boemer's report further confirms my suspicions about this whole 
matter. I see no reason for this further pursuit to justify the preser
vation of this case.

1. In agree with Colonel Manitz's recommendation with regards
to the standard consultant fee. If you can come up with the money, 
please communicate directly with Colonel Manitz and give him 
the appropriations number which he should use.
