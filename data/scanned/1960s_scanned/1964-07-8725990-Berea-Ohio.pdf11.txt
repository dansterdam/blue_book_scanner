The image appears to contain two illustrations or diagrams. The first diagram shows the path and trajectory of an object, with angular measurements from 0 to 90 degrees. The second diagram appears to be a compass or radar-like diagram with rays emanating from a central point.

28. The following sketch indicates that you are at the point shown. The high object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Please make a "X" on the curve where a "X" on the compass shows where you first saw the object. Place a "T" on the compass where you last saw the object.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
