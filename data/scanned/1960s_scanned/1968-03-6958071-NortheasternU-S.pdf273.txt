Gentlemen:

I have what appears to be of considerable importance to the U.S. and to any government which is interested in sightings of unidentified aerial objects. 

On the night of March 3, 1968, a young couple, the Lewinskys, observed an object in the sky which they stated was approximately 315 meters in length and about 60 meters in height. It appeared to be a very brilliant illumination which seemed to be making an erratic flight path. At one point, it came to an apparent stop and then resumed motion. The object was observed for about 9:20 - 9:40 P.M.

While the viewing was not as scientifically detailed as would be desired, it was very clear and extended over a fairly long period of time, with the object being viewed from several angles. The observers are reliable individuals who have no tendency toward hallucination or hoaxes.

I believe this sighting may be of considerable interest and importance to your office. I would appreciate any response that you may care to make regarding the matter.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
