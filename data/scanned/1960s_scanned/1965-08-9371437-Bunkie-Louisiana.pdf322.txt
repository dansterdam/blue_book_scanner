The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

There are stepping stones along this plane. The plane goes straight up until it forks a little, then goes on to the north south. There's a circle here, which has a kind of an arrow pointing to the east. Inside the circle it looks like it says "Lights". Going around the circle, there's writing that says "They seemed to be blinking back and forth". Under the circle it says "Case No. 22".

Bubby Packard, 14, of Storm Lake, Iowa, said the object was going very fast and left a sort of trail behind it. Bubby said another neighborhood boy also saw it and they didn't laugh as much as they did at some other things.

The object was seen for about two hours that morning, disappearing and reappearing.

Mrs. McCarthy said, she had heard a loud noise that woke her and her husband up and they saw the object in the sky.
