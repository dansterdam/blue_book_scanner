Text extracted from the document:

Reference your letter concerning your unusual observation on April 3 and April 14, 1967.

The description you provided is consistent with that of a atmospheric disturbance which may have been the sighting of Venus with a stellar magnitude is by far the brightest object in the sky at this time of the year, Venus with a stellar magnitude of -4.0 being the exception, of course, of the sun and moon. There have been numerous reports for the last two months of a large, brilliant object hovering in the western sky between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Detailed investigation has revealed that Venus and a planet constellation have been responsible for these sightings. I fear this explanation is only a possibility.

Thank you for your letter and interest in the unidentified flying object (UFO) program.

Sincerely,
