I wish to relate an experience my family and I had at approximately 8:30-9:30 P.M. March 19, 1967.

We were travelling south on Gene Run Rd. The night was already dark and a cloud cover had moved over our area. Near the city limit signs of Louisville, Ky. we noticed an unusual light in the sky. This light seemed to be oscillating in different colors, that is, red, blue, green and white. The light was not steady but rather appeared to be "blinking" or flashing and seemed to cover and suggested it to be an aircraft which had landed or was preparing to land through the windshield.

The light, though unusual in color, was when suddenly appearing to be a single brilliant white light above the horizon appearing to be a star. As we drove toward the location of the light, it seemed to remain stationary. After driving about six miles toward the light, it suddenly disappeared. Later, the 2000 watt spotlight was seen no more.

The light travelled generally toward us straight course for about one minute and then passed on. We stopped at the intersection of the Gene Run Rd. from the initial sighting point.

My driver year-old son suddenly remarked something was falling from the sky. He was viewing it through the window glass. On his insistence, I looked but could not see anything unusual. The object, whatever it was, apparently passed through the light beam at a large amount of this flaming material dropping, or lumped together to the explosion or disintegration of an object.
