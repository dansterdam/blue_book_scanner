Washington, 23/6/65.

Dear Sirs,

This case was reported to me on 25, 1959. Seemingly a lighted object was observed for some time over the village of Castalia, Ohio, on the evening of 25 July, 1958, under overcast sky conditions, around 9:30 p.m. EST. The lighted object was first noticed moving rapidly from east to west at an altitude estimai to be about 2000 ft. The object appeared circular in shape with a brilliant white light. When the object reached a point overhead, it stopped, hovered briefly, then reversed its direction of travel, moving slowly from west to east and finally disappearing from sight to the east. The duration of the observation was approximately 15 minutes. 

This office has been unable to identify a conventional explanation for the lighted object observed on this occasion. The report is forwarded for your information and any comments you may care to offer.

Thank you. 

Sincerely,
