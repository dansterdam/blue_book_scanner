Flying Saucer Doubter Finally Sees the Light - in the Sky
Mrs. Ray Myler, who usually thought reports of UFOs were nonsense, sawa large, white, bright object in the sky shortly after midnight. 
She said it was hovering about a block away. It was larger than a star and quite bright. Mrs. Myler, who is still skeptical, said she had no intention of reporting the object in the sky. Mrs. Myler thinks it was probably a star or some trick of the atmosphere, but says she did see something that night. An officer called the Air Force and the officer was advised that the Air Force had picked up an unidentified object on radar which seemed to be within the area where Mrs. Myler had seen the strange light.
