The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It does not contain any photographs, only a diagram and instructions for the viewer.

The text found in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that shows how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve that shows how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass rose to show the direction from which you saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" to show the start of the path, and an "B" to show any changes in direction during the course.

Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
