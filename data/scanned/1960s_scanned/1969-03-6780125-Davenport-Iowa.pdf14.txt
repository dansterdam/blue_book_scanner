Elmer Man Sees Strange Flying Object--It Stopped His Truck
Elmer Korsgaard, 32, of Elmer, was driving his truck home from work at about 10:15 p.m. Monday, March 3, 1969, when he says he saw a strange flying object near his truck. He said the object was about 75 to 100 feet above the ground and about 75 yards to the side of the truck. Korsgaard said the object was approximately 40 to 60 feet in diameter and was brightly lighted. He said it appeared to be metallic and was moving very slowly from west to east. Korsgaard said that as the object passed over his truck, his engine stalled and he was unable to restart it. He said the object continued on its course and disappeared from sight. When the object was directly overhead, Korsgaard said he could hear a humming sound which he compared to the sound of a high tension line. After the object passed, Korsgaard was able to restart his truck and continue on his way.
