The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from a government agency to a Mrs. Hunt/man regarding an unspecified aerial object sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

Mrs Hunt/man/SAFOI cc/72942/6 Aug 65

AUG - 9 1965

Dear Mrs S

This is in reply to your letter reporting an aerial object which you observed on 6 July 1965 at 10:40 pm. The object was sighted in your skies at an elevation of 70 degrees. This is the bright planet Venus known to be quite bright in the skies at this time. Instead of being a strange sight, this is a common phenomenon which is perfectly normal in our skies. I hope this clarifies the matter for you.

Sincerely,

J.E. BLACOBLY
