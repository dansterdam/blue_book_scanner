My first sighting of the object occured in September 1951 over the municipal airport and US Air Force base in Dayton, Ohio. It was traveling at a high rate of speed in a southerly direction, and I observed it for several seconds before it disappeared from view. This sighting has been reported to the Air Force Investigative Center + Dayton Regional Rep.
Why I even have this unusual feeling and concern about the subject and events in general during the past 3 or 4 years is very hard to explain and involves some very strange personal experiences which I would rather not go into at this time.
