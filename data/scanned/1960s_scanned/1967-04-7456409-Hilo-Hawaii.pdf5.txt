The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, possibly a Project Blue Book report, with handwritten text and a signature at the bottom.

The text in the document is as follows:

achieve with candles. Wind direction, while not exactly in the same direction as the flight of the object, was in the same general direction indicated my have been in the same direction as the attitude below 5,000'.

(2) Another possibility: An ordinary weather balloon with battery powered light devices suspended below. The hull loop effect may have been caused by the suspension lines cutting into the balloon.

(3) Third possibility: A plasma of ionized air. The orange color is about the same as a low pressure sodium light. The manner in which the lights went out, however, might indicate the plasma suddenly lost its charge, equalied with a plasma phenomena. 

(4) These ideas are pure speculation and at present cannot be supported by evidence. Simply because these objects have been observed over the islands of Hawaii, Maui and Oahu the last 3 years, and in all instances they have listed as unknown since we could not find a logical explanation, they may be all insignificant according to the criteria of ATIC, however, they are seen by the public and cannot find a reasonable explanation. Some may be hoaxes all, because the local population of some of the sightings, such as the remote voleanes and water areas between some of the islands are not logical launching points.
