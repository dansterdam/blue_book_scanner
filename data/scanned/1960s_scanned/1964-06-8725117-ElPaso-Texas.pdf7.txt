2. The object was described by the witness as being lenticular in shape, metallic in appearance, and approximately 40 feet in diameter. It was observed hovering for several minutes at an altitude of about 2,000 feet.  

3. The investigation of the film was mostly negative, as stated in the report. The film could have been processed with insufficient care, and the exact nature of the object could not be determined.
