UAO Over Electrical
Power Complex
Sighted in 28 miles east of Melbourne,
Australia and was the site of a high Vo1tage power generating station at 3:35 p.m. on 12 June 1964.
While travelling on Dandenong Road
five witnesses in two cars saw a statiOnary red light 40 degrees above the horizon. On turning off onto Hallam Road
the light was still visible and the eccentric parts of the first car stopped to examine what it was.
The observers first thought the object
was a light on top of a tower but shortly
after they stopped the light accelerated
suddenly and moved off to the east. At this time the outline of the object was discernible and
one witness described the object as "like
a coin on its side" and another witness
described the object as slightly domed
on top and flat underneath. The brilliant red was at the leading edge and
was seen to be hovering the Main Transformer lines from the Morwell-Yallourn
power generating complex part. These
lines supply most of the power used in
Melbourne and other areas.
Might went on to be Mrs. Lorimer's
theory concerning UAO reconnaissance of
power supply, covered in her book, "The
Great Flying Saucer Hoax".
