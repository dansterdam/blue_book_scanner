"Flying Saucer" Reports Spread In New Mexico

SANTA FE (UPI) -- New Mexico's perennial addiction to flying saucers has taken hold of the state again with reports to police over the weekend of a latest object which, according to the Air Force and the FBI, was spotted early Saturday morning at La Madera, about 50 miles north of Santa Fe. State Police Captain Hector Barela said, "There was definitely something there."

Orlando Gallegos, of Santa Fe, told the State Police that he saw the object within 200 feet of a huge object that looked like two saucers, one on top of the other. He said it was about 40 to 45 feet in diameter, with a pole and about 14 feet in circumference. The State Police said the report did not seem to be either a hoax or a hallucination.

A similar report came from a Lonnie Moore, who said he spotted an object near Socorro, N.M. Friday evening. Moore said the object rose slowly from the ground and moved away. 

Similar reports came from Albuquerque, motorists and Air Force men driving in the La Madera area. The Albuquerque motorists, George Herrera, told the local paper, the "object was like a silver looking thing." It disappeared over a mountain in the distance.

In both the Socorro and the La Madera reports, the object were reported to have landed, approached and burned. Also found were "paw prints, like a mountain lion's" as well as landing gear impressions in the dirt. Until the recent spottings, the last unidentified flying object was spotted in New Mexico near Cline last year when a campus policeman at the University of New Mexico reported seeing a strange object flying at the same time.
