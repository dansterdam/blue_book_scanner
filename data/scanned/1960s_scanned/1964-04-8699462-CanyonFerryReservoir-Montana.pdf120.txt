Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any photograph present in the image. The image shows a handwritten letter or document from the Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.

As per your instructions, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Sept. 7 1964

Dear R. D and M. -
One the enclosed is any photograph of the UFO scene? We need the info only the matter may we're interested and would like to get the rest I may can't come from this — the information words a photograph ( 1964 ) March may, and would be helpful for an description for this coming October's meeting. We have the notice people — the 12th to the 16th 1964 almost 9.20 to 11 and on the 15th, and I have no way to travel out and trouble for service since I really do an observation for these since I cannot so an invitation now ?
