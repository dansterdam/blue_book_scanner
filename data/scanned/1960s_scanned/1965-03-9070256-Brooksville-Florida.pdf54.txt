the person had in mind, he was a medium size and
could not be convinced that there
was no person inside the craft. The craft itself was covered by dark material which covered
the hair strands. This silver material and mere
white light were present. the craft was circular, and
and very wide 3et, with a "flat area" between the two
domes. It seems like the craft stopped on its own ac-
cord. The person was astonished and scared, and
did not have the courage to make the suit or the
and craft approach closer. Close in, he did notice the foot-
prints and the strong impressions on the soil around
the craft. Around the circumstance of the stall light,
was a yellow something resembling a haemorrhoid.
Into the craft, these slats began to open
and close, and a whistling sound was heard, replacing the
other noises. when the object took off, a green vapor
was discharged and a whistling sound was heard.
The overall color of the craft was "like a nose-bubble -
somewhat like an off-white." The object then
disappeared from sight.

When the "creature" got into the craft, it seemed to
dissappear by means of a sliding motion. This is the
thing which was set side-like flaps. As the
creature shrank in weight from 7 feet to 5 feet, I
noticed that the weight of it seemed to be in proportion.
When the creature disappeared into the craft, fire
seemed to come from the cylinder, and smoke came out.
Photographs were taken, but most of it
came from sources blurred. As the telephone
news director for the Brooksville, Florida APRO member.
Some very queer and unusual attention developed during
his investigation. It was stated here at the onset, that the
sighting was a genuine sighting, and the witness,
Hessves, had technical background and seemed
to be a good observer. Various points about this case
puzzled the investigators. First, that the creature
"dissappeared" in the manner described, into
what seemed to be a "door" or "port" in the craft.
In recent sightings, a "pointed chine" has been a
in Brazil and the helmet-like covering of the hair
coincides with types identified by skilled observers. The
rest of the craft is of course, similar to
others that have been reported in the past.
When questioning Hessves, we found
a noteworthy that he saw no pockets.
