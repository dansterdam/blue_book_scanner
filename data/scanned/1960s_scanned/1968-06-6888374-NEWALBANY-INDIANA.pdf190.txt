Subj: UFO Observation, 28 June 1968

Sgt Wall saw something on the night of 28 June 1968 at 9:30-10:00 pm near Grissom, Indiana. The object had white lights and was moving approximately due north. It made no noise and passed directly overhead. Lt Marano thinks he may have observed a plane on low level, high speed bomb run originating from Standifer Field (Bomb run # 4). Lt Marano spoke with the 123 TAG Recon Group, Capt Klar. On the 28th all flights returned by 1927z. On 29th, the first plane to leave was at 0335 local time. Sgt Wall just wanted to inform the Aerial Phenomena Office that he saw something different but did not want to make a UFO report.
