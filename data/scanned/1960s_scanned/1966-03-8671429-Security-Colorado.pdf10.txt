The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a filled-out form from a Project Blue Book UFO report. 

Here is the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
* Slowly moved out of sight

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. 
If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: cloud

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of: cloud

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: slight
b. Color: green, amber, white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
[No answer provided]

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[A hand-drawn sketch is provided, showing an elongated shape with some labels.]
