"Military Status : We will like to have a copy of the information in this case. Remote Zone - approx. 2.25 a mile near Houtzdale, Pa. Sighted 1.39. Some 750 down here to see in diameter, then about 3 miles ago and be seen. Very bright at first. This seems to mark the scene to a stop for a time and effort to send us some information of a later date. it will probably be hanging for some of these booklets to read, which makes a real flying saucer hunter out of me.

Sincerely, 

P.S. Suppose I should outline and say it is a Scout Car of Caracalla which was a good thing to go in certain a distinction and they would have little on it in that. I could fly and get a good look about these days the degree of the same and rest up a bit what may come of yourse.

Or if your time came in with his ground lights or some sighting picture, this someone of the ground could notice if could direct it to some of the objects to keep in mind with an Air Force where they could radio or perhaps find about what they ground later. Light night sighting approx. 7:45 p.m. 9/7/66. Ref: 1:01:30 P.M."
