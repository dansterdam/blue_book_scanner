20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the motion, a "Y" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. Hold your hand at arm's length and measure with your fingers how much of the object is covered by the width of the match. If you had performed this experiment on the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a familiar object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object you saw.
