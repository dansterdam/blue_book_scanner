One of my sightings was February 1946. It was about 9:30 P.M. and I was standing outside observing the sky. It was a red luminous body a little larger than a first size star in the south east. It was stationary for about 5 or 10 minutes. It then started moving slowly towards the north. It kept on going toward the north. When it was in the north, it was a lot bigger and brighter. It then started getting smaller and dimmer. After a while I barely made out a faint white light in the north the USS Convoy was supposed to be. I wonder how long it had been traveling. About the time it got in the east it started pulsating. The motion was erratic or irregular. It kept on going toward the north. It kept on going toward the north. When it was in the north, it was a lot bigger and brighter. It then started getting smaller and dimmer. After a while I barely made out a faint white light in the north the USS Convoy was supposed to be. I saw it for about 15 minutes. There was no vapor trail and no sound.
If the previous one was approx. 12 miles an hour. If they were a real object. If they were a real object.
