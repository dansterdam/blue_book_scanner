There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old document containing text related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1940s and 1950s.

The text on the page discusses the lack of a specific organization responsible for investigating and evaluating UFO reports during the period from June through December 1947. It mentions that there were those within the military structure who expressed their own feelings and beliefs about what UFOs represented. The text also discusses the wide news coverage of "flying discs" or "saucers" that created sufficient concern at high military echelons to authorize the Air Material Command to conduct a preliminary investigation into these reports. The text goes on to mention a letter from the Chief of Staff on 30 December 1947, directing the establishment of a project whose purpose was to collect, collate, evaluate, and disseminate all information concerning UFO sightings and phenomena, with the responsibility for this project delegated to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, which was then part of the AMC.
