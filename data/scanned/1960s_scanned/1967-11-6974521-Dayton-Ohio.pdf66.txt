The image does not contain any photograph. It is a page from an old UFO report document that appears to be part of Project Blue Book. The page has instructions and a space for the witness to draw a picture that will show the shape of the phenomenon, including any details like wings or protrusions, and indicate exhaust or vapor trails with an arrow.

The text found in the document is:

18. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

19. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR TREE. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. HOW IS IT COMPARED TO THE OBJECT YOU OBSERVED? ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE ANGULAR WIDTH OF THE FULL MOON THE OBJECT OCCUPIED.

The text entered by the witness reads:

I don't know what I can recall as I merely caught a glimpse momentary head.
