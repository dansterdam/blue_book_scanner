The image contains a hand-drawn sketch depicting what appears to be some kind of instrumentation or dashboard display. The text above the sketch states "First Sighting: Question #1" and describes the "windows and 'landing lights' looking from beneath appeared like the sleek below. Nothing was seen in the windows which were softly lighted. The round lights were very bright and prevented seeing the main body except as blurred."

As requested, I will now perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text found in the document:
