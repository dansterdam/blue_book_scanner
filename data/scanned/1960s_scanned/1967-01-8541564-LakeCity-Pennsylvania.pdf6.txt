There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document or report describing an observation or encounter. 

The text in the document reads:

"Not estimated
The object remained in the sky for approximately 15 minutes. The moon was out, but the object did not appear to be on or near the moon, but rather in front of it. The object appeared to be high in the sky and stationary. The object looked like a small star, but was brighter. It seemed to flash or pulse slightly at regular intervals. I would say this object was 15 years old. The object looked like a small, white light and was observed for about 15 minutes before it disappeared."
