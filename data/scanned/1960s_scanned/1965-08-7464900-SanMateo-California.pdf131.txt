The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely from Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The image contains a map of Long Island, New York, as well as several lists of airports, seaplane bases, and golf and country clubs in the surrounding region. There does not appear to be any photograph present in this particular page.
