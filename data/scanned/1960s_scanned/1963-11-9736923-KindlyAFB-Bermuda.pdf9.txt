Incident 13 November 1963

Attached is an account received from the Bermuda office of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations concerning an unidentified flying object observed over Kindly Air Force Base, Bermuda, on 13 November 1963.

Apparently the object did not show on any radar screens, and the visual observations were made by several people who were present and observed the object. Since the incident apparently did not come to the attention of the authorities, and no report has been made to Project Blue Book, I am taking the liberty of submitting the account for your information.

In order to make an investigation, it is necessary that the object be observed again, and that the details be obtained from the witnesses. Perhaps you can arrange to have the matter looked into further, and advise us of the results. Any additional information or photographs that can be obtained would be most helpful and interesting.
