As he drove along, Mr. saw one car parked at the side of the highway with its parking lights on. Also, a car passed him on his right side, and the occupant of this car waved to him through his car window.

And driving home, Mr. phoned the local FAA office to report what he had seen, and he also called a local newspaper office to try to get information about the sighting. He did not succeed in getting any more information, and was told that there had indeed been several calls about a UFO sighting the previous evening, but was told that there had been no idea what caused these. 

Mr. wife was present at the interview, but she busied herself with some items, and did not appear to be a stable, well-adjusted witness. No further comments. Mr. appeared to be a stable, well-adjusted witness, and he had no difficulty in being interviewed. There were no childish, immature or a little embarrassed to be involved, but willing to cooperate provided the information would be forwarded to OFFEN and the Director, OOAMA, for appropriate action.

Although he was keenly interested in UFO's, as evidence by his contacting the FAA and local newspaper office, he felt that an investigation should not be made on the basis of his report alone. He said he is afraid of being classed in that category if his friends found out that he had reported a UFO sighting.
