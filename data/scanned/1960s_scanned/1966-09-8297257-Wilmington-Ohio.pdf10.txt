Several other persons were in this area at the time of the sighting besides myself and T-70 observer. They were also greatly impressed by the unusual objects. While it lasted only a few minutes, time enough to comment on the unusual behavior and characteristics of the objects. There were two objects which seemed to be maneuvering as if intelligently controlled, moving rapidly at times and then slowing down, hovering, and making tight turns. Color was grayish and shape oval or disk-like. Size was hard to determine but appeared to be about 10 feet in diameter. No noise or exhaust was noticed. The objects seemed to be under intelligent control and it left the impression that they were exploring this area, rather than just a natural phenomena. It would not go below the tree line and was estimated to be at 4000-5000 feet altitude. Could not be confused with any known aircraft. If you like, I would wait to wil Lwrite a more detailed description later, but this covers the essential points as I observed them.
