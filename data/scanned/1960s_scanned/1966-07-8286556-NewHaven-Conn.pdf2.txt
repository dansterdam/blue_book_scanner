DEAR SIR,

I'VE MADE A COMPLETE STUDY OF THE UFO AND I KNOW THATS SO AFTER SOME INVESTIGATION, I THINK I SHOULD REPORT WHEN SITTING ON OUR PORCH ON THE EVENING OF JULY 28, 1962 MY GRANDMOTHER, ME AND MY SISTER TO COME HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL, WHEN A STRANGE SILVERY ROUND OBJECT CAME INTO VIEW AND SEEMED TO BE COMING TOWARD OUR HOUSE (WHEN FACES SOUTH) IT WAS ABOUT 40 TO 50 FEET UP AND CAME AND LEFT FROM THE EAST TRAVELING ABOUT 5 MILES PER HOUR, AND DID NOT GLOW WE COULD SEE IT AND GOT IT IN VIEW FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS. IT WAS SILENT WAS NOT GLOWING AT ALL, THIS ALL TOOK PLACE IN ABOUT 13 MINUTES.

IT CAME FROM THE WEST
ALMOST GHOSTLY
SLOWLY SOUTHWARD
AND HEADED EAST

NEW HEADED PATH 
TO WAY VERY SLOWLY
IT SEEMED TO
COME UP 
SLOWLY 
AND STAYED

(NEXT PAGE & TIME?)

SINCERELY YOURS,
