Huntsville, Alabama
5 November 1967

Dear sirs:

It has been over a year now since I sent you the report of a UFO sighting, or rather a UAP, which I referred to it. I from time to time have wondered as to what your findings were. Surely you have had enough time.

The report which you might have misplaced (or my family) made the sighting: since then I have considered it possibly important to science findings. Please let me know carefully if you are conducting some further investigations. I have compiled file on the requirements for an engineering at U.S.D. in space engineering at Redstone Arsenal. In 1962, I was employed by Thiokol Chemical Corp. as propulsion engineer on the Pershing missile system. So you understand my interest.

Thank you for your time and waiting for your immediate reply.

Sincerely,

D-A
