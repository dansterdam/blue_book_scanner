The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the image, the output is as follows:

That which transpires last September was that approximately 6 or 7 witnesses in a remote area on the outskirts of Clarksburg, West Virginia, reportedly watched an object during the early evening hours which they described as flying in a "figure eight" course, traveling at a very high rate of speed. According to the Federa l Bureau of Investigation memorandum, after having observed the object for sometime, it apparently ascended at an extremely rapid rate, disappearing from view. Later that evening, a few of the witnesses reported that they had again observed the object, but that it seemed to reappear in a stationary position. It was also reported that the object displayed flashing lights and seemed to be roughly the size of a small airplane.

I would appreciate it if you could provide me with some additional details concerning this reported UFO sighting, as well as any other pertinent information which may be available in your official files.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours truly,
