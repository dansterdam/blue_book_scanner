Presentations are valid, then we can assume that there are planetary systems around all stars whose spectral classes are later than F2. The overwhelming majority of the stars of the galaxy satisfy this condition, i.e., the k1 factor in formula (1) must be close to unity.

Gindilis also points out that another important argument in favor of a large number of planetary systems in the galaxy results from observations of "Barnard's Flying Star." Because this star is very close to the solar system, (closest to us after Proxima and Alpha Centauri) it moves rapidly along the celestial sphere in comparison with other stars. Barnard's Flying Star is a red dwarf of the M5 spectral class with a mass of 0.15 that of the sun. Van de Kamp (American) observed that the proper motion (path across the celestial sphere) of this star has periodic oscillations caused by the presence of an invisible dark satellite. The satellite is dark because its mass is only about 1.5 times that of Jupiter and therefore cannot be self-luminous. This could be a giant planet rotating around its star along a strongly elongated orbit.

Professor B. V. Kukarkin (USSR) has noted that wobbling could also be caused by a system of several planets similar to our planetary system, provided the periods of rotation of the planets are approximately commensurate. Kukarkin suggests that the proper
