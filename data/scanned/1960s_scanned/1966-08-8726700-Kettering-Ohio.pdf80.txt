PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 67-32
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ANALYSIS
LOCATION MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA
DATE Unknown
PHOTOGRAPHY
AF: - 
IR: -
P NRS: One negative, one 4 x 5, and one 8 x 10 print
PURPOSE: This report is written in response to Work Order Number 67-13 submitted by Major General Rau regarding photographic analysis of an unidentified flying object.
ANALYSIS: The photography appears genuine insofar as content is concerned. Examination of the submitted negative discloses nothing inconsistent with the claim. Close inspection of the negative reveals many smaller images in addition to the bright image which is visible on the print. These smaller images are believed to be the path of the object as it moved through the field of view. Notation should be made of the fact that the images are located in the trailer position, an unusual frame position.
