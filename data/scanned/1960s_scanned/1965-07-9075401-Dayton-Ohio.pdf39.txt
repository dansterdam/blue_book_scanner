VILLA DO PORTO, THE AZORES, JULY 11 (AFP) - THE AZORES WEATHER BUREAU WHILE CHECKING SOME CYLINDRICAL WHITE OBJECTS AT ABOUT 3,500 FEET, AS THEY FLEW OVER VILA DO PORTO SAID THAT THEIR MOTION AND SPEED WAS SIMILAR TO THAT DESCRIBED BY PERSONNEL IN A REPORT BY THE U.S. WEATHER OFFICE SAID:

"THE OBJECTS WERE MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWARD AT ABOUT 20,000 FEET. THE WEATHER OFFICE SAID.

"LATER, ONE OF THE OBJECTS WAS SIGHTED AT ABOUT 20,000 FEET BY A PILOT OF AN AZORES AIRCRAFT COMPANY WHO SAW THE OBJECT DISAPPEAR BEHIND THE CLOUDS."

THE REPORT CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT "SINCE THERE IS NO INTERFERENCE OF ANY ELECTRICIAN WHO WAS REPAIRING THE SYSTEM, I CANNOT BE STATED THAT THE OBJECT WHICH INTERFERED ELECTRIC CLOCKS IS NOT OF CELESTIAL ORIGIN." 

A SIMILARLY DESCRIBED OBJECT WAS SIGHTED BY A COUPLE OVER NORTHERN TERCEIRAL RADA MAR, HEAD OF AN AZORES AIRCRAFT COMPANY WHO SAW THE OBJECT SUDDENLY DISAPPEAR WHICH APPEARED OF A BALLOON-LIKE SHAPE.

ON JULY 16, ANOTHER REPORT SAID LAST WEEK THAT CHILEAN BRITISH ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION PERSONNEL SAW A GLOWING OBJECT ZIP ACROSS THE SKY IN THE ANTARCTIC. THE ARGENTINE NAVY HAS APPARENTLY FIELD MEASUREMENTS THAT MEASURE MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES THAT MAY INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF METALLIC OBJECTS IN THE SKIES.
