The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch depicts an object with a disc-like shape and two visible features labeled "Exhaust Trail" and "No visible" parts. The sketch is accompanied by text that describes the observed characteristics of the UFO, such as its sound, color, and angular size.

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? IT SEEMED A COMPLETE DISAPPEARANCE VANISHING ALMOST INSTANTLY AT A FANTASTIC SPEED.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes No. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes No. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound LIKE A WHISTLING NOISE 
b. Color ALTERNATING WHITE-RED-BLUE-GREEN
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Didn't do it - couldn't observe details how ever it almost meant have covered MOST of it.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
