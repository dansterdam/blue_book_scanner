The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely part of Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate UFO sightings.

The text in the document reads:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 1 Nov 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I have the impression that I was sitting in the kitchen of my home looking out through the window. The sky was overcast with a low ceiling of clouds. Suddenly a bright, silvery,metallic object appeared in the sky above the trees out of nowhere and remained stationary for a few seconds. I pointed it out to my daughter who was also in the kitchen with me. She also saw the object. Suddenly the object accelerated and disappeared into the clouds. I considered calling the authorities at the time but decided against it for fear they would not believe me.

Lt Colonel George Freeman's letter has fascinated me for some time. I was thinking about his comments on the need to approach the question of Unidentified Flying Objects in a more serious scientific manner. I procured this questionnaire hoping that my experience, though apparently trivial, might be of some use in contributing to a better understanding of this phenomenon. However, I feel that the data it elicits would serve little purpose. Accurate recording and analyses of the many sightings which undoubtedly occur each month would be far more valuable than the sporadic and sketchy information obtained from a few selected witnesses. The resources devoted to this project would, in my opinion, be better employed in more fruitful areas of scientific research.
