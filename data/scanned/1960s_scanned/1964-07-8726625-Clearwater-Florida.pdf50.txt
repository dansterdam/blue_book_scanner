Text from the document:

This sighting was a relatively close encounter with a very bright, oblong-shaped object observed visually and through 7x50 binoculars for a duration of approximately 15 minutes. The object was first noticed at 5:50 p.m. as it moved silently and rapidly across the sky from the southwest to the northeast over the Clearwater, Florida area. It was described as being luminous, glowing white in color, about the size of a baseball held at arm's length, and elongated in shape. The sighting was investigated by two detectives from the Clearwater Police Department.
