Dear Sir,

On October 14, 1969, we received a report from one of our students over there who claims to have sighted something out of the ordinary over New York. This report was filled in on a normal sighting report form, a copy of which is enclosed.

I just wanted to give you a description for all its worth. Guy was taking a series of photographs of a gradually changing V-formation, believed to be 12 in number, irregularly arranged in a circular pattern. They were moving very slowly. The exposure time was about 15-20 seconds, and the sighting lasted nearly 1 1/2 minutes.

The temperature was about 55-60 degrees, the wind speed about 10 mph from the northwest. The sky was clear, the ground surface dry. Visibility was excellent.

It is the belief of the witness that this was not a meteor or satellite, and it is certainly quite impossible to achieve this rate of motion and configuration. The student claimed to be very capable and experienced in photography, so he is rather confident of his observations.

I would be interested to know if you have any other reports corroborating this incident, or any comments you would like to make in this connection.
