As to the people that make up these groups, a lot of them are people like you and I that are interested in this technological age of ours. I was talking to Willy Ley, the famous rocketeer, the day before yesterday and he pointed out that we have over thirty-three pieces of hardware circling the earth right now, which is a tremendous number of artifacts to be up there whirling around.   They're not all satellites, some of them are second-stage, third-stage pieces of rockets, but they're up there. And I think the public itself is getting very used to this type of thing.  That's why I prophesized in the book that the flying saucer era itself is coming to an end.

CORRICK: How do you mean that?

COLONEL TACKER: Well, I believe, really, that the flying saucer era is similar to the great accent on spiritualism which took place at the turn of the century, and I believe that the public will find some other romantic subject to become absorbed in and go on to it, rather than flying saucers. We've become used to space and it looks as though we're going to put a man into space real soon and I think this will really signify the end of the so-called saucer era.
