10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: 5 round objects, brilliant light, floating in air, wavering.
11. COMMENTS: "Lights were oblong-spherical in shape, size of basketballs, changing color from intense white to orange-red, and back again, with a pulsing or wavering characteristic of brightness. Coupled with description of motion, this tends to indicate an unusual phenomenon, but insufficient data for accurate conclusion."
