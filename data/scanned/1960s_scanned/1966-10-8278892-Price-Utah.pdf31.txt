Mr. Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

This letter is concerning unknown objects. I sighted the objects over Price, Utah. They were very bright and looked to me like I did not know if they were flying objects or something else so I thought I would write and tell you what I saw.

I took some pictures but I wish I had gotten more, as I got only two. I wanted to be sure that I had gotten something so I took two to be sure that I had gotten something. I want to be sure you could see them. I have the slides developed and could send them to you if you are interested. The shape and size was a little different and did not look like a regular plane. The lights I saw were about three of them, different size or different brightness, shaped different. The lights come over our city by different people at different times, after I have taken these slides.

If these slides would be of any help to your government in their "Project Blue Book", I have no idea what these things are, but I have a feeling I would very much like to know what they are, being sighted for the people not to know what they are.

If these slides are of interest to you, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,
