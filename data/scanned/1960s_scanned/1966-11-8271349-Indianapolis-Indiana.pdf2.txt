SAFOI

We had a phone call at about 9:10 pm from a lady who reported seeing lights in the sky. She said she was watching television when she noticed bright lights moving across the sky. She said there were 3 or 4 of them, moving in a diamond pattern. She said they were very bright and that she had never seen anything like it before. She said they seemed to be pulsating and one of them seemed to go off into the distance. She said they were about 2 or 3 miles west of her home. I advised her to contact the local police and pass on the information. She seemed quite excited and convinced that what she had seen was not an airplane or satellite. She said the lights were definitely moving in an unnatural manner. I stated that it sounded like a possible UFO sighting and that I would make a report. She agreed with that assessment.
