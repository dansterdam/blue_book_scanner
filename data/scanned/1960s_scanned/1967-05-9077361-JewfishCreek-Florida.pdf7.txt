I was called at home about 4:45 am. It was a bright clear night with stars showing so that I could see a large, dark object silhouetted against the sky. It was hovering, absolutely motionless, about 1000 feet off the ground and about a half mile away. The object appeared to be about 40-50 feet in diameter and shaped like a typical flying saucer. As I watched, a bright beam of light shot from the object down to the ground, illuminating a large area. The beam seemed to pulsate or flicker as it remained stationary on the ground for about 30 seconds. Then the light went out and the object shot straight up at a fantastic speed, disappearing into the night sky within seconds. I turned on the portable radio transmitter I had with me and called the base. After about 15 minutes, a car arrived to pick me up. I was taken to the base and thoroughly questioned about what I had seen. I could give them no further information other than what I have described here. This was the most astounding and impressive sight I have ever witnessed. I am quite certain that what I saw was not a natural phenomenon and could only have been an intelligently controlled device of some kind. I have a technical background and I am quite familiar with all types of aircraft and aerospace hardware. Whatever this object was, it was not something built by any nation on earth that I know of.
