TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT:

A shaky and irksome study was made just a few minutes before. The time was 3:50 am and my regular watch with the B-3 and my new Breitling watches were compared. I noted the time at that instant was 3:50 am EST. I mean and accurate to 1 second according to my timepieces. At that precise moment, I noticed 2-3 round objects-greyish in color and about the size of a U.S. quarter or a little larger. They were hovering in the sky at an estimated altitude of from 400 to 500 feet. I have already stated the exact time noted. These objects seemed absolutely motionless and noiseless. After hovering for 20-30 seconds. they slowly moved about 3-400 yards to the southwest of my location, again came to a complete halt and hovered silently for an additional 30 seconds or more. They then accelerated at incredible speed, said to be at least 3 to 4 times the speed of a jet aircraft, and were quickly lost from sight over the distant pine trees after traveling about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile. The color was a very light grey, almost white. They did not blink or twinkle like a star but were evenly illuminated. They cast no beam or trail of light. The night was quite dark and cloudless. I assure you my surprise and wonder, for I have never seen anything like this before and I truly do not know what to make of it. I hope some explanation can be offered and I shall await your report with great interest.
