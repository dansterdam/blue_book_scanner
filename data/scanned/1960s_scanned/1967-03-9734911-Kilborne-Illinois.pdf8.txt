The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to "Mrs. Johnson" from someone at the Department of Defense regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) being sighted in the area.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mrs. Johnson,

President Johnson has asked that I reply to your letter concerning the unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which are being sighted in your area.

Within the Department of Defense the Air Force has the responsibility of investigating UFOs reported to it and determining whether or not these objects constitute a threat to our national security. This program is carried out under the designation Project Blue Book. The enclosed brochure explains our program since its inception in 1947.

Blue Book personnel at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base inform me that they have not received any UFO reports from your area. However, March 8-10, they received many from Gladesbur, Moline, and Monmouth. These sightings were determined to be hot air balloons.

I have enclosed an AF Form 164 which is used in officially reporting a sighting to the Air Force. If you will complete this form and return it in the attached envelope, we will attempt to evaluate the sightings in your area. We are not testing "boundless planes from outer space."

I hope this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
