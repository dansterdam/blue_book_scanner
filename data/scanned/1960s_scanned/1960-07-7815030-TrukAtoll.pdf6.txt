FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
District Attorney
July 20, 1960
Report of Unidentified Flying Object
Investigation of the report of an unidentified flying object, based on the attached statement by Master Sergeant Barney I. Leyland, United States Air Force, Truk Atoll, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, on July 19, 1960, as follows:
On July 19, 1960, at approximately 7:45 a.m., Sergeant Leyland observed in the sky a bright, metallic, circular object which hovered for several minutes, then moved away at a high rate of speed. It was observed by Sergeant Leyland for approximately one minute. The object appeared to be approximately 60 feet in diameter and 15 feet thick. It was metallic in appearance with no visible means of propulsion. The object did not make any sound as it hovered and moved away.
There were no other witnesses to the sighting. Sergeant Leyland is considered reliable and intelligent, and his report is considered sincere and worthy of investigation.
It is requested that perhaps some agency of the government would be willing to investigate this matter further. If you desire any additional information, please advise.
