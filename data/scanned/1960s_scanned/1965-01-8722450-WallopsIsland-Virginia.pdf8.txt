The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

There was no interception or immediate identification action possible because the object was observed for only a short period of time.

A check was made with the Air Traffic Control Facility in the Washington Terminal Area and the Wallops Island NASA Station area. They reported no aircraft operating in the vicinity of the sighting. 

This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert R. Doriss, USAFR Staff Officer, Data Centre, ADC and reviewed and distributed by Colonel McCaffrey, Commander, 1st Fighter Interceptor Squadron.

The observer was occupied with other duties after the initial firming and therefore was unable to make a more thorough check or observation. The sighting was reported to the ATIC Commander but he felt there was no reason to conduct a more detailed investigation because no physical evidence was reported to exist.

1. No physical evidence was reported to exist.

2. The observer was occupied with other duties after the initial sighting and therefore was unable to make a more thorough check or observation.
