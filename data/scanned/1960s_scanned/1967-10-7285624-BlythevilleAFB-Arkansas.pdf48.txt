The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document describing an observation or report related to a UFO sighting.

When I act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system to extract the text from the document, the output is:

Alten I first saw the object of 08:05 p.m. the margin at about this time on the evening of 12:30 it was a bright object that most be a very high and could just be seen as a star. It appeared to move in a straight line across the sky from east to west and then it seemed to stand still for about 5 minutes. Then it began to move again in the same straight line. The object was visible for about 15 minutes. The color of the object was a reddish color and it gave off an unusual light that was different from that a star. We were operating like it was a drone and that we seen in the air about 3:30 and all the object as large steady. I believe I saw the same or a similar object about a half hour later.
