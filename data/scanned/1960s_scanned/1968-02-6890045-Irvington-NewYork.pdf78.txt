There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

LIGHTS WERE FAIRLY LARGE. 
SLIGHTLY TILTED YELLOW, ALMOST WHITE. 
LIGHTS SCENE THROUGH TREES AND OBSCURRED BY SOME CLOUDS, JUST VERY BRIGHT, 
WERE STEADY THEN DID BLINK OUT FOR A SHORT TIME, THEN CAME BACK ON. 
MOVED FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST AND SEEMED TO BE AT A CONSIDERABLE ALTITUDE. 
THEY WERE FAIRLY LOW AND SMALL THOUGH.
