Gentlemen:

Enclosed is a duplicate copy of a USGS Report, the same as the object. She is not a NICAP member, I do not see a number.

I re-visited the UFO question since 1947 and re-examined certain reports not heretofore considered, and to be sure, in my opinion, a position is possible be built up and approved that the existing official position cannot be valid, considering that the USAF, according to their information, has conceded positions of fallacious and IRAC's position that this particular object is not considered. For reasons you may send were from 22 of the magazines to my wife.

I would add that although disclosure to the public would be embarrassing the USAF, I submit a dark disclosure to the public at this time would be best for the USAF to indentify the public as promptly as possible with certainty as to what I believe to be facts, however unpleasant they may be. As a citizen, I believe that any criticism of the USAF that may result would be less disastrous than the present political situation has become deteriorated with the public. There has been too much "double talk" in the past.

Yours sincerely,
