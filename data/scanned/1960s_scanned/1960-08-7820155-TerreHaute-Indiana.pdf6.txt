35. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? Research and Education Committee
36.1 If you answered YES, did they investigate the object too? (Circle One) Yes No
36.2 Please list their names and addresses. I am unable to do so as I did not know the names and addresses of the persons to whom I reported this.

37. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this? (Circle One) Yes No
37.1 If you answered NO, when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones? By change on date 1-2-56, by change in October 1956 or 1957, I can't remember which.

38. In your opinion, what do you think the object was and what might have caused it? I do not believe that this object was a satellite or it was going in a recognizable motion. It was not like a jet and I could not tell what it was because I could not get a good look at it with my 10X binoculars. It was an unidentified flying object.
