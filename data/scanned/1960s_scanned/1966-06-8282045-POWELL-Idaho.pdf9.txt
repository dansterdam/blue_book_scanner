Text extracted from the document:

Dear Mr. Powel. - I am writing this letter to you in regards to the sighting of a strange object in the sky over the Powell area on 6 June 1966, which I witnessed. 

As I was driving from Powell to Grangeville, Idaho, at approximately 11:00 PM, I observed a bright light moving across the sky from the southeast to the northwest. The light seemed to be larger than a star and was changing colors from white to orange to blue. It was moving at a rapid rate of speed, much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. 

I continued to watch this object for several minutes as it moved across the sky. At one point, it appeared to stop and hover for a short time before continuing on its course. I did not see any definite shape or outline to the object, only the changing colored light. 

After observing this for some time, the object suddenly disappeared from view. I am at a loss to explain what I saw that night. I can assure you that I am a rational and level-headed person, and this was no illusion or misidentification of a known object.

I hope this information is of some use to you and your investigation. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
[Handwritten Signature]
