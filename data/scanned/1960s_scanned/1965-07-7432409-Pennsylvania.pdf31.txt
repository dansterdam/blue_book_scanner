PAGE 3 REVIEW OF 235 NICHOLS

(1) STEVEN R PAQUETTE, 13T LT USAF, CTS OPERATOR:
(2) COLLECTED VISUAL SIGHT ING REPORTED IN PART ONE. THE BALLOON SIGHTED VISUALLY BY INTERCEPTORS OVER CHEAT. THE SIZE, DESCRIPTION AND FLIGHT PATH APPEAR TO CORRESPOND
(3) THE RADAR TARGET IN PART TWO COULD BE THE LIGHT PLANE SIGHTED BY THE INTERCEPTORS, ALTHOUGH THIS IS ONLY A POSSIBILITY, IT WOULD LIKELY APPEAR TO HAVE SAME FLIGHT PATH AND OTHER FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS
(4) THE OBJECTS IN PART ONE AND TWO WERE NOT THE SAME AND I BELIEVE THE ABOVE CONCLUSIONS AS TO THEIR IDENTITY ARE VALID

ATTACHMENT ONE PART TWO
