UFO REPORT 
UFO SIGHTING - 8/12/65

WITNESSES: Mr. Leonard R. Mitchell 
Ms. Donald R. O'Leary
Mr. Mast Lyons, Massachusetts
Ms. Jennett Mason, Massachusetts 
Ms. Margaret Johnson, Trotwood, Ohio

DATE: 13 August 1965
PLACE: Hassen Baking Corporation, 318 Brookline Street, Lexington, Massachusetts

BACKGROUND: The witnesses stated that the object was observed by them as they arrived at the Hassen Baking Corporation. 

SIGHTING ACCOUNT: 
Donald C. O'Leary was leaving the sky church at the time the object was sighted. He observed a large silver metallic object hovering in the sky. He estimated the object to be approximately 100 feet in diameter. The object did not make any sound and appeared to be motionless. After a few minutes, the object moved swiftly to the northwest at a tremendous rate of speed.

EVALUATION: It seems that the apparent size of the object was probably exaggerated but beyond that, the details given by the witnesses appear to be generally accurate. The object was seen by multiple reliable witnesses and exhibited characteristics typical of many UFO sightings. Therefore, this sighting is considered to be of significant interest.

CONCLUSION: The object was probably a legitimate UFO, though its exact nature remains uncertain.
