Transcribed text from the document:

BLUEBOOK RAPID, 6 January 1960, 
Page 2. Col. 4,5. continued:

It was recently found that the strange lights seen, in a similar manner there, turned out to be reflections from some car lights, and that the reported lights seen, as the car came within sight, was simply the reflection of the lights, but it might be pointed out, that much more should be considered in this connection, such as the fact that these sightings were in a remote area, and that the observers had no previous indications that this kind of phenomenon might be, but they just happened to think of these sightings as an explanation.
