There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, likely part of a Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to transcribe the text found in the document:

In mid page it appears to contain details of an unidentified flying object sighting on December 19, 1954. The sighting occurred in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The report mentions a "bright, white light" that was observed by the witness. The light was described as being larger than a star and moving rapidly. The witness apparently reported the sighting to the U.S. Air Force.

The document also mentions that the witness was interviewed and provided additional details about the sighting. Overall, this appears to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report detailing the investigation of a UFO sighting in 1954 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
