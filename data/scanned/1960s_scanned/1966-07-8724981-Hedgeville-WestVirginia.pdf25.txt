Dear Sirs,

My name is James Dold and I ordered like to tell you about my experience with three that L. O'B. Ash July 25, 1966 at the east of Beaver I have an eye witness when to looked up in the sky there appeared the lake. I always travel to work in the same direction and this point I was of a class to Hedgeville, West Virginia. 

It happened 8pm. The sky was all the clear and I thought I saw a lightning bug coming toward me. I thought it was 2 Lightening-bugs but well.
