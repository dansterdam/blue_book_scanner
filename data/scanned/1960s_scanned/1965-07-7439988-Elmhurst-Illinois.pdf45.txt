SUMMARY: During the time Dr. [redacted] was relating this observation, I was impressed with his sincerity in his belief that there was "something unusual" in the object he observed. He stated he felt it was a "fool" to deny the phenomenon, and admitted he was not an expert on the things he observed in the sky.
