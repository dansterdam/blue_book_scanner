This sighting seem one of interest to me in that it was one of a duration of some 16-20 minutes. The sighting was of a disc-like object which was metallic in appearance and giving off what appeared to be a brilliant blue-white light. This light remained constant during the viewing period. The size of this object estimate to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. It was not only observed by myself but by three other persons also. The object maintained a course from west to east at an estimated altitude of 500 to 1000 feet. It did not make any sound at all. Once over the scene of the sighting it appeared to make an erratic movement, coming to a brief stop and then continuing on its course. There was no exhaust or trail of any kind associated with this object. The sighting was in clear weather with no cloud cover. Once out of sight the object did not reappear. I believe this was an unusual and interesting sighting and would appreciate any comments or suggestions you may have concerning this incident.
