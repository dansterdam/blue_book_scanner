October 2, 1965

was a to see the and other lighted objects in the sky over our house last night. At about 10:30 p.m. I observed four bright lights in the sky from my front porch. They appeared to be about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon in the West or Northwest and were moving very slowly in a southerly direction. They seemed to be at a great altitude and were approximately the same size as an aircraft, but were much brighter than any aircraft lights I have ever seen. There was no sound associated with these objects. They were visible for about 10 minutes until they disappeared behind some trees. I have notified other people who may have seen the objects, but so far have been unable to confirm any other sightings. I would appreciate your investigating this incident and advising me of your findings.
