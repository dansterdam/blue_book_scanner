The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

Dear Mr. ------,

I have received your letter of September 6th concerning an item which will shortly be forwarded to you. 

In answer to your questions: 1) We do not know where such data for the sighting you requested has been maintained. This would require the individual who earlier had received this information to determine where it has been retained.

Our position is the same as that of Dr. Lynch. We would be more anxious to see this film.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM B. COLEMAN, JR.
