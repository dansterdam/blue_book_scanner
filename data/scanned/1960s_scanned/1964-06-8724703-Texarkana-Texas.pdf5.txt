UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY, COLORADO
December 9, 1964

Dear Dr. Hynek:

As you are well aware, it would be most desirable to furnish you with any information relative to our sightings by USAF pilots or "DXGers" who do not report at the various bases. 

The time was about midnight June 5, 1964 about 10 miles S. of this base. An airman reported seeing an extremely bright light, comparable to a moon in brightness, coming from the direction of Colorado Springs and traveling in a northeasterly direction. He described its motion as a smooth, majestic, extremely fast motion, like nothing he had ever seen before. The object was visible for about 4-5 minutes.

At one point, the object appeared to move abruptly, hesitatingly, as if checking its course. The airman watched it until it disappeared from view, far off in the distance. The air traffic control tower and the operations office were notified, and the incident was reported to the Project Blue Book office at the Air Force Academy.

Any additional information you can supply regarding this sighting would be most appreciated. Likewise, any comments you may have concerning the handling of these matters would be very helpful.

Sincerely yours,
