The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a diagram or sketch showing an angular profile of an unidentified object in the sky, along with a compass rose and instructions for the viewer to fill in some information about the object's movement and placement in the sky.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the compass where the object was first sighted above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" on the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
