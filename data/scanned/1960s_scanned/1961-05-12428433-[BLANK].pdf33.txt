The image contains a photograph depicting an airship or dirigible-like aircraft. The text below the image provides a detailed description of the airship, including its size relative to a typical airplane, the expandable nature of its envelope, and the general advantages of this type of structure. There is no mention or identification of any human individuals in the image.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
In normal structures, if you get a load that is too large, the structure will collapse. In an expandable structure what happens is, instead of collapsing, the load is spread very evenly across the entire structure, and this type of structure is just as good as new. These are our advantages with this type of structure.
THE AIRSHIP STORY
The reason for showing the picture (Figure 3) of the airship, which is not necessarily the ideal type, is that we have already examined this for carrying very large payloads and find you can do this with an airship type vehicle. Another reason for showing structure. 
The size that you see underneath the airship is about the size of a good size airplane. You can see how much larger the envelope, which is expandable structure, is. It can be made much larger than usual. This type of structure usually requires very large structures, and when we talk about it is a large structure. About the first of several brief moving pictures examples of expandable structures.
