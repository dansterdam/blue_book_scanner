Dear Sir:

The night this was written I was awake listening to a program on radio. Suddenly I noticed a luminous object. I looked out the window and after a few minutes it seemed to be coming our way. It made a very bright light and was several times brighter than the largest star. It seemed to be hovering about 30 degrees above the horizon. I watched it for about 10 minutes. Then it faded away. I would appreciate you giving me some information on this. It seemed to be very large and at a low level. It changed in intensity a few times while I watched it. Is there anyone I should report this to?

I must apologize for writing so late but I wanted to be sure that I was not imagining this. I hope you will be able to help me find out what this was. If you desire any further information, you may have it.
