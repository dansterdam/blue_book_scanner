NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
24 JUNE 1960
BERMUDA

Several residents of Bermuda on the night of 24 June 1960, saw an aerial object pass over Bermuda. It was bright and appeared to be round, about 20 feet in diameter. The object appeared to be hovering and then shoot away at an extremely high rate of speed. The object was traveling very fast, emitted no sound, and left no trail. The witnesses reported that as the object came within a mile, it appeared to be shaped like a "toms" bomb, but made no noise as it passed over the ground. The UFO was traveling very fast.
