The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document that describes an observed unidentified flying object.

Mr. - couldn't determine how far away the object was, how high, or its exact size; it appeared to be about saucer size and then changed to a size of about 5 dinner plate size. The cloud, or phenomena, was light. The light looked like electrical light and could have been produced by the object itself, but he couldn't determine which. The object moved rapidly from a distant point and then suddenly stop. It appeared from a distance to be oscillating, or bullet-shaped, and its movement would be the direction skyward-groundward. Phoned in to 1903/10 September 1965.
Phoned in to TIP/TDIM (UFO): WPAFB, Ohio, to Sgt Moody. Was instructed to mail copy to that office.
