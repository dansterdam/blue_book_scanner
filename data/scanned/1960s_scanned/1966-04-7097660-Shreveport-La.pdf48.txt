We have the report that they were seen in the Barksdale Air Force Base area on June 7, 1966 at about 8:45 p.m. by me and my wife, as well as our small children. I had just gotten home from work and was working in the front yard. We noticed a light in the sky which at first appeared to be rather high and motionless. As we watched it, it started moving rapidly across the sky, then stopped and hovered. It then started moving again, stopped, hovered, and then moved off rapidly across the sky, finally disappearing from sight. The light was definitely not an airplane or a star. It was much too bright and it moved in a manner inconsistent with normal aircraft. It was several times brighter than any star in the sky at the time, and the motion was anything but steady or consistent with normal aircraft. When it was moving rapidly, it left a trail or "tail" behind it. We watched it for several minutes. My wife became quite concerned and wanted to call the authorities, but I told her I didn't think that was necessary since I felt it was probably some sort of experimental aircraft or something similar. I have no idea what it was, but it was definitely not a normal aircraft as we know them. It was a very strange and unusual sight.
