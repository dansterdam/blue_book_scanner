Mrs Hunt/Nh/AFROCO/723/2/25 JAN 66

Dear Mr. ___________,

I am enclosing our file on the Exeter, New Hampshire, UFO sightings.

Per office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has not received this file on the observation at Hampton, New Hampshire. It is possible that a report was submitted to some Air Force base and identified locally as a hoax.

The photograph taken by Mr. ________ of Devon, Pennsylvania, was not turned over to the Air Force for evaluation.

Sincerely,

J. L. SPAULDING
