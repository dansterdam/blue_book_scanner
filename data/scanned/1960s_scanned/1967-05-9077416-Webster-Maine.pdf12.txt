The undersigned is a retired aircraft inspector who has been interested in the subject of unidentified flying objects for many years. Last night, at about 8:30 PM, he witnessed an extremely unusual aerial phenomenon which he is unable to identify. The object was first observed hovering over the Webster Lake area. It suddenly accelerated at a terrific speed and climbed rapidly into the sky, disappearing from view. The object was bright white in color and was observed for several minutes. No noise was heard. The night was clear and there were no clouds. The object seemed to be under intelligent control.

The undersigned feels that this sighting is worthy of investigation and he would be willing to cooperate fully with any official agency that might be interested in pursuing this matter further. The undersigned is a highly reliable observer and he is certain that what he witnessed was something extraordinary and not of this world.
