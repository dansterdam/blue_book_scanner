The image contains a compass dial diagram and two smaller sketches. The compass dial diagram shows the 16 cardinal directions arranged in a circle. The two smaller sketches depict landscape views from the perspective of an observer, with a person standing in the foreground.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS SHOWN PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO SHOW THE OBSERVED DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT. REFER TO A SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
