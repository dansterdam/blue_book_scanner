Dear Sir,

About 9:45 PM on June 9, 1967 I got a call from my son-in-law, who asked me to go and look in the sky as he thought he saw a UFO. I asked him several questions about what he had seen and he said it was a bright silvery object and was moving erratically high in the sky.  Since I was very interested in the subject of UFOs and had seen one myself many years ago, I went outside immediately and started scanning the sky.

At about 10:00 PM I saw a bright, silvery object come into view from the southeast, moving slowly, and with a gentle rocking motion. It was approximately 1/3 the size of the full moon and was very bright, almost like a searchlight. I watched it for about 5 minutes and then it went behind some trees and I lost sight of it.

A few minutes later, the object reappeared, this time from the west, and again it was moving slowly with a rocking motion. I watched it for another 5 minutes or so and then it seemed to just fade away, or perhaps went behind more trees, I'm not sure.

I called the U.F.O. center and told them what I had seen. They were very interested and said they would send an investigator out. I am hoping you can shed some light on what the people in the sky might have been.

Sincerely,
