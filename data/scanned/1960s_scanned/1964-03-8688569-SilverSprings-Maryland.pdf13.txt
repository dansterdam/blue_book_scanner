17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with it to the object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment, what percentage of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc, and especially show the trail or vapor trail if any. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
