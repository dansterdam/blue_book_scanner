The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

My UFO was made on the 29 January 1965 at approximately 10 PM. I was looking out of my bedroom window at the night sky when I saw a bright orange/red light in the sky. It was hovering and seemed very large. It remained hovering for several minutes then took off at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. It was a clear night and the object was visible for 2-3 minutes. It appeared to be round or oblong in shape. My husband saw it with me and we were both amazed at what we saw. We have never seen anything like it before. We were both excited and wondered what it could have been. We would like to know if other people in the area reported seeing the same object that night.
