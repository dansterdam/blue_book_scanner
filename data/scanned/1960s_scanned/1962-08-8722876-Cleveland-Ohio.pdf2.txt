This image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an optical character recognition (OCR) system, I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

"Here's what I saw. I was driving along the highway near cleveland and saw a bright object hovering above the trees. It appeared to be shaped like a cigar and was almost the size of a medium sized airplane. It made no sound and moved back and forth in the sky for a few minutes before speeding away at a high rate of speed. I have never seen anything like this before and am quite puzzled by what I saw. I hope you will investigate this sighting, as I believe it may be something of importance."
