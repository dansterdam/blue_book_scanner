At the time I came down the road, I saw a strange object in the sky. It seemed to me to be around 40 or 50 feet wide, and was circular in shape. It had lights flashing on it. I watched it for 5 to 10 minutes as it hovered over the trees. It then moved off at a very high rate of speed. There was no sound to it. My wife saw it at the same time as I did. We have never seen anything like this before.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
