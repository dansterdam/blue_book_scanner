The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved object against a landscape, with instructions to place an "A" on the sketch to indicate the observer's position and a "D" to indicate where the object was seen. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road with a landscape in the background, with instructions to refer to a similar sketch to indicate how to complete the report.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the sketch to show your position. Place a "D" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

In the following larger sketch, place an "A" on the position where the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a similar sketch to indicate how to complete the report.
