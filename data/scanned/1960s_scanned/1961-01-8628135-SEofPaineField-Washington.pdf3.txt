AIR FORCE LETTER
PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
Fact. and my ground speed was 350 knots, and was ten minutes southeast of the vicinity of Paine Field, Washington.

Time and distance sighting:
(1) Time sigh ed, 1645 (Pac.
ic Daylight Saving Time), January 11, 1961.

(2) Night.

Investigation of sighting:
This sighting was investigated through the attached statements by the pilot and others concerned. Capt. Robert E. Dawson, (Pilot) and Lt. Lt. James L. Funk, Jr. (Pilot) were airborne on a routine flight in a T-33 aircraft when the sighting occurred. The object first appeared about 15-20 degrees above the horizon, at a bearing of approximately 130 degrees from the aircraft position. The object appeared to be spherical in shape, and was a very bright metallic silver in color. It remained stationary in the sky for approximately 1-2 minutes.

The object then appeared to "explode" or "disintegrate" into several smaller pieces, then re-form into the original shape, and then fly off rapidly at a high rate of speed to the northeast, disappearing from view within 10-15 seconds. The entire sighting lasted approximately 2-3 minutes. There were no other aircraft in the vicinity at that time.

And this was only a beginningâ€”for on January 15, 1961 a so-called meteor flashed across the sky in southern Oregon and northern California, lighting up Eureka, California almost like daylight.
