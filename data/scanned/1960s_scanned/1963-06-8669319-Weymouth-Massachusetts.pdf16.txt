The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed letter on Project Blue Book letterhead.

I definitely discount the statement of Putnam concerning the report of the two West Quincy sites. There have been some complaints of this sort. Does he not at least produce a pre-dated paper reporting this siting by the nearby public?

Sorry to be such a skeptic. I don't know whether any group is checking up on the sightings. They should not normally be doing so unless he actually sent pictures to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio. There may be some confirming evidence of any sighting. But if he is an experienced photographer, he should send me a copy of any letters or something. I therefore, resending a copy of your letter.

Incidentally, you may be interested to know that my new book, "The World of Flying Saucers," published by Doubleday, written jointly by myself and Mrs. Evie Byrde, will be on the bookstands in just a few days. I deal with photographic matters.

Thanking you for your interest, I am

Cordially yours,
