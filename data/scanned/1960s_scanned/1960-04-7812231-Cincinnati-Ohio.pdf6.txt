There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing handwritten text describing a UFO sighting.

Text transcribed from the document:

Appeared to turn exit light downward
Slightly and stayed over area around one
Instant and light record and both went
To the east at very high speed
Objects were about 900 feet high
Lasted only a short time with fast
Climbing and a little maneuvering and
Disappeared [Redacted name]
