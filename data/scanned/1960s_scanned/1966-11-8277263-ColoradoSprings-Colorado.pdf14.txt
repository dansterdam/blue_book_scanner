COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO
8 NOVEMBER 1966

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT - REPORT

1. On 8 November 1966, at approximately 2230 hours, the undersigned was traveling north on Interstate Highway 25 approaching Colorado Springs, Colorado, when he observed a bright light in the northwest sky.

2. The light appeared to be stationary and approximately 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be larger and brighter than any of the stars in the sky. Occasionally, the light would dim slightly and then return to its normal brightness.

3. The light remained visible for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, at which time it suddenly disappeared from view.

4. There were no clouds in the sky at the time of the observation, and the visibility was excellent.

5. This object did not resemble any known aircraft or celestial body. It is my opinion that this was an unidentified flying object.
