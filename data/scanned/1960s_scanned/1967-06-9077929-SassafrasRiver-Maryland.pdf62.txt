Transcribing the text from the document:

I heard that a woman claimed that on June 11, 1957 at about 10:30 am, a UFO was sighted over the Sassafras River in Maryland, USA. The woman said that the object was very large and made no sound. She also said that it hovered at about 500 feet altitude and that it had a triangular shape.

"And if you want to publicise that I have any connection, contact me soon, if you know who I am. Anything please."

Sincerely yours,
