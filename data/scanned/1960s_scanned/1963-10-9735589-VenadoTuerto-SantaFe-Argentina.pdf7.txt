few more passes then they turned around and returned. They were about 2 meters tall, as it seemed, and some were of plastio light armor.Their uniform when it was illuminated by the shining lights seemed to call off smoke.
Once more I had the light on top of me.I covered my face once again with the rolled up blanket and in this manner we were face to face at a distance of about 9 meters for almost a minute.In this moment the small object darkened and I saw the large vehicle pass overhead with the two red beams on and no lights in the windows.
In this manner I was able to get to the city of Monte Pais enfocused from time to time to the light and especially by this light didn't leave me until I had reached the city. It didn't glare at my face to face at any time, it seemed to come from above.When I arrived at the city I asked the first person I met where the police station was since I didn't know.
