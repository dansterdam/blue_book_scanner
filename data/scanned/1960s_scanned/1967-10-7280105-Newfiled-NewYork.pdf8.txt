There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

14. The subject was changed by Orr because he wanted to read his "story." This comprised about 10-15 typewritten pages. However, Orr did not read it. Instead, William Donovan, a representative of Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, (APRO) said he would read it. (Donovan is about the same age as we and we had the impression they were old friends.)

15. Orr stated he was trying to sell his "story" to Look magazine.

16. Donovan read the manuscript which obviously was not written by Orr. The author was someone with journalistic experience. Neither Orr nor Donovan seemed capable of writing it.

17. The story said that had witnessed "jet fighters" chasing UFO's but to no avail. They felt helpless because "our defenses were useless against these objects."

18. I asked to tell me how he knew these were jet fighters. He made a comment about "flights." Donovan changed the subject at that time.  

19. Later, Dr. Hynek queried about a statement in his "story" in which he mentioned reading "flying saucer" books. Orr admitted reading ten to fifteen of these prior to his first UFO sighting.

20. The remainder of the discussion concerned a "footprint" Orr said he photographed, and the three boys who found broken trees in the woods near Newfiled. Donovan said these trees might have been an indication that a landing had occurred.

21. As we were leaving at 2230 Donovan was asking for "all those who believe aliens were aboard these objects" to raise their hand.

22. At 2300 we arrived at the State Police station near Ithaca and asked about and Donovan. Lt Carroll said they had had reports of Donovan selling shares in APRO for $5.00 a piece.

23. It could not be determined whether and Donovan were working together for some monetary gain, or if is actually as irrational as he appeared to be.
