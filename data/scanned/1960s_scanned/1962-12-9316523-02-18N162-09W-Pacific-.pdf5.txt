19 December 1962
Seattle, Washington

MRS. BRIEFS: On December 19th, a mystery object, which exploded in a dark sky, was spotted by workers in the vicinity of Seattle, Washington. A welder at the gravel pit was the first to see the object, which was luminous and faster than a travel plane. It approached the pit and exploded in the air leaving a charred gravel pit where it had been plunged into a big ball of fire and the area was covered with thick smoke. The police said that they found a perfectly round hole, 15 feet in diameter, in the area where the object landed.
