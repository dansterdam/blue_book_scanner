The text of the document is as follows:

"Apparently a carding and lighting effect was observed for about 30 seconds. The object had lights out that varied in intensity and was glowing. It then went out of sight by shooting straight up in the sw. It was oval (or round) about 25 feet in diameter, not necessarily metallic in appearance, moved very fast but not like a normal plane or meteor, as nearly as could be determined, and the object had points of light the size of a smaller stars - smaller than the morning star. The object was first observed about 7:40 PM, CDT, and was watched for a considerable period until it shot out of sight. The witnesses attempted to get their binoculars quickly but were not able to locate the object again."
