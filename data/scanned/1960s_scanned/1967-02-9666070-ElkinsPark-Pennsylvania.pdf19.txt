REMARKS:
This man doesn't like our evaluations of his photos. I don't evaluate the photos, the photo people do and I'm sure with their evaluation, which I like, they don't like this evaluation and the only thing that I will agree to is that this man has a perfect right to disagree with our evaluation.
