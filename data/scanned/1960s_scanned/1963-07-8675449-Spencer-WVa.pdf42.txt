It was about 1900' a smith (s) with an elevation of approx 20?-22?. crossed their field of view. The observer said that the light seemed to be as large as a football and that it obscured any body of which it might have been a part. 

It was reported that at the closest point, the great light was about three miles - WAY. It traveled horizontally and as nearly parallel with the earth's surface as seen from view at an azimuth of 300? (SSW). The object was seen for only a few seconds.
The observer's visibility was excellent. No sound or visible lights, no sound or trail. This sighting was printed in Mansfield News Journal of July 26, 1963.
