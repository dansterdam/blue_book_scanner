The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book. The text in the image appears to be a handwritten response to a questionnaire, but there is no image or photograph included on this particular page.

As per your request, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: - /p - - Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting: I only saw a totally dark object hovering about 500 feet in the air over a mountaintop, approximately 2 miles away. It was totally dark in color and not reflecting any light. It seemed to be oblong or elongated in shape. It was hovering motionless for about 3-4 minutes, then suddenly shot up at a very high rate of speed and was out of sight in 2-3 seconds. I have seen numerous airplanes, helicopters, etc. in this area, but this was definitely not any type of known aircraft. It was totally silent and did not seem to have any lights or markings of any kind. There was no noise or exhaust visible.
