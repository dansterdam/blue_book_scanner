DALLAS 27, TEXAS
MARCH 16th, 1961

WADE SHATTVRRY, D.C.

DEAR SIR:

As recently as 12:07 AM CST early Tuesday morning, March 7th, I observed an unidentified object passing over the Dallas-Fort Worth area. I may have identified this object in time, but from about three seconds after first observing it, my view of the object was obstructed by some trees near my home, and the impression is left with me that I would never have been able to identify it from that standpoint.

The object appeared to be very high, at least 20,000 feet, and travelling at a moderate rate of speed, not fast enough to be a jet but considerably faster than any conventional aircraft.

I would like to report this observation, not because I think it has any special significance, but because I feel that I should report any unidentified objects I observe, in case they happen to be of interest to your organization. I am reasonably certain that the object I saw was not a conventional aircraft, but I would not speculate as to what it might have been.

Sincerely,
[Signature Redacted]
