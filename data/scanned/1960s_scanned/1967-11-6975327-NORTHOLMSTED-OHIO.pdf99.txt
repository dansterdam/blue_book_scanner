The attached additional informatlon is in response to an unidentified flytng object report from Olmsted (Cleveland) Air Traffic Control Center. 

They painted an object at approximately 2105 EST on 11 November 1967. This was approximately seventeen miles northwest of the west runway of Cleveland Hopkins Airport. The object traveled at an estimated speed of fifty mph. The object was painted by the Cleveland radar for approximately ten minutes and vanished.

Buffalo radar was also tracking the object and it disappeared from their sector approximately three miles from BUFFALO.

Is there any balloons launched from your station that might be responsible for this sighting? Do you know of any other agency launching balloons in your area?

Any assistance you can provide is appreciated.
