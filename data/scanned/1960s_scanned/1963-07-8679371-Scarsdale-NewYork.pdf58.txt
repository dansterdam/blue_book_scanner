"Spter Photo" 31 July 1963 
Scarsdale, New York 

Saucer Moving Across the Sky 
Triangular Object  

Sir:- I am enclosing a photo of a triangular-shaped unidentified object which I photographed on 31 July 1963, at Scarsdale, New York. The object appeared to me to be hovering, then began moving in a southeasterly direction. It was visible for about 30 seconds and I was able to get one exposure before it disappeared. The object was gray in color and I have made a sketch of the same. The object was approximately 50 feet across the base and about 25 feet in height. There were no lights visible, but there was a peculiar glow around the object which seemed to give off a very bright light. This light seemed to be coming from the top of the object or from within it, giving the object a brilliant glare and I have made a sketch of the same. The object appeared to be traveling at a very high speed, possibly 500-1000 mph, and was heading in a southeasterly direction. I would appreciate any information you can give me regarding this object.

Mr. Spier's photograph. 
Was directly overhead when photographed and continued in the same position for about 3 to 4 minutes. It then began to move in a southeasterly direction at a very high speed and was soon obscured by clouds. It did not appear to be controllable or have any means of propulsion visible.
