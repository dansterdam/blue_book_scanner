Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This replies to your recent letter concerning the photographs which you took. I am sorry that we have not responded more promptly, but we, too, had to obtain a translation.

Your photographs are included. Thank you for submitting them to the Air Force for evaluation.

Sincerely,
