Transcribed text from the document:

Dear Colonel:

I would like to report, the sighting of an unidentified flying object. This occurred on 5 January 1967 at approximately 7:20 pm. The object was moving in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. It was oval in shape and appeared to be metallic in color. The object suddenly changed direction and disappeared from view.

The object was observed for approximately 1 minute by three witnesses.

I am forwarding this information for your evaluation.

Sincerely,
