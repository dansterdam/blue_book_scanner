PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE: TIME 3:40 AM
2. LOCATION: Coolville, Ohio
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. MANNER OF OBJECTS: VISUAL
5. NATURE OF OBSERVATION: Over an Hour
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-visual
7. COURSE: Reported
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: The observer watched a star-like light in the sky, which then moved to the top and just faded away as though going straight up. It is felt that the observer is unable to easily recognize such stimuli as are usually associated with aircraft, meteorites, and for this reason the sighting is being reported as unidentified for an outstanding report.
