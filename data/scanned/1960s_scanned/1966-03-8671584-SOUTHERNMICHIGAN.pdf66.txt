"They reported no tangible or identifiable object. They did remark, although there was much confusion, that several of the girls saw a very bright light, very large, with several smaller lights around it, which the witness was not able to estimate the size or distance. This constitutes a story relative to this, in contrast to the more consistent description to the lights in the swamp.

According to the witness, the lights were surrounded by a glow which rose every once in a while to about 1-0 feet above the swamp, appearing to get brighter as it rose. Their rather quickly dimming out as they got some higher. It appeared, the witness said, as though it wished to avoid the periodic sweep of a nearby airplane beacon.

Van born stated that his first impression of the lights were that they were marsh lights, otherwise known as fox lights.

He told me that he was about to say that this was what they actually were, just as the girls were thought he had the solution, the red light on the right and the white light on the left (as location or these lights did not agree with the girls description) started to get more brilliant. It was at this time that the lights appeared to rise. The lights made a whistling sound and seemed to four times between 1130 pm 31 March and 1 am 22 March. Van born thought that between the two lights he could see a mass and thought it was oblong shaped. The girls, however, had described only a red light at that position.

The arrows on the sketch indicate, according to the girls, the ascent of the horizontal and vertical motion of the lights."
