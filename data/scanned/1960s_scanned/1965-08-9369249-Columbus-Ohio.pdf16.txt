11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Four hours reported as the duration of the sighting, including
nights. Every night from midnight to 4 A.M. (Clear nights only)
Light bright-dim to light-bright, shifting colors, stationary and
also reported as rushing away at times. Observed in west.
Appeared to move from north to south. Small object, about the size of
a star. Thought to be about 150 ft from the observer. Yellow
motion contrary to Star/Planet motion, however, not cast as
Star/Planet due to characteristics and was observed in the same place
at the same hour on all clear nights. Witness reported the object
and sighting to the Air Force, but made no effort to see what it was
(as it was (according that it was within 150 ft). Sufficient
data to establish that the observation reported is inaccurr
ate or illusionary.
