Dear Sirs:

In your letter of October 15, you will tell you our beliefs about the unidentified flying objects. We tell you that these objects are not space ships from another planet, but are:

On a flying object of unknown nature landed in Angeles National Forest on August 3, 1962. Reliable witnesses saw three occupant beings.

We say that this object contained a high beings from another planet outside of our solar system or outside our universe. We can give you more information about our planet to the world, where these beings come from, but the first step is that you must request information to your government on the matter of this incident.

Witness: examples of the United Air Lines viscount over St. Louis. We theorize that this UFO which had a supper power,appeared at the head of our time, and still has a mystery power. These beings made this UFO carry a huge power on a house in Angeles National Forest, a week prior to this report . It would be most appreciated if you would send us all the material known, such as photographs, measurements and charts concerning this case, and any other information to continue studies concerning things extraterrestrial.

Sincerely Yours,

Stephen M. Halbert
President, Studies
Company.
