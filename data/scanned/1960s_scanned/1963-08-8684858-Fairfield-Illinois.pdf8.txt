October 21, 1963

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in response to your recent letter in which you report seeing an unusual light in the skies over Fairfield, Illinois on August 10th.

The sighting which took place at Fairfield was definitely established as two objects, light emanating from the ground to the sky, such as searchlights or the beams of powerful spotlights. These beams of light were observed lifting off from the ground and ascending into the skies, stopping, and then descending to the ground, repeating this action over and over. Some witnesses reported observing more than one set of these light beams performing this maneuver.

It is impossible to give you the exact route followed by the Air Force investigators during their investigation of the incident, but they have reported that the sighting was not considered by them to be an unusual occurrence, and these phenomena are often quite easily explainable.

It is noteworthy to give you the exact route followed by the Air Force investigators during their investigation of the incident, but they have reported that the sighting was not considered by them to be an unusual occurrence, and these phenomena are often quite easily explainable. 

Since there are only a minute percentage of cases which have remained unsolved, and these only because the information given to the investigators was too sparse, it may be assumed that your sighting had a logical explanation, such as BOZO statistics plus a searchlight.
