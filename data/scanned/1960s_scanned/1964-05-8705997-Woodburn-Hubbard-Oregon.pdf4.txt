K. ARTHUR F. SHIFLETT, MAJ, USAF, STAFF INTELLIGENCE
OFFICER: INASMUCH AS THE INFORMATION RECEIVED WAS
INSUFFICIENT FOR COMPLETION OF THE INITIAL REPORT 
AND BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY OF THE INCIDENT, 
ALLEGED OCCURENCE IT WAS AGREED THAT ADDITIONAL
ON SITE INFORMATION SHOULD BE OBTAINED. IT IS FELT
THAT THIS IS A PRODUCT OF THE YOUNG LAD,S IMAGINATION.
HIS DRAWING OF THE MACHINE WAS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO
THAT PRESENTED IN A CURRENT COMIC STRIP. CONSIDER
HIS OBSERVATION TO BE A NON RELIABLE IMPROBABLE
REPORT (F-32).
