AUG 14 1967
Proposed reply to letter from Barbara Goode, July 29, 1967 (Sighting Jul 1967)

Dear Mrs.
Reference your recent letter in which you reported your unidentified
observation.

It would be extremely difficult to perform a comprehensive investigation based on your observation; you neglected to mention the time, date and location of your sighting. If you would report your sighting to your nearest military installation (if your sighting occurred in the United States) at the time, our analysts and evaluators would have attempted to determine what you had observed. If we had been unable to find a logical answer, then your case would have been categorized as UNIDENTIFIED.

You did not mention whether your observation occurred in the United States or Canada. The United States Air Force lacks jurisdiction to investigate these sightings outside its continental limits. In the future, if you should observe another UFO, please contact your nearest military installation; for the local investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

The enclosed information on Project Blue Book may be of interest to you and your husband. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
