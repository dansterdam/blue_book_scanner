The image contains three illustrations. The top one is a compass rose diagram with instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction to a phenomenon when first seen. The two illustrations below show sketches of a person's perspective when observing a UFO or other phenomenon in the sky.

Here is the text I have extracted from the document:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X AT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". APPEAR TO BE STATIONARY, CURVED OR ZIGZAGGED, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS PORTION.
