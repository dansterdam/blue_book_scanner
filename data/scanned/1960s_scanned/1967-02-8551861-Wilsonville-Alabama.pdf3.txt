The image contains a diagram showing the horizon (skyline) and the position of an object or objects above it at various angles. There is also a compass rose diagram showing the different directions. The text in the image appears to be instructions or questions related to the diagrams.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text from the document as requested:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are the observer at the point shown. Place a "B" on the same curved line as the horizon (skyline) where you first saw the object. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object. Show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
