AT WHAT TIME DID THIS INCIDENT OCCUR?
At about 2:0 minutes until 5 a.m., 3 just sat down in the car. OO's 442 HARDTOP 58 MODEL, started the engine and about the time turned 6 the light to brake before turning to the right to head off towards the end of the street. I turned off the ignition and went out and watched until I had to run down or up the street (east) to put it in view. It was so close that it was about to pass a story and a half house (1st frame) across the street from one.
I watched it until it disappear over the trees from me. The most significant in this direction of Cincinnati.
After I alighted a really and it seemed to me that they didn't even have been traveling on the same direction as IR 72 and I believe that the distance was more from one, something like Springfield to Cincinnati.
I am sure that if you would find some one that was passing by south east on IR 72 and both between 4:40 AM they should be able to give you a good and length description of it, that was so natural and peculiar, although approaching it with a high speed, but the Dayton Pike and the I-75 are near by.
