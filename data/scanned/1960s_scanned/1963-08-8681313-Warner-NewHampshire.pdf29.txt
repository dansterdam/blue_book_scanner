The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book, with multiple fill-in-the-blank questions.

Text from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear, to you, as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In your own words can you give a clear picture as a person of what kind of object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the objects which you saw?
