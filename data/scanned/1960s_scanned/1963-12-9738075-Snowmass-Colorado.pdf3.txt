Mrs. Snowmass, 
Colorado

Dear Mrs. Snowmass,

I have been unable to learn when you gave me, to which you refer about the unidentified flying objects you saw. 

I am taking the liberty of forwarding your very interesting letter on to the Office of Information in Washington. You will probably hear further on this matter in due course.

Thank you for sending this information to me. I am sorry I cannot give you more data than you already have.

Sincerely

ROBERT A. WEBB
Major, USAF
Information Officer
