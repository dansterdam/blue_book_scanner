Jupiter Dazzles the Eye 
Jupiter is a brilliant star in September. Seen in Sagittarius, the archer, it stands high in the south.
Look toward the north. The great planet Venus is now high in the west, fainter than Jupiter but still very bright. Saturn, too, is in the western sky, but he is now low, gradually being overtaken by the sun's light.
At the lower right of the map is a legend describing symbols for the order of brightness of celestial objects.
