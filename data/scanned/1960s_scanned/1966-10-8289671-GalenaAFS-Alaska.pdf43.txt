There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s and 1960s.

The text on the page discusses the Project Blue Book program and its approach to investigating UFO reports. It mentions that the program's budget was tripled, and that Blue Book is responsible for doing justice to all reports, both good and bad, from the standpoint of data-gathering. The text also discusses the program's staffing, noting that it employs carefully selected assistants who can handle letter answering, filing, and indexing.

The text then goes on to discuss the skeptical nature of Blue Book's approach, stating that "few reports merit an all-out effort" and that the program is "perpetually behind" when it comes to investigating sightings. It also suggests that the Air Force's policy is to view UFOs as misidentifications rather than actual phenomena.

Overall, this page appears to provide an insider's perspective on the operations and approach of Project Blue Book.
