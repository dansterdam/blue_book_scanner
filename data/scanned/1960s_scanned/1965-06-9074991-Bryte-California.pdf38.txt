On the 5th of June, 1965, in the dark early morning hours, the area just outside of Bryte, California was lighted up by a strange light source, and was observed by the residents of Bryte. The witness said "It was a strange looking light" without any tail or appendage. Without warning, there was a blinding flash, and a brilliant explosion, similar to daylight. We looked up and saw a bulb-shaped white light that lasted only a few seconds.

West of Cache Levee, there was a loud double explosion, and then everything went dark. A resident found no damage caused.

Five days after the Pill phenomenon, most of Sydney, Australia suffered a two-hour power failure. Two men there separately met with an accident due to a violent electrical storm which struck Sidwell shortly after midnight. Mr. G. would not comment.

The foregoing is only one of many similar experiences which have plagued certain areas, including Phoenix and Yuma, suffered a continuous cessation of electrical power. In no instance was a UFO reported, and there was no thunderstorm activity. It is the opinion of the military that certain areas would be extremely vulnerable during such a calamity, however.
