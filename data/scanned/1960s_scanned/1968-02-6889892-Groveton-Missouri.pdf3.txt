Dear Major Quintanilla,

I am enclosing an article which appeared in the Groveton, Missouri newspaper on January 30, 1968. This article describes an incident involving a UFO sighting on the evening of January 28, 1968.

The article states that two observers, Mr. and Mrs. Donald L. White, saw a bright light in the sky at approximately 7:30 p.m. on January 28. According to the article, the object remained stationary for several minutes before moving rapidly across the sky and disappearing from view.

The article mentions that the White family has reported several similar sightings in recent years, and that local authorities have been unable to explain the phenomena. It also notes that Air Force investigators from Project Blue Book have been informed of the incident.

I was wondering if your office could provide any additional information or analysis regarding this case. Please let me know if you require any further details.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
