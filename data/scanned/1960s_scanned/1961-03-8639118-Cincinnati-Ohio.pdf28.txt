The image contains hand-drawn sketches illustrating how a UFO sighting may have appeared to an observer. The first sketch shows a curved line along the horizon, with an object above the horizon at different heights. The second sketch shows a larger view, with a person standing on a road and two smaller views of the sky above, indicating how the object may have appeared from different vantage points.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where the object was when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
