REPLY TO Hq USAF SAF-OI 3b (Mrs Geiser) 
WAFR 25 D C

1. Reference the attached letter from Sgt TDEW of Lincoln, New Hampshire, on unidentified objects. Our investigation has been completed and a report is being prepared pertaining to various sightings. He has also received the DOD Sheet; This letter is forwarded to your office for whatever action you deem necessary.

2. Specific answers pertaining to the case of Sep 19-20, 1961 are as follows:

a. The Barney Hill sighting was investigated by officials from the Blue Book AFRP. The case was found to be insufficient direction (Estimate) and was reported and there are inconsistencies in the report. The sighting could not be adequately explained and the object was maneuverable. Velocities were given. The planet Jupiter was in the South West. It is doubtful that the object in question could have been Jupiter. The planet Jupiter was in the South West. The approximate time that the object disappeared without incident conflates that the object could not have been evaluated as
Jupiter. No movement was noticed. The object was identified as the planet Jupiter in all probability.

b. The Air Force did not investigate the sightings in Hollywood, California on Feb 5, 1960.
