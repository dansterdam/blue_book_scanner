Dear Sirs:

I don't know what to do about what I saw the other night. I guess I had my head messed up.

It was over my girl friend's house. We were fooling around, looking around a bush. As we were watching television in the same old place.

At exactly 7:30 PM, I left her house. I stood out on the back porch looking around. The sky was clear and the wind was blowing hard. After looking around for a while, I saw something in the sky. It was a 70 degree angle. It had bright lights and was traveling at a speed of about 95-100 mph.

I walked out into the street and turned to see if [REDACTED] was watching it. I pulled up on our back yard and saw the U.F.O. was coming at a downward slant toward me. It started moving. I rushed back to see if I could get a lower angle. It started running faster at once.

I'm so fast that when it turned around, I was right under it. It got the same thing as when I got on the porch. The thing is just moving a lot faster than anything I ever saw. When I got out there, it had been 5 minutes was so frightened that I was unable for the rest of the night.
