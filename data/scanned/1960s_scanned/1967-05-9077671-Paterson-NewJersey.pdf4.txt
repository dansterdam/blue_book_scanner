The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in Paterson, New Jersey on June 21, 1967.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sir:
This is an article involving us, in the Paterson Daily News Paper: "Two boys, 12 and 13 years old, relieved to be the first to spot a UFO shortly after 9 p.m. Wednesday night. Agnes Granger, a 12 year old grade student in St. Agnes Grammar School, called the news as soon as he returned home after viewing the strange object in the sky. He said the object hovered over Park Street, shortly after 9 p.m. when they spotted it. Another large, dim glowing object then appeared and moved about one minute in one spot and then moved rapidly until it disappeared from view."
There is something that was not mentioned in the article, that in the opinion of those close enough to the ground to hear a soft sort of noise, but there was none.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
