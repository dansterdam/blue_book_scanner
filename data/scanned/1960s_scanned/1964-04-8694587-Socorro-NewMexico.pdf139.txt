The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Additional Notes to the Report:
It should be noted that, at the time Zamora saw the insignia, the craft was well illuminated by auxiliary lights which seemed to form some experiments with placards with insignia and different patterns inscribed thereon to see how well these are visible, under good lighting, at 100-200 feet.

Additional Note: What is the power of Zamora's glasses? Does he suffer from a stigmatism?

Additional Note: Several things are a pity in this situation. One is that there was not an additional witness. Second is that no photographs were taken. Third, that no radars picked up the object, and fourth that the witness whom we did have was not a better observer and more articulate.

Recommendations: The object which produced this, if it was a new device under test or in maneuvers, be brought to some location and devices taken of it departing in the manner described by Zamora, and under the same lighting conditions. This then could be played at any future hearings on flying saucers. This, it seems to me, could go a very long way toward exploding the myth of flying saucers. This it seems to me would be more good than all the previous years of propaganda.
