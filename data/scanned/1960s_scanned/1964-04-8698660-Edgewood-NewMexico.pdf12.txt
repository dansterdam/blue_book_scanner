It is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text that describes an incident where a 10-year-old girl was burned by strange rays while watching a UFO saucer flap in the New Mexico portion of the sky on April 28th. The text provides details about the girl, Sharon Stull, being one of five children of Mr. and Mrs. Max Stull who suffered eye, nose, and face burns while watching the UFO for 5-10 minutes. The text also mentions that Sharon was not facing the sun while watching the object, which was slightly smaller than an airplane and had no windows.

GIRL BURNED BY STRANGE RAYS WHILE WATCHING UFO: In another incident in the New Mexico portion of the incredible 1964 saucer flap, a 10-year-old received painful facial burns while watching a "strange egg-shaped thing" in the sky on the afternoon of April 28th. Sharon Stull, one of five children of Mr. and Mrs. Max Stull, suffered eye, nose and face burns during the five to ten minutes that she watched the UFO from the play yard of her school in Albuquerque. Sharon was not facing the sun while watching the object, which was slightly smaller than an airplane and without windows of any kind. Her mother as well as the doctor who examined the girl felt that she could not have received a normal sunburn during the few minutes she was outdoors. The doctor found membrane irritation.
