27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE:
ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.
ACCORDING TO MY SON (WHO ARRIVED HOME BY CAR) they first saw the object while pulling up to the curb and then got a better view as they drew closer to it. I say an object which was somewhat larger than a star and stood still over the city in an area about 5 to 10 degrees above the horizon. It gave off a faint light and passed over the sky in about 5 to 10 minutes.
Since my husband had a (pretty much so) similar experience as did my son, I will make this for both of us.
