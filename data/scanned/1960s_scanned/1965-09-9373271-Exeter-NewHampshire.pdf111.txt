POLICE, CIVILIANS SIGHT UFO IN EXETER AREA
EXETER - An unidentified flying object, witnessed here by at least four policemen and several civilians, hovered over the police station from 2:36 a.m. to 3:10 a.m. today, it was reported.
Exeter police station, at 2:45 a.m., received a call that an object was "hovering over the town." Officer Eugene Bertrand answered the call, and he reported that the object was "definitely not an airplane or a helicopter." The object, which gave off a bright red glow, moved over the town and then headed in a southwesterly direction.
Tapping strange activities, a police car with three patrolmen was dispatched to investigate the sighting. The car followed the object for some distance at a high rate of speed, but it then disappeared. 
According to the report, the object was seen and described by four policemen and several civilians. The object was said to be 40 to 50 feet in diameter and was estimated to be 50 to 75 feet off the ground at the closest point. The object was described as having a bright red light or glow at the top and a white light from the bottom. The object made no noise and moved very quickly and silently. 
One of the most amazing features, according to the report, was that the object appeared to be under intelligent control, as it would move away whenever the police car approached it.
The police station in Hampton also received a telephone call about the sighting, and it reported that a similar object had been seen in that area.
