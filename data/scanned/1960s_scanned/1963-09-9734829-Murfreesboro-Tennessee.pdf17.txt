Texas Tower Men See Light
Nineteen men aboard Texas Tower IX reported sighting a bright light and smoke in the distance, which appeared to be the nautical equivalent of a flying saucer, a Coast Guard investigation was requested. The Coast Guard sent a plane to investigate, but the object seen by the tower personnel had vanished before the plane arrived. A subsequent search by plane which took over an hour revealed nothing.
The Coast Guard told the State that they, the Tower personnel, say it had a controlled white appearance.
