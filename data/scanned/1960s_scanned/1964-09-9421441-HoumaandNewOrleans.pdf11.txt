Dear Sir:

Enclosed are two negatives of two stars taken at the request of the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office. On September 16, 1964, an apparent stellar object was photographed at 8:49 p.m. in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, over the Baton Rouge Airport. The film used was Agfa-Gevaert and alpha Orionis. The object of alpha Orionis was taken at 09:51. The film used was Konica. Both negatives are attached for your examination.

When at Louisiana State University, there appeared to alternate red-green lights. It is clearly noted that these stars are brighter and more clearly defined than the usual star images, and their alternation appears to indicate the presence of some metallic or reflecting object between the observer and the star field.

All objects observed to alternate red-green here proved to be of such a nature and that their image stability and freedom from background apparent motion was most unusual and remarkable.

Microscopic examination of the negatives showed nothing out of the ordinary with the exception of the slight movement of the fainter field stars which is probably due to some slight movement of the telescope. The center of the image showed no sign of any air turbulence or other distortion.

There were not made of the negatives, as they in actuality have little to do with the possible identification of Unidentified Flying Objects.

Sincerely yours,
