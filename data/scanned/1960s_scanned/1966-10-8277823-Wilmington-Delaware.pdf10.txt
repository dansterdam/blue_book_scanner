October 6, 1966

Gentleman,

On the night of October 5, 1966 at approximately 10:45 a sighted this strange light in the sky. One appeared to be a white dot, about the size of a pin head, fell about an arms length away, moving across the sky at a reasonable speed. The object was changing color and would go from a bluish white to greenish white, then to a reddish-orange. As the red object approached the white light, the white light stopped, stayed still and let the red object pass overhead. Then it came back on its approximately same course and stayed on the same course as before, the light went out of sight for about 3-5 seconds, then the white light about 4-5 minutes. The red object was fiery and was a steady light which did not blink as I watched it.
