The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document. It does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten letter addressed to an Operations Officer at the Mc Dill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida.

Dear Sir:

Writing with the hope that you can supply me with some information that I am curious about. The object that I am interested in is a photo or a description of a lighted streamers balloon in operation and how they operate at night.
As an ex-service man(1945-1953) and a native U.F.O. fan,there is an other item that I am curious about.
If you have two jets flying a parallel course,why is it that one jet has the usual navigation lights,and the other jet has only one light? Is this a single light an unrelated object to the jet?
The reason for the questions are the diagram on the attached sheet of what I have seen in the sky April 27,1964.(7:45-8:15)

Cordially,
