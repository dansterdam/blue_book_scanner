The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" marking on it, and a curved object above the horizon line. The second sketch shows a landscape scene with a person walking on a road, and a smaller sketch of a mountainous landscape.

IN THE FOLLOWING SKETCH, IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN. PLACE AN "A" ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE OBJECT WAS ABOVE THE HORIZON (SKYLINE) WHEN YOU FIRST SAW IT. PLACE A "B" ON THE SAME CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE OBJECT WAS WHEN YOU LAST SAW IT.

IN THE FOLLOWING LARGER SKETCH, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION THE OBJECT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW IT, AND A "B" AT ITS POSITION WHEN YOU LAST SAW IT. REFER TO A SIMILAR SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT DETAIL TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
