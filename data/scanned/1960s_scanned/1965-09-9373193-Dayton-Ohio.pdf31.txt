NEW ORLEANS 70190
February 1, 1966

The Commanding General
R-6-B.A.P.
Colorado Springs, Colorado

Dear General:

In res: Missile over Kentucky

In the late afternoon of September 7th, at just about 6:00 o'clock Central Standard Time (7:00 P.M. Eastern Standard), a missile was observed to be proceeding on a northeast course.

The rounded forward end of this missile was illuminated by the setting sun in the west. The missile was traveling in a straight and had a gold metallic appearance. There was a mist or white cloud around the missile, from away a distance.

The trajectory followed the surface of the earth at about a 90Â° angle to where it appeared to level off.

The missile left a light greenish-yellow or yellowish-green vapor behind where it passed out of view.

The missile, or some other flying object or objects, was seen by people at the time all the way from Louisville to Cincinnati, but I have a creditable report that it was observed from my own home on the great Claiborne Farm horse breeding establishment, located on the Ohio River, south of Cincinnati. I may state the missile emerged from behind some trees on my far right, and sped across the sky until it went out of sight.

This missile went at the speed of a super-sonic plane, or perhaps two or three times that speed.

There was no sound.

I was standing by my side at the time, and accustomed to outdoor observation, said immediately, "Take that! A warhead!"

Artickee machine from Paris, Kentucky, Enterprise and the Cincinnati Enquirer, relative to object or objects seen by others at approximately the same time, the early evening of September 7th.

Is it possible a stage of the missile may have dropped off in the vicinity? At any rate, I pass this information to you and I saw the observed detail.
