K. CHIEF, COMBAT INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, WEATHER OFFICE MCCOY AFB STATED THAT WITH THE DOUBLE INVERSION BALLOONS RELEASED FROM NEARBY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE PRODUCED MULTIPLE ILLUSIONS BUT THAT CONSIDERING WINDS AND THE FACT OF TWO DIFFERENT SIGHTINGS, THIS WOULD NOT BE LIKELY. THERE WERE NO AIRCRAFT FROM MCCOY OR SANFORD NAVAL AIR STATION IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS DETECTED BY AGC OR APPROACH CONTROLS AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING. OBSERVER IN QUESTIONING SEEMED RELIABLE.
