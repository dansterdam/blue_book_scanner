34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
Im wondering if the amount of detail i have provided about the sounds and movements of the object is too much, but i felt it was pertinent to describe the event as fully as possible so that you would have all the information needed to assess it properly. My description of the incredible speed and maneuverability of the object may strain credulity, but i can assure you that i am a serious and responsible observer and that i have described the incident exactly as i witnessed it, to the best of my recollection. I hope this information is useful to your investigation.
