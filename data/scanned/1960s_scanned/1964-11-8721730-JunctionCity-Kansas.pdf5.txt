Department of the air Force
Office of the Adjutant General
Washington, D.C. 
Dear sir:   
We are sorry to say this but some- thing we have seen indicates that the unusual aerial activity which you reported to us may have a more mundane explanation.  

While we share your interest in the unusual, it is our policy to respond only to those reports which can be shown to involve actual aerial phenomena of scientific interest. information that suggests a natural or mechanical origin for an observed event is not considered worth further investigation on our part. 

We appreciate your taking the time to share your observations with us, and we hope you will understand that this letter is not meant to dismiss your concerns, but rather to explain our limited role in this type of matter.

Sincerely yours,
