Dear ___,

I regret the delay in answering your letter of March 28th.

The sighting you witnessed was evaluated as being an aircraft with considerable antigravity elements or air traffic in the New York area. It was possible to determine which specific aircraft caused the contrail; however, the duration of the sighting is evaluated within the speed of the object. Your interest is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM J. LOOKADOO
