The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. There is no photograph present in this image. Instead, the image shows a grid-like pattern, possibly a form or data table. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will proceed to extract all the textual content from the document:

Subject was reported by witnesses as an object resembling a flying saucer. It was observed over Cape Girardeau, Missouri on July 8, 1964. The object was described as silver-colored and approximately 30 feet in diameter. It was seen to come down and hover over a residential area, then rise vertically and depart at a high rate of speed.
