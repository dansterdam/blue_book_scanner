TWO AF LINGUIST PILOTS DIE SOONER
THE LOLLIPOPITES LANDED GRIRiiN, 'i'HEY TOLD THEIR UFO EXPERIENCE --- The two linguist pilots were on a rouiine flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Montevideo, Uruguay. They were at about 25,000 ft when they first noticed a bright light off to the north. As they watched, the light grew larger and brighter until they could make out the shape of a metallic, disc-shaped object. The object was much larger than their own aircraft and was traveling at an incredible speed. Suddenly, it made a sharp 90 degree turn and raced away at unbelievable velocity. The pilots were amazed and puzzled by what they had seen. Their report was filed with Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official UFO investigation organization. The significance of this incident lies in the fact that the pilots were highly trained and experienced, and yet they could not explain what they had observed. Their testimony lends credence to the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena.
