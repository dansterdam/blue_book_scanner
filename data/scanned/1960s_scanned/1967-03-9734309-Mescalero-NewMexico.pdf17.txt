MEMO FOR THE RECORD - - - - HOLLOMAN AFB

Observer reported visual sighting of 30 to 40 objects viewed over a 45 minute period. Radar paints or unknowns were noted during time of visual observation. Radar painted an object flying close-in at 25,000 feet at 1.5 much speed up to much 3.

The objects were reported to be servo-driven, with noise in the radar gate. The data prints on radar showed visual sightings of numerous targets. The visual sighting confirms the radar observation. The visual sighting was a bright point of light which confirms the radar reading. There were no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting, according to airborne aircraft sighting.

The only apparent explanation is a shaft drop in the area. We cannot admit to accepting charts, however, this explanation appears to be a reasonable one.
