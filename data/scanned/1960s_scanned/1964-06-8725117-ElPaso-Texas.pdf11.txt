Dear Major Mannf - 
The enclosed material was received from our Flying Saucer Evaluation Office at the time of the El Paso UFO report. The information contained therein appears to be of some significance in view of the fact that several independent observers purportedly saw the phenomena. As you will note from the content of the report, a sighting of some kind was observed from several locations in and around El Paso, Texas, on the evening of June 8, 1964. It would appear that a further investigation into this matter might be warranted.

Respectfully,
