The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

A STAR BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE CLEARLY IN DAYLIGHT A UPO HAD A LENGTHENING TAIL AND WAS BRIGHTER.

THE LOGS SET UP A BIT MORE OUT OF A HOUSE THEY WERE NOT AWAKE COULD DO THAT.
