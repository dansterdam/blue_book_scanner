The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a record card from Project 10073, which seems to be a Project Blue Book document. The text on the card provides details about an observation that occurred on 8 January 1963 in College Park, Maryland. The observation lasted 3-5 minutes and involved one object. The conclusions section notes that the object was not contributing to a cause, except for possible distorting or disturbing effects, and that no information was presented which conflicted with the analysis presented, which was possibly with an afterburner.
