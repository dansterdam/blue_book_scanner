PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 4 March, 1950
2. LOCATION: Dubuque, Iowa
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. COURSE: NE
6. DURATION OF SIGHTING: 20 minutes
7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: three
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Unidentical objects, size of a quarter in the sky, traveling at an apparent speed of 1500-2000 mph, occasionally blinking on and off slightly, and just disappeared.
The source of this light was difficult to determine, nor was the size or altitude of the objects definable. There was nothing unusual or extraordinary about the observation, nor anything such as described by the witness, just, as in the main, an unusual observation which remains unidentified. There were no other objects visible during the observation, and the observation was made by two civilian adults who were driving a car. This episode was apparently not observed on this film.
