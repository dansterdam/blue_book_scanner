1. Reference the attached unidentified flying objects. The following information is supplied:

2. Our files reveal no previous correspondence with Mr. --------- and it is suggested that a fact sheet be included with your reply.

3. No date was given for Mr. --------- sighting of 1952, and it therefore cannot be connected with any known sightings. Since similar sightings, no investigation was made.

4. Our files do not have any cases from Colorado for the newspaper article of 26 December 1962. No evaluation of the newspaper article is made but some indications point to the possibility of a hoax. The newspaper article is noted.
