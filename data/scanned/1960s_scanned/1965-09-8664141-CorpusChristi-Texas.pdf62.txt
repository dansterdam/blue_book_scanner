The article reports that a Peruvian landing occurred on September 23rd in the An-
ti-Comunist Forces district. The craft was sighted at about 9:30 PM by a Peruvian lieu-
tenant and two other witnesses. The craft disappeared in a brilliant flash. After the 
flash there was a tremendous roar, and the craft took off suddenly at a high speed, 
leaving a trail of bright particles. The whole incident lasted for about three minutes.
