Last night (January 21) my wife and I were driving home from a party about 10 miles south of Andrews, S.C. It was about 9:30 p.m. when we saw what appeared to be a light colored object, orange in color, and very bright. It was motionless at first, then started moving at a high rate of speed north, then west to east. It was higher than the average plane, and it only lasted for about 5 miles. It seemed to rise in the sky as it moved east. Seconds later it was gone from sight. It was not a reflection and was not a star or plane, as the movement and characteristics were quite different. There was no sound came from it.
