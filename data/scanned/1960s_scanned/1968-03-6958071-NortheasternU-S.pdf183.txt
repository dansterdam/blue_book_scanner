ZOND & DEBRIS REENTRY OF 1968 MARCH 3

On this date at approximately 5:45 p.m. M.S.T., a rather brilliant object appeared, being reported to one of our active A.M.S. members, Glen Wells, at University of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky. He at once had a fireball questionnaire published in a local paper. Due to this, reports came from many people. The writer at first assumed that it was a fireball with time of visibility greatly exaggerated, but as all reports showed a great duration it became evident that it was something unusual. Soon thereafter Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio sent a large number of reports which had come to them. And ---- at Denver, Office of United States, received a number of reports from many people. Later Professor V.H. Chappell, Abrams Planetarium, East Lansing, Michigan, sent several reports and a key one came from Sky and Telescope. Eventually over 60 were available from all sources. Only with this prompt and efficient assistance, which is most gratefully acknowledged, could this solution be made.

It was obvious that this case could be handled by the same methods we use for fireballs. Hence the usual chart was prepared with all stations plotted thereon and the azimuth lines to sub-beginning and sub-end points drawn. Each such solution represents its peculiar difficulties and, in this, it is that too many stations lie quite near the vertical plane of body's motion. For some it actually crossed this vertical plane.
