CONFIDENTIAL
Case No.: 63-2364/35 
Location: Suva, Fiji Islands
Date: April 9, 1963
Investigating Officer: Unknown

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. On April 9, 1963, at 1:25 p.m., a U.S. Air Force KC-135 jet tanker aircraft, flying at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet, was observed by the crew to be "paced" by an unidentified object for a distance of about 250 miles. 

2. The object was described as being approximately the same size as the KC-135, circular in shape, and metallic in appearance. It maintained a constant position relative to the aircraft, approximately 1/2 mile to the left and slightly below the aircraft.

3. After the object had maintained this position for about 25 minutes, it accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight. 

4. The crew consisted of the pilot, co-pilot, navigator, and two other crew members. All five crew members observed the object and confirmed the above details.

5. This report has been reviewed by the Commanding Officer of the U.S. Air Force unit involved. He states that the crew members are all experienced and reliable, and that he has no reason to doubt the validity of their observations.

6. The object did not show up on the aircraft's radar, and no other aircraft were in the vicinity at the time. Weather conditions were clear, with unlimited visibility.

7. This report is being forwarded to Project Blue Book for further evaluation and analysis.
