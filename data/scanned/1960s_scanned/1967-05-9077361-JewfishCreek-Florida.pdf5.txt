Born in Florida, had many strange encounters with unusual objects in the sky in the area where I live. Over the years I have witnessed several strange objects which I have never been able to identify or explain. The objects I have seen have been moving at very high speeds, changing directions abruptly, appearing and disappearing. Some of the objects seemed to be intelligently controlled, but I cannot say for certain what they were. I have reported some of these sightings to the authorities over the years, but nothing ever came of it.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? Reported this sighting to the Air Force Base at Jacksonville, FLa. about 4 or 5 days after I saw it.
