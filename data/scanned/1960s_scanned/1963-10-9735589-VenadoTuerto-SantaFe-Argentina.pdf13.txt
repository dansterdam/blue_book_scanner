LANDING IN ARGENTINA: From our special correspondent we learn that landings or flying saucers in Argentina have continued throughout 1962. On September 29th, 1963, a truck driver near Santa Fe told police that at 5:30 a.m. on that date, he saw an object the size of a truck with a dome land on the road and a small humanlike figure emerged from it. The figure approached the truck and the driver became frightened and drove off, leaving the object behind. He later learned from police that the object had taken off and disappeared. Doctors who examined the driver were not able to find the cause of the burns.
