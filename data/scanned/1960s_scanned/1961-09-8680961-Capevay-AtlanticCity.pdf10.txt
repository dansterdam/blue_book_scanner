ASTRONOMY

Jupiter Dazzles the Eye

Jupiter is nearly 20 times as bright as a first magnitude star in September-June, when it stands highest in the south next to Saturn, James Stokley reports. 

The more brilliant shining of Jupiter, in the more brilliant portion of the year, is due to its being closer to the earth. Its distance is about 400 million miles, whereas in the opposite part of its orbit it is nearly 600 million miles away and therefore much fainter.

The brightest star at this time of the year is Sirius, the "dog star." But Jupiter outshines it by nearly three times. 

Capella stands low in the northeast. Altair, one of the summer stars, sets in the west shortly after dark.

The chart shows the relative positions of the stars and planets around Jupiter as of September 26, 1961.
