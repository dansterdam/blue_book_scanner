The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page of a document, likely from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects.

Here is the text from the document:

To men who have study the matter more carefully than I, the case of the unidentified objects in the sky often referred to as flying saucers) has long been a matter of deep interest. Many of us have been fascinated by the reports which from time to time have come to us, and have sought diligently to discover some satisfactory explanation for them. This has not been easy, and I am convinced that the matter deserves further and more thorough study than it has yet received.

I am aware that there are many competent men—scientists, military and other authorities—who have examined these reports and have concluded that at least a considerable proportion of them can be accounted for as misidentifications of ordinary phenomena such as balloons, airplanes, planets, meteors and the like. And there is no doubt that this is true in many instances. But when all such cases have been eliminated, there still remain a number of reports which are difficult to explain on any such basis.

I do not feel competent to pass final judgment on this matter. I can only say that it seems to me that the official attitude of summary dismissal of the whole subject as mere superstition or hallucination is not warranted. I believe the problem deserves serious study by competent and open-minded investigators.
