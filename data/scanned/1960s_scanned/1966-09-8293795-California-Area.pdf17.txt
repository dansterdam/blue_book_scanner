Dear Sirs,
I have for a request. It may be of some importance concerning a sighting of an unidentified flying object on September 6, 1966. The sighting took place in Greenville, North Carolina around 10:00 p.m. The object was described as a very bright light that hovered over the area for a minute or two and then accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared. It was witnessed by several people in the area. I am interested in any information you can provide regarding this incident. It would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
