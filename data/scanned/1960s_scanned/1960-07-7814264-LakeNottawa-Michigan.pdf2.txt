Gentlemen,

I understand that projects observed, related to the "Unidentified Flying Object Study" have a sometimes unbased and selftific attitude.

It can assure you that the actions described on the enclosed sheet occurred a month before the coverage to date, was completely unknown to me, and the actions have the earmarks of extremely poor planning or judgment. However, it may be inferred that the events took place as related in that incident that occurred have importance that demands attention.

I am assured that cooperation of the Air force, maintaining the strictest confidentiality, that there are no such reports as "flying saucers" that can be identified as that the identification of the objects have been made to the satisfaction of all, and I would appreciate verification of this to satisfy my personal observation.
