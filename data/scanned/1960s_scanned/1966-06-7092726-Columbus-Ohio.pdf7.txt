The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and sketches. The diagram appears to be a compass or navigation tool, and the sketches appear to be related to describing the path and movement of unidentified objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. These are "A" and "B" on the compass.

28. Draw a picture that shows that the objects moved along a "U" shaped path, or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
