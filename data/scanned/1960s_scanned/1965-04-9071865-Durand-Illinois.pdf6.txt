M/SL SPOKE WITH DR. "AMERICAN METEOR SOCIETY, 
IN NARBERTH, PA REGARDING ANY METEOR OBSERVATIONS HE HAD ON RECORD FOR 15 APR, 01.302. 
HE SAID HE HAD A VERY POOR OBSERVATION REPORT FROM

IT WAS A REPORT OF A UFO THAT I SAW 15 APRIL AS 15.35P OF DURAND, ILLINOIS. THOUGH IT 
IT WAS A METEOR THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A JET . . . FLYING VERY SLOW . . . AS IT 
CLEARED SOME TREES SAW JETS OF FLAME IN THE EASTERN SKY . . . DARK AREA IN FRONT
OF FIRE. I SAID FOR ABOUT 3-5 SECONDS' OBJECT HAD FADED AS IT WENT BACK OF 
A WOODED AREA. Observation of meteor was low in the Eastern Sky. Dr. said this 
was a meteor observation from all information contained in her letter.
Her letter also contained a sketch of the meteor. He said it wasn't a good
sketch but shown when people who are not familiar with this type of observation
do not make very good reports and sketches. said that he would send
this report to us for reproduction and then we could return it to him, there was 
no hurry in returning it though, he said usually he does not received
reports for several months after an observation was made. said the letter from 
Mrs. English was not dated, he said the date of the letter is helpful a lot of
times and just doesn't understand why some people don't date their letters.
