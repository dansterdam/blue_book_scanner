The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn diagram. The diagram appears to be a compass rose with directional indicators and some sketches of an object's path. There is also some text describing the drawing instructions.

As for the text content in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you saw a UFO showing. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

This aircraft have BEEN A SINGLE object with A SERIEG different PATTERNS OF MOVEMENTS, AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING VARIOUS LANDMARKS IN THE AREA.
