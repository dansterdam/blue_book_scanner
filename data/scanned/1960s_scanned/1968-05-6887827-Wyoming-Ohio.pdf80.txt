Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

Thank you for your letter of July 10, inquiring about the whereabouts of two sightings of one of our airships was in the area of Dayton, Ohio, on that date.

One was the Star Aerostar, which was in Rochester, N.Y.

The other was in Dayton from approximately May 7 through May 15, but neither has been in this area since.

It would appear, then, that we cannot be of assistance in helping you to close up the matter of this sighting.

Sincerely,

(Signature)
