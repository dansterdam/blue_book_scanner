The image contains no photograph, but rather hand-drawn diagrams and illustrations related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting report. The illustrations show the observed positions of the object over time and provide instructions for how to draw the motion of the object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the same curved line to show where the object was when you first saw it. Place a "Y" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
