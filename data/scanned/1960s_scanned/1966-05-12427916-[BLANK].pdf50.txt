Today, numerous unofficial organizations exist which collect information and publish news on UFO sightings. Many of these groups allege that the Air Force is not revealing all of the truth about unidentified flying objects. No evidence of such concealment has been developed. However, to strengthen its investigatory capability, the Air Force has announced that a new "blue ribbon" panel of scientists has been appointed to conduct an independent, comprehensive study of data pertaining to sightings that so far have been denoted as "Unidentified."
