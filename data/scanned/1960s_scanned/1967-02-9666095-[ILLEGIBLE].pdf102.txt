AN ENCOUNTER 
Originally I/concluded that this most powerful nation had nothing that equalled the obvious power of the object and that the Atomic Age was going to be discovered over to discover for not going to be by wild scrambles, but rather by perhaps, the United States and other national governments already what I have found out, but if they do not being published. 
On my return home I was busy with family so out much the first two weeks of August. But I a couple of new publications about UFOs, one of which stated that the occupants and the other which stated that the occupants were from outer space. I tried to analyze the first of meetings which people on earth had had and decided that they would be more like the loving creatures described by acknowledged experts in religion-science com unications. So it was near mid September first near meeting came. I had gone to a remote walked from my car to a huge unused pasture beyond the bluff. A UFO which hung in front of it could come towards my peripheral vision caught eight of the tiny red lights down amid trees on the far side of the pond not where I was parked. I was apprehension and I didn't want to distinguish the pond while the night insects star din like I'd never before heard. This was one that deeper than apprehension and I didn't want to panic.
