AT WALLOPS STATION, VA., ONE OF AMERICA'S NASA ROCKET LAUNCHING STATIONS, DEMPSEY BURTON, DESCRIBED IT AS A BRIGHT OBJECT SHOOTING UP FROM THE SOUTH ON JANUARY 5TH, 1965. DEMPSEY BURTON STATES THAT THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECT LOOKED LIKE AN OVER-SIZED COMET AS IT STREAKED ACROSS THE SKY, BUT NEITHER HE NOR HIS ASSISTANT WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE OBJECT. FINALLY, WE HAVE A REPORT FROM STAUNTON -  SCENE OF SEVERAL INCIDENTS - FROM WHICH TITLE 7, RESEARCH PROBLEMS NO. 6, REPORT FOR FEBRUARY 1965, YOU FIND WHAT IT IS WORTH. STEVEN HOFFER, 16, WAS DRIVING ON U.S. ROUTE 250, BETWEEN STAUNTON AND CHURCHVILLE, WHEN HIS CAR SUDDENLY WENT OUT OF CONTROL AND TURNED OVER. STEVEN EXPLAINS THAT HE SWERVED TO AVOID A BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE ROAD, AND THAT HE BELIEVES THE OBJECT AFFECTED HIS CAR'S ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, CAUSING HIM TO LOSE CONTROL. THERE WERE NO INJURIES.

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA, CONTACTED LOCAL POLICE AND NEWSPAPERS CONCERNING FLASHING LIGHTS IN THE SKY OVER ANCHORAGE ON JANUARY 27TH. DR. WILLIAM C. LIVINGSTON, PROJECT SCIENTIST OF THE KITT PEAK NATIONAL OBSERVATORY, INVESTIGATED THIS INCIDENT AND CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS "NO MORE THAN ANYTHING I'VE SEEN BEFORE." THE LIGHTS WERE APPARENTLY AN AURORA BOREALIS DISPLAY, WHICH IS NOT AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE IN ALASKA, AND THERE WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THE RANGE OF OUR RADAR, ACCORDING TO AN AIR FORCE SPOKESMAN, WHO SAID THAT THIS WAS THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S INCIDENT IN ANCHORAGE.

RAY OF ANCHORAGE, ALASKA, WAS SITTING IN HER LIVING ROOM WITH THE FAMILY WHEN THEY ALL SUDDENLY LOOKED UP AND OBSERVED A STRANGE LIGHT OUTSIDE. WITHIN A FEW SECONDS, THE LIGHT TURNED INTO AN EXPLOSION A FEW SECONDS LATER. THE WHOLE FAMILY OBSERVED THE STRANGE INCIDENT, AND THE OBJECT THAT CAUSED THE EXPLOSION APPEARED TO BE LANDING ON THE GROUND A FEW MOMENTS. JUST PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION, RAY STATES THAT THE LIVING ROOM WAS FILLED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT.
