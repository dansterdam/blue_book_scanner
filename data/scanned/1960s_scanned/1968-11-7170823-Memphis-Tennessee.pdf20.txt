FINALLY, WHAT IS YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

Blew out of the car and soared as an after thought the color was a silvery metallic like a stange of thin palls which you could see through was what it appeared to be. I watched it all the time in a straight line and parts started falling off and became a strange, dull appearance of what it was.

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It kept going in a straight line and petered out something like a cloud, not remembering it went through that but thought it was gone.

THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING?
No it did not.
