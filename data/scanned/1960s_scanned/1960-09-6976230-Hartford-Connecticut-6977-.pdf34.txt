Case 6976230
Hartford, Connecticut
6 September 1960

On the evening of 6 September 1960, while driving home along Oak Street in the Wethersfield section of Hartford, Connecticut, the witness observed a glowing object, circular in shape, hovering above some trees approximately 1/2 mile away.

The object was first observed at around 9:50 PM while the witness was stopped at a red traffic light. It appeared to be approximately 20-30 feet in diameter and was glowing with a bright, white light. The object was completely silent and remained stationary for about 1-2 minutes before ascending vertically at a high rate of speed and disappearing from view.

The witness immediately pulled over to the side of the road and continued to observe the area for several minutes, but did not see the object return. He described the object as having a definite circular shape with no markings or details visible.

The weather at the time was clear with a few scattered clouds. No other witnesses were reported. The Air Force was notified and the case was investigated as part of Project Blue Book. No satisfactory explanation could be determined for the sighting.
