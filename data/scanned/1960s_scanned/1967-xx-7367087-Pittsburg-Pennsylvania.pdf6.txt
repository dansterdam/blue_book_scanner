AUG 18 1967

Dear Mr. _________:

This is in replies to your recent letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object on July 26, 1967.

Your observations revealed that on that date an object approximately 9:30 p.m. E.D.T., over Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, would have been on an azimuth of 275 degrees, at an elevation of 10 degrees, according to American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac 1967. Venus was a very bright object in the sky at that time of the year.

You also mentioned that when viewed with binoculars the object appeared fuzzy or blurred. This is often how celestial objects appear through binoculars.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

BARNETT B. YOUNG
