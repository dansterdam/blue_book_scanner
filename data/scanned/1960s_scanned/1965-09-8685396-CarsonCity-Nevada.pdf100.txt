"Saucers" Fly Pattern

Hayden, Idaho (AP)-- "Saucers" flew over our planet? Wouldn't you say they were drawn against our darkened nighttime skies, swooping to and fro, disappearing and reappearing without any visible noise?

With that, Hayden Hewes, Oklahoma City investigator, has been studying the curious phenomena of sightings of round flying objects. He says he has heard such reports for years.

Hewes went without sleep for two nights, he said, in making a check at patrol's headquarters in Edmond, Okla., seeking further clues on one that had been reported sighted over Oklahoma City and nearby towns.

A motion picture and a television newscast were made of this, Hewes said, and "it was unbelievable, less than 1,000 feet from the ground and a television camera couldn't get a clear focus on it."

"It was something like a quarter of the size of the moon and it would take off and everything would be obliviated," he said. "You could see it, then it would be gone."

Hewes, who has had some 2,500 reported sightings from Oklahoma and adjoining states by various law enforcement agencies of "flying saucers," said he can't explain what they are.

"They have been reported hovering, taking off at tremendous speeds, making right angle turns, splitting into two or three objects, going down to the ground and getting back up into the air again," he said.

"I believe there is something out there which to the best of my knowledge we don't fully understand."

Hewes said, however, he leans more toward the spaceman theory than the weather balloon or any other possible explanation at the present time."
