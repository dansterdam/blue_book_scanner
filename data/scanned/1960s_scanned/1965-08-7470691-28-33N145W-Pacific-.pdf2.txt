TO: AFSC (FTDR)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. The following is a summary of UFO activity in the Hawaii area during the period 2 August to 5 August 1965. This period saw an increase in UFO sightings and reports in Hawaii resulting in increased reporting and activity.

a. On 3 August, 06002 (3/2000 local), a family 1 in Wahiawa Beach reported a bright light moving across the sky at high altitudes and on various headings. The light appeared to change colors from red to blue. It moved from a position approximately 3 miles off Wahiawa and across the sky for a distance of approximately 50 miles. It was one of the brightest lights ever reported, even though they are frequently reported in this particular area. I consider the sighting to be of significance.

b. On 4 August, 06442 (3/2044 local), numerous sightings were made of an object which fell from the sky over Kahuku. The object was first observed at 31,000' on the 2030 radial 130 NM out Honolulu. As it fell it accelerated and it burned a brilliant white color even though there was no visible trail or plume. The object impacted on the ground and a flash and fireball were observed. Search was made but no debris could be found.
