This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document or report related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page discusses the following:

R^turn to preceding paragraph before insert A
I gave a copy of Vallee's book and also the Menzel letter which he took home and by the next morning had read completely the manuscript and the letter. LaPaz is still very concerned about the green fireball incident.
Another one was sighted this last Christmas night. According to LaPaz, the official investigation never satisfactorily cleared up the question of why these peculiar uranium green fireballs should have chosen New Mexico to fly over and avoid being seen in other states and why they were so peculiarly grouped. LaPaz is thoroughly convinced that both the green fireballs and Zamora's sightings were observations of advanced vehicles being produced by some project, even more secret than the Manhattan Project.
I am afraid that LaPaz is unshakable from this hypothesis, and his primary criticism of Vallee's book was that Vallee has ignored the green fireballs within, as far as LaPaz is concerned, represent the most important part of the UFO phenomenon. It is always just a matter of viewpoint!
LaPaz showed me his excellent meteorite collection and spent much time in general conversation.
He was engaged for the evening, and we met again early the next morning during which time we took the opportunity for meeting with the President of the University of New Mexico, Dr. Popejoy, and established good ----relations between astronomy at Northwestern and astronomy at New Mexico.
