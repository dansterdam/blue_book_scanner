The image does not contain any photographs, only a diagram and text. The diagram shows a sketch of the horizon, with angular measurements and a compass rose. The text asks the reader to imagine a scenario where an object is observed above the horizon, and to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
