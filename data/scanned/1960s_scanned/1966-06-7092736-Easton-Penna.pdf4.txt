The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will now perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text and provide the output:

I've been interested in the UFO era for about three years now and surely there must be something to it all. What I mean is that the sightings made by respectable citizens and even police and law officials should be enough evidence to prove that these things are some sort of spacecraft.

Thank you for your acknowledgement.

A believer,

P.S. excuse the weird looking

Are there any really convincing sightings that make the air force seem to accept the possibility of extra-terrestrial. I didn't think so.
