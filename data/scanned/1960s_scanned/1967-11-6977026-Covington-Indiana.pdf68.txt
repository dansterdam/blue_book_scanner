ACCOUNT OF SIGHTING

On 6 November 1967, at approximately 5:50 p.m., Mr. Mitchell, a resident of Covington, Indiana, sighted an unidentified flying object (UFO) over a field near his home. The object was described as being oval in shape, silver in color, and approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter. It was observed hovering for several minutes at an estimated altitude of 1,500 to 2,000 feet, before rapidly ascending and disappearing from view. No sound was reported to be associated with the object. 

Mr. Mitchell immediately contacted the local Sheriff's office to report the sighting. An investigation was subsequently conducted by the Air Force's Project Blue Book, which is responsible for the evaluation of reported UFO incidents.
