Dear Sir:

Attached is a rough sketch of what I saw in the sky recently. I understand this to me a so-called "flying saucer", as it appeared almost perpendicular to the horizon. This particular object was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, and made no noise whatsoever, as to whether it was manned or not I cannot say.

There was some debate going on among the witnesses as to what it could be. One man claimed it to be a jet plane and another said it was the planet Saturn. However, I have studied aircraft and celestial bodies enough to know that it could have been neither a jet nor the planet Saturn.

I have drawn a rough sketch and filled in all the details to the best of my ability, as I write this on the evening of May 24, 1963.

Respectfully yours,
(Mrs.)
