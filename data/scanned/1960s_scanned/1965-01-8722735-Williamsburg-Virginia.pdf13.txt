The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document page from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during the mid-20th century.

Text from the document:

"Williamsburg, Virginia, January 22, 1965. Two Richmond men reported seeing a bright, round, reddish-orange object hovering over a field near Williamsburg, Va., on the evening of January 22, 1965. The object was observed for about 10 minutes before disappearing suddenly at a high rate of speed. No further details."

"WITNESS' COMMENTS: Witness are requesting a follow-up investigation. Based on their report, this may be of interest to the investigative group that is studying UFO's and determining if there are any patterns or significant data to be obtained from sightings in this area."

"AGENCY DAILY, INTELLIGENCE: Sightings are continuing of UFO's in several areas of the country with some degree of regularity. There have been no major changes from earlier recurrences on the ground, however, that would suggest any immediate threat to national defense. (C)"
