Reference the attached letter from this office requesting information regarding observations. The first observation of August 1965 is very similar to an observation of 10 September 1950. The color of the lights, slow speed, and size appear to be the same type of observation. The noise is caused by a generator used in operating the equipment. The second sighting of 1 September was caused by test aircraft at high altitude as this office suggests.
