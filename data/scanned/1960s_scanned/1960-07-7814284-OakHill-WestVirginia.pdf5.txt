Mysterious Objects Seen In West Virginia's Skies
What were these mysterious objects seen over Oak Hill, West Virginia on July 7?
Shortly after 9:30 p.m., Mrs. Ellison, her children, and Mrs. Wilson and her children saw several strange objects in the sky. The objects were spotted shortly after a Titan missile was fired from a nearby air force base. The objects maneuvered and changed direction rapidly and were seen for about 15 minutes. 
Bill Napier, of Whipple, who was on the porch of his home, also witnessed the objects. He stated that they appeared to be about 300 feet in diameter, were a reddish-orange color, and moved in a zigzag pattern.
Mrs. Ellison, who first spotted the objects, said they appeared to be satellite-like, but were moving in an erratic manner. She lost sight of them when they went behind some trees.
The Air Force investigated the sightings, but could not identify the objects. All 7 eyewitnesses firmly stated that the objects were not airplanes, satellites, or any known aircraft. The Air Force is continuing its investigation.
