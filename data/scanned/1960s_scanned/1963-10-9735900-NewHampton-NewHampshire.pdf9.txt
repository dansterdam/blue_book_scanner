REPLY TO
UFO Sighting (Near Hampton, New Hampshire)

A. UFO SIGHTING (Mrs Gaiser)
VRAN 22 DCO

1. The following information is provided to assist you in a reply to Mrs. Gaiser's letter.

2. A letter was received from Mrs. Gaiser on 14 October 1963 with several bits of information concerning a UFO sighting which she reported to the Air Force Base at Pease, N.H. on 23 September 1963.

3. In her letter she indicates various inconsistencies in the information that he has provided.

4. An investigation was made of the report and of the possible solutions to the sighting in which the objects were described as being similar to balloons. This is the best explanation which can be offered at this time based on the information provided.

5. In his letter he indicates a speed greater than 600 MPH. In this connection, it is noted that the speed as estimated by the observer was approximately 600 MPH. This speed that she reports would be consistent with the possibility that the objects were aircraft. The objects were observed for only a short time and the distance traveled as estimated by the observer would account for the high speed reported.

6. The sighting has been placed in the "Other (Confirmed Date)" category and carries this evaluation. It is a possible solution based on the information provided.

7. The reported time of the sighting (2107PST) was approximately 2.5 hours.

8. Accepting the above assumptions the case could be evaluated as follows: the initial detection would be consistent with aircraft and the flight path and speed would be consistent with aircraft at that altitude.
