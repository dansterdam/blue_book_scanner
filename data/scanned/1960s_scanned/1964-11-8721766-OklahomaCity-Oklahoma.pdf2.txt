Dear Hayden,

This is in reply to your letter of 26 December 1964. We received the Ray Stanford duplicate picture which you forwarded to Chicago, Illinois for duplication by Kodak and returned to us. The original film was sent to you previously. 1 February 1965. My analysis of the Rand Stanford film depicts an independent evaluation of the objects which appeared on the 12th. The images on the Ray Stanford film depict a different incident, glowing the intensity in an independent evaluation.

J Allen Hynek has also evaluated the movie and he has determined the image to be the same. We appreciate your forwarding this film.

Regarding the fragments which you sent us on 9 November 1964. This arrived several weeks ago. There was an amount of postage due and we did not receive this object until December. We submitted the fragments to ASD for chemical analysis and the report indicated that the particles appeared to be common to that portion of Oklahoma. A copy of the analysis is enclosed.

It appears that nothing unusual contained within the object. I would like to reiterate our thanks for your obtaining the fragments from this location. It would seem that careful observation of the sound would indicate that the impact point would be in excess of 300 miles from the point of observation.

The fact sheet is in the process of being printed. A courtesy copy will be forwarded to you upon completion. We are investigating this matter which is included as one of our case histories.

Sincerely,
