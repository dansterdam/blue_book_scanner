Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This is in reply to your report of aerial objects which you observed on the night of 25 July 1965.

Your report is similar to the many reports in our files of unidentified aerial phenomena. These objects, which have been called UFOs, are often descriptions of natural phenomena, such as aircraft reflecting the sun, the planet Venus, meteors, and the like. In a small percentage of cases, the objects remain unidentified after investigation. This is not surprising since it is difficult to identify an object satisfactorily when the observation is of brief duration or under poor visibility conditions.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
