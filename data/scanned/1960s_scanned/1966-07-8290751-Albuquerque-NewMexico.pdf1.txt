PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 12 JULY 66 / 2352 
2. LOCATION: Albuquerque, New Mexico
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2-3 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
7. COURSE: SW
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer watched a star like object then later a long shaped object travel toward the SW. The first object left a trail and the second nothing. In both cases the object was very high and going SW. The object disappeared slowly in the SW.
The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. It is actually difficult to determine how long the object was visible, from the description it appears that two objects were observed instead of one as reported. If this is the case there is no indication as to how long each was visible.
