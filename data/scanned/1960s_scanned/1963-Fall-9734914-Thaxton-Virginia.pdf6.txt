Your observation of floating thistle blooms is indeed an interesting case and is falls into the general category of evaluations of reported "angel hair".

Similar observations which have been reported on many occasions included migrating spider web, rayon residue from broken down articles of clothing, and natural phenomena which appear to descend from the sky and vanish. The appearance which you described in your sighting during the latter part of 1963. 

The Air Force appreciates your contribution to this program and will this contribution to the various studies of unidentified flying objects.

Also, it is unusual for most private citizens to have a feeling for the complexities and difficulties of the occasional UFO reports. Again, this is just one of the many problems which confront the Air Force in evaluating and processing UFO reports. Again, we appreciate your interest and contribution.

Sincerely,

FOR THE COMMANDER
