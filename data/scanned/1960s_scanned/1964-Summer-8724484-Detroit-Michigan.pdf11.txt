Cleveland, Ohio. June 9, 1964, 3:00 A.M. The object, according to Donald Keyhoe, Jr., from the defense zone (see his previous descriptions as quoted) was oblong, brilliant, almost blinding, and hovered very low. The very fact the witness thought it was a meteor but soon decided that impression was mistaken lends credence to his story.

The object emitted no sound, was no larger than a small, trail of exhaust or tail structure. Keyhoe and Van Tassel approached it, but it showed no reaction to their approach - never touched down. On the third sighting, June 9, 1964, Time: 0300 (A.M.) Observers: Donald Keyhoe, Jr., and Nathan A. Van Tassel.

Miss Ventura and Keyhoe investigated the area thoroughly. They found signs on the ground where a landing or hovering had occurred. This was done before they called the authorities.

Miss Ventura and the Brooklyn police: they in turn referred the case to the Air Force. The Air Force in turn referred the case to the same Brooklyn police on the next day. Someone else answered and she was asked to repeat the sighting. She again described what she had seen.

That evening Miss Ventura received a telephone call from the Cleveland Main Dealer. The man wanted further details, she refused, as she had met with Air Force officers. The newspaper clipping contained here is the result - The Force contained her story and she hasn't had anything further occur since.

The Universal Metaphysical Society heard of it through the press and investigated the case, getting tape recordings to the press. Miss Ventura is a laboratory technician at Polyclinic Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. Keyhoe is a landscaper.
