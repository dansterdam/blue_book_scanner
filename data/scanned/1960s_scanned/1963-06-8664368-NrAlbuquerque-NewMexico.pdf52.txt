details regarding their sighting of a 
UFO at Shapury, England on June 2,

The details of the sighting are as

on June 2, 1963, Mr. and Mrs. H. C. 
were in their backyard when they 
observed a bright light in the sky. 
They watched the light for about 10-
15 minutes. The light appeared to be 
stationary at first, then it began to 
move. As it moved, it appeared to 
change shape from round to elliptical.

times. The light then disappeared 
from view. Mr. and Mrs. H. C. stated 
that the light did not appear to be an
aircraft, satellite, or any other known
