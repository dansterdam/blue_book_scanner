My report on the object which i saw on November 1, 1968 is as follows:

I was driving east on Highway 38 about 1 1/2 miles west of Kawanna, Indiana, on November 1, 1968. It was about 8:00 p.m. and the night was clear. I suddenly observed a bright light in the sky in front of me and to the right. The light appeared to be stationary or hovering at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. As I watched, the light began to move and gained altitude rapidly. It was traveling in a westerly direction. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape and emitted a bright white light. The light was not blinking or flashing. The object went out of sight in less than a minute. I stopped my car and watched it until it disappeared completely. I'd estimate the object was traveling at a speed of 500-1,000 mph. I could not hear any sound from the object. The size of the object was difficult to estimate due to the distance, but I would guess it was about 50 feet in diameter. I was very excited after seeing this object and had a difficult time driving the rest of the way home. I feel that what I saw was some type of unidentified flying object, possibly a spacecraft of some kind. There were no other witnesses that I'm aware of. I hope this description of what I saw is helpful. Please let me know if you need any additional information from me.
