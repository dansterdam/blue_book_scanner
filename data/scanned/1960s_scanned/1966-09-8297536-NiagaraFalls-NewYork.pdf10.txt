EVALUATION REPORT

ANALYSIS OF IGNEOUS ROCK

REPORT NO: NIA 67-10      DATE: 3 March 1967
PROJECT NO: 7381         TYPE EVALUATION: Analysis
MANUFACTURER:            SPEC NO:
SUBMITTED BY: Capt. Bowen   ITEM SERIAL NO:

I. PURPOSE:
Analysis of an igneous rock-like sample.

II. FACTUAL DATA:
1. The fused sample was submitted to MAAD to determine the material's composition and identify the alloy.
2. A spectrographic analysis of the material showed it to be alpha ferric oxide (Fe2O3).

III. CONCLUSION:
Since the spectrographic analysis of the sample did not reveal an established alloy system, no apparent source or use for this material could be determined from the composition.

IV. RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
