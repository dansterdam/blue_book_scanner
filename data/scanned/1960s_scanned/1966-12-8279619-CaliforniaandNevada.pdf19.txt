Dear Larry,

This is a mimeographed version and article on UFO's handed to me by a person who claims he got it from a source in a military base on Dec 60 [?], and to verify. All the information on this article is not new to me.

At GGT 13 contacted some people who claimed UFO was hovering about 30 feet from the ground, one large - red light in the middle, circular shape with a slight haze all around it. It remained stationary for about 2 minutes and then suddenly shot upwards at a terrific speed and disappeared. This was witnessed by [illegible] 4 persons and they were excited and thrilled.

The seds of these, one the same and the other different. Both landed to take samples and observation. Tried the whole some soil but analysis revealed nothing unusual. Radiation was normal.
