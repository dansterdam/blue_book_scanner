1. Reference the attached letter from SPADATS giving an unidentified flying object sighting. Based on the information given, it appears to be a satellite decay.
2. A week with SPADATS shows that this is a regular occurrence. The report from NORAD indicated the passage of a satellite through the atmosphere. The attached SPADATS report confirms this observatory.
Although SPADATS records show an object was detected and his crew has all the characteristics, the information has little operational significance.
