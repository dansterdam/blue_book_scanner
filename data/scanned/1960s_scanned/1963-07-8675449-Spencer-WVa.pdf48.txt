"Path of Totality
To make the many scientific observations made possible by a total solar eclipse, observers are taken to various points along the path of totality. They have selected locations that offer the most favorable circumstances for their observations. This path, which will be about 140 miles wide, extends from the west coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands across Canada to Maine, and then into the Atlantic Ocean.

Along this path, the sun is completely covered by the moon for a short period of time, ranging from about 35 seconds in Northern Canada to as much as 2 minutes and 20 seconds in the ocean off the coast of West Africa. The area outside the path of totality will only experience a partial eclipse, with the moon covering only a part of the sun.

To view the total eclipse, observers must be within the path of totality. If you are in the path in Maine, and it is cloudy, you may miss the eclipse. If you are outside the path, you will not see the total eclipse, only the partial eclipse.

The sun's corona, or outer atmosphere, is visible only during a total eclipse. It is a beautiful sight, extending millions of miles into space. The corona has a ghostly, feathery appearance, with streamers of light emanating from the sun in various directions. The inner part of the corona appears bright and vapoury, gradually becoming more filamentary and diffuse with increasing distance from the sun.

Photograph of Eclipse
For a successful eclipse photograph, the camera must be precisely aimed and focused on the sun during the brief period of totality. Special filters are required to photograph the corona and prominences. The total eclipse is also an opportunity to photograph the stars and planets near the sun, which are normally obscured by the sun's light.

Numerous astronomical and scientific observations are made during a total eclipse, ranging from precise measurements of the shape and size of the moon's shadow to studies of the sun's outer atmosphere. The data collected contributes to our understanding of the sun and solar system.

The next total solar eclipse visible from the United States will occur on July 2, 1973. The path of totality will cross the northwestern states and continue across Canada. After that, the next total solar eclipse visible from the United States will be on February 26, 1979, with the path of totality crossing the northwestern states and continuing into Canada."
