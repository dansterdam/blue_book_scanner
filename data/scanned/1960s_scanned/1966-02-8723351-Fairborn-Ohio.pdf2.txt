MEMO FOR THE RECORD: CALL FROM REGARDING OBSERVATION ON SUNDAY 20 FEBRUARY 1966.
Regarding his observation of 20 Feb 66. at 1:10 p.m. Object was going terribly fast. Illusionary thing. Couldn't judge height. Appeared to be a cannon falling off and towards earth then the thing level out and flew away. At first he thought the object was going to either fall in his back yard or his neighbor's back yard. Dark blinking black exhaust changing to white, one second pulsating. Came from north almost going directly south. Couldn't identify, object had a funny way of controlling itself. It was like it was intelligently controlled. Weather was clear. Wind was going same directions object. Thought at first they were experimenting from the field (WPAFB). He called the television station and said that he would verify an unidentified object if anyone else saw one.
He has a book on flying saucers by Adamski and in this book there is a picture like the one he saw. He was asked that we not reveal his name. He replied that no names are given out.
A Form 164 was sent to on 3 Mar 66.
