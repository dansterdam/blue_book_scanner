This image appears to contain two sketches or illustrations related to a UFO sighting.

The first sketch shows a compass rose-like diagram with various cardinal and ordinal directions labeled. The instructions indicate that this diagram is meant to be used to indicate the direction of the observed UFO phenomenon.

The second sketch shows two landscape scenes. The larger scene depicts a person standing on a road or path between hills or mountains in the distance. The smaller scene shows a similar landscape with a suggestion of something in the sky.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

"9A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "0" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO 
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "O" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "O" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATELY THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN THE TWO POSITIONS. THEN INDICATE GRAPHICALLY ANY CHANGE IN THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON AS IT WAS OBSERVED, IE: LARGER, SMALLER OR THE SAME."
