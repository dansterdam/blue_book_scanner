The text reads as follows:

UFO REPORT
MAYSVILLE, KENTUCKY
8 February 1963

On 8 February a man was returning from a shopping expedition in Maysville. He was driving along the road when he noticed another car parked on the opposite side of the road. As he approached the parked car, he noticed two light colored objects, one above the other, hovering over the car. As he drew closer, the objects began to move, went straight up, came together and moved off to the southwest. The man reported the sighting to the Air Force for investigation.

Subsequent investigation revealed that the objects reported in this incident could not be definitely identified. The description, size, color, and other factors precluded identifying them as any known aircraft. The incident was considered unsolved.

A check with the local police and sheriff's office in Maysville failed to reveal any other reports of unidentified flying objects in the area on the date of this incident. The Air Force was notified of the results of the investigation.
