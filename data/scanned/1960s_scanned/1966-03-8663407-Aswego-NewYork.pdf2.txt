On the night of March 4, 1966, two objects that were round in shape and giving off a bright bluish-white light, were observed at about 1900 hours for a period of about two hours by the writer and two flakes, away from school, one of our friends.

It is alleged that we who have means to verify the truth or authenticity of such matters, regard with two solid flashing lights, which seemed to be an aircraft. It was circular in shape, about the size of a penny, and disappeared over the roof of the house. It was in view for only a few seconds.
