The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed page from a report documenting a "Plymouth mystery" sighting. The text states that the object was seen in the area of Plymouth, and was spotted by personnel at the Meteorological Station at R.A.F. Mountbatten, who could not offer any explanation for the sighting. The report seems to be dated April 8, 1964.

PLYMOUTH MYSTERY
From the Western Morning News:
"A bright object was seen flying in the Mile-wide area of Plymouth Airport at 9:45 a.m. yesterday. The object appeared to hover in two before disappearing. The Meteorological Station at R.A.F. Mountbatten could offer no explanation." (Credit to Mr. D. Ward.)
