The image contains a photograph analysis report from Project Blue Book regarding an unidentified flying object sighting at Lake Tiorati, Bear Mountain State Park, New York on December 18, 1966. The report states that the photographic analysis has negated double exposure and/or re-touching, but no satisfactory explanation could be made of the unidentified object. The object appears to be circular in form, with a defined "superstructure." The analysis indicates the object to be substantially nearer than the background trees, and no attempt at "painting" was evidenced by the sharpness of the general scene. The report is signed by Douglas H. Rogers, Intelligence Research Specialist, and approved by William L. Turner, Chief, Photo Analysis Branch and Walter Price Jr., Chief, Photo Exploitation Division.
