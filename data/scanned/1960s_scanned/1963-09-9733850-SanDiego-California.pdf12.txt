The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page appears to be a description or report of some kind, but does not mention any specific photographs.

Observations and details, characterization unusual maneuvers and attitudes
are close to accurate in the following, but most in conversational
reported style and presented for the purpose of the official file we believe to be the actual occurrences, in some cases differing slightly from
present research, inasmuch as the events, while actually observed, were
related to us by the original source and have been thus revised and altered
slightly to what we believe to be the actual facts (some conflicting data the reason
for being passed over on the merits). It is however, the best we can give
you based on the sources now accessible. I must caution you, that I have
with all the details seen, oblique or-go-ing references pointing to and
reinforcement of a whole phenomenon of a continuing nature.
I mentioned the "flashing" in and of? before, well, this would of
course be one point where detail might be added to the recorded and
reported events. It is between 10 and 11 of the 12th, shutdown of a was
approx 1/2 was on again. The time between was short, shut-off a was
longer.
Later, these time, measurements, etc. will be more carefully
established to the extent's speed.
It was similar to that observed on 9
satellite in orbit. Should this be considered further? What observable?
I must withhold by calling these occurrences... as I may be unable to.
My suggested approximate time of 10:25 instead of 10:20 and on the previous
evening. It tends to be 25 minutes. How coincident? I can relate, however,
only the facts as reported to me, insofar as I have them, I cannot attest
to or vouch for accuracy or completeness.
