Narrative report by witness
Witness: James Gilliard, a resident of Donnybrook, North Dakota.  
On the night of August 6, 1966, I was driving home from the town of Donnybrook to my farm a few miles outside of town. It was around 10:30 pm and the sky was clear. As I was driving along the country road, I noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of me. At first I thought it might be an airplane, but as I got closer I could see that it was something much larger and brighter. The object was hovering over a field about a mile ahead of me. 
As I got closer, I could make out more details. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was giving off a bright, glowing light. It was making no sound at all. I slowed my car down to get a better look, but as soon as I did, the object suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view. 
I continued driving home, but I was quite shaken by what I had just seen. When I got home, I immediately contacted the local authorities to report the incident. They advised me to make a written statement, which I have done here.
