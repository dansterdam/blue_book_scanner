The image does not contain any photographs. However, it shows a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. 

The text from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? THE OBJECT APPEARED TO MOVE UP AND DOWN, DISAPPEAR THEN REAPPEAR BRIEFLY. IT APPEARED THAT THERE WERE SMALLER PORTIONS ATTACHED OR SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN OBJECT AS IT DID THIS, AND THESE SMALLER PORTIONS SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR OR SEPARATE COMPLETELY FROM THE MAIN OBJECT SLOWLY OR SUDDENLY.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?  Yes [X] No [ ] Don't know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes [X] No [ ] Don't know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Speed SLOW
b. Color GREENISH GLOW

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered? 1/400TH OF VIEWED AREA.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
[A hand-drawn sketch showing an irregularly shaped object with indistinct edges and appendages]
As can be seen in this approximate scaled sketch, the object appeared to have an irregular shape, some appended smaller portions, and a glow or hazy edges. There were no distinct features like wings or trailing effects visible to the observer.
