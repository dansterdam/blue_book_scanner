The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The diagram shows an illustration of an object in the sky, with the observer position marked as "A", and a compass rose showing the direction of the object's travel. There is also a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a propeller or radial engine.

The text in the document states:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" at the point to show how high the object was above the horizon (azimuth) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a sketch that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

From North to SE across the city

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
