11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS An object, or light, shaped first like plate, then like sphere, open convertible going north. Interestingly, witness drove home and called some other witnesses to observe, but it was
gone by that time. Witness said the object was rising and should have been visible but apparenfly it had blotted out or moved away from that location. Reliable witness report hypothesis is based on their failure to see the object, even though they tried.
