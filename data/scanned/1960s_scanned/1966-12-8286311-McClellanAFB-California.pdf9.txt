9:15 P.M.
Two objects appeared in the north, moving toward the south. They were of the same orange color as the earlier objects. There were about size of a dime held at arm's length and slowly visible when two more objects appeared low in the northern sky.

One by one these objects disappeared, over a period of 5 or 10 minutes. Almost immediately a 5th object appeared, moving more rapidly than the previous 4 objects. It climbed in a stepped manner, turned toward the west, and then began to "spark" - it flickered and disappeared. These five objects were first observed on 20 Dec, 1966.
