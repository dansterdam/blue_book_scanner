ATTN OPS TA-3 15 JANUARY 1961

SUBJECT: UFOs

TO: ATIC, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

1. Reports have been sightings of UFOs in the vicinity of Wichita Falls, Texas on 8 January 1961. This is in reference to reports received by this headquarters from all of these incidents.

2. The sighting of 9 January was made by Major Warren D. Aikan and Major Joseph C. McAndrew, both assigned from the 4756th Radar Squadron (SC), at Sheppard AFB, Texas (see Atch 1) along with two civilian observers. Details of the sighting have been reported to ATIC.

3. Reference my message of 15 January FAILSAFE concerning 10 January and the path of the object observed by 1st Lt. William Haller and Airman 1st Class William Lohren at Wichita Falls. It is now considered that the preparation by the crew of the NFG-1 was probably the result of a piece of rocket or satellite entering the atmosphere. No other sightings of significance occurred.

4. The 11 January sighting was reported by Mrs. T. as significant but investigation discloses that the light objects observed were probably stars in the night sky. Intelligent reports received from other observers indicate that she saw only the distant stars.

5. Mr. [redacted] was the programmer and weatherman for KNCT-TV, Wichita Falls, who reported he saw an unusual object in the southwest bright white lights as he drove from Huntsville, Oklahoma to Frederic, Oklahoma (see Atch 2).
