The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an additional investigation document. The document appears to be an analysis of a sighting report, likely related to a high-altitude balloon or unidentified flying object.

ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION
6 July 1966

Attached adiabatic chart received from U. S. Weather Bureau this date. The local weather officer, Major Paul T. Ulrich, was contacted to interpret the information for me. The following information was received from him:

"Assuming the balloon's ascension rate was 1000 feet per minute, the adiabatic chart indicates the balloon had the following flight path during the duration of flight indicated:

MINUTES DIRECTION ESTIMATED ESTIMATED 
OF FLIGHT OF FLIGHT GROUND SPEED ALTITUDE
1 290° 3.NMPH 1000 ft
2 320° 13 NMPH 2000 ft
3 010° 12 NMPH 3000 ft
4 030° 12 NMPH 4000 ft
5 070° 23 NMPH 5000 ft 

CONCLUSION:
The above information eliminates the possibility that the balloon was in the area of the UFO sighting by Mr.___. Since there apparently were no other local balloons released at this time, it appears that this possibility must be eliminated.
