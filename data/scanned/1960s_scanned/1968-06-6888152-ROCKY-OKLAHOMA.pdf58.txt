The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with text describing a conversation between two individuals, Hynek and someone else.

Text from the document:

No, it was not balloon or nothing like that. It was all lit up and there was noise first and then it split.
How close do you think it got to you?
I would say between 50 and 100 feet.
But there were no trees around so you could judge its actual distance.
No, there were no trees.
Yes, that's right. I have the pictures in front of me and it is pretty plain that there were not too many people. How many people did you tell about this?
We didn't tell nobody right then. After that we told quite a few.
Actually, we didn't tell nobody after that.
How long before you decided not to tell anybody?
The next day after that.
I am always interested in knowing what people think about these unidentified persons who have seen something like this. How did you happen to make the report in the first place?
We thought it was helicopters at first, from the Cannon Air Force Base so we called and they said there was no helicopters up then.
Did they say they had anything on radar?
No, they said there was no airplanes or nothing out that night.
What was the sky itself like, was it clear? Or, was it cloudy?
Clear, I believe.
Was the moon up?
Yes, there was some moon.
What part of the sky was the moon in?
I don't remember about that.
Well, was it high up or was it low down?
Fairly high.
Well, let me ask, was the moon in the same part of the sky as this object?
No, it wasn't.
And you were looking what -- west?
No, we were looking east. It came from the southeast.
