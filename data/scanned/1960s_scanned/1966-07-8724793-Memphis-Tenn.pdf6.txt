Gentlemen:

On July 27, 1966, at 0135 P.M., while driving on Interstate 55, approximately 20 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee, I observed an unidentified flying object. This object was approximately 200 feet from us, over the highway, at an upward angle of approximately 45 degrees. The object was observed for approximately 1 minute in great detail.

This object was approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, the major portion (being black), with one small red light on the upper left portion. The object appeared to be stationary and maintained this position. The elongated portion was a slightly smaller section of the object, which appeared to be a container from which a sound in shape. This sound appeared to be a glass-like "whooshing" sound, which seemed to have originated from the object.

After approximately 1 minute, the object emitted a light "blink", causing it to temporarily disappear from my view. The motor in my car seemed to be affected at the time, but I cannot state for certain that my car was affected, as I was preoccupied with observing the object. There was no sign of power, such as jets or propellers, and we could detect no noise from the object. We were unable to detect any sound from the object because of the wind noise and the fact that it appeared to be approximately 1 minute, this object left our immediate range of vision.
