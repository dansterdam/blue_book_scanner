Dear Major Coleman:

Your letter dated April 7, 1961, regarding sightings of white lights rotating on aircraft has been forwarded to this office.

APPROVED anti-collision lights required for night flight on all aircraft in accordance with Civil Air Regulations 14 CFR 03.30.

Special Civil Air Regulation 26-12-57 which is scheduled to become effective 1 April 1961 requires strobe lights to be installed on certain military and civil aircraft. Operators who do not comply with the relevant specific requirements of this regulation may be subject to enforcement action.

A number of different types of lights are being evaluated by the Bureau of Aviation Agency with appropriate CAA participation and MATS is actively engaged in testing various lights systems and equipment to produce a brilliant brilliant light. This type of light and one recently developed will be installed in the near future on aircraft where appropriate.

INCIDENT REPORTS of unidentified objects are handled in accordance with system presently in use. When reports are received in the field, the number and types of lights present are noted. Maintaining a current list of aircraft with unexplained lights would be impractical and of little real value.

If I can be of additional assistance, please advise.

Sincerely,
(Original Signed by)
J. H. Cunningham
Chief, Air Carrier Operations Branch
Directorate of Flight Standards
