BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a round ball of light that appeared about the size of a grapefruit at arm's length. The light was observed to have a pulsing or flashing effect. The light was noted in the north-northwest sky and appeared stationary at times. This object was observed for about 5 minutes.

A family in Worland reporting that they had launched a total of nine hot air balloons on the previous evening. This may explain the object observed.
