My wife and I sighted this "bulb" about the size of a basketball across the Bixby River. We watched it ascend and then proceed across the Bixby River bridge, at about treetop level, until it reached Banquin, Texas and then no further. We could see through it, a bright light inside, and it moved in an easterly direction at a very rapid pace. We were returning home to Timpson, Texas and the object first appeared while we were on the Lone Pine highway, close to the Timpson-Belleville road. We could see it complete the journey across the bridge and almost 9 miles further until it disappeared in the direction of Banquin, Texas. This happened about 5:25 p.m. on 5 Feb 1967.
