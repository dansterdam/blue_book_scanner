Navy Balloon Is What You May Have Seen That Night
Two Indiana Navy balloon and three other states a week ago last night were spotted by thousands of witnesses, an official Air Force announcement said last night.
Col. David H. Wood, Jr. US. Army, Detachment commander at Chanute Air Force Base, said two or four balloons released June 3 from a Manitoba Manitoba manoeuvre are missing or may not have been recovered.
"We can't determine if the missing balloons were the objects seen that night," Wood said, "not until we recover the packages and their serial numbers." 
He explained that upward wind patterns can change balloon drift before positive identification can be made.
The four balloons used in the manoeuvre are valued at $100-$500 each, he said. They normally operate at altitudes from 70,000 to 125,000 feet and are programmed.
