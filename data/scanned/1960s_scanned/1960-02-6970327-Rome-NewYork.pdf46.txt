"Source: Flying saucer - May 1960

Last Saturday, Feb 27, 1960, at 12:30 AM, I was driving along highway 69 when I sighted a bright light in the sky some distance in front of me. At first I thought it might be an airplane. As I got closer however, I realized it was not an airplane, for the light remained stationary and then it began to descend in a zig-zag fashion. When it was almost directly overhead, I stopped the car and observed it closely. It was circular in shape, perfectly silent, and had a bluish-white glow around the edge of the craft. The craft made a 360 degree turn and then began to ascend in a zig-zag fashion until it was out of sight. The whole incident lasted about 5 minutes.

I am a 23 year old male and I can assure you that this was no hoax or illusion. I have an excellent reputation in this community and I have no reason to fabricate such a story. I believe I have seen a genuine unidentified flying object. I hope you can make some sense of this for me.
