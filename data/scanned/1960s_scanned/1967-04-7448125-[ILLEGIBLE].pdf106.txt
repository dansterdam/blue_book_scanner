The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is an official U.S. government investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Proposed reply to letter from [REDACTED] dated 17 May 1969.

1. Reference your UFO sighting of 28 April 1967 from Williamansett, Massachusetts. On the basis of your description, listed duration and flight path of the object, your sighting is being carried as possible aircraft in Project Blue Book files. It is not unusual to be able to see an aircraft but not be able to hear any noise from the engines. Your inability to hear the engine noises may have been due in large part to upper-level winds.
