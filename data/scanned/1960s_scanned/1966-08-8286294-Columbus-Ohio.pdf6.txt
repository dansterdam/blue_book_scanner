The image appears to contain a scanned page from an old report related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). There is no photograph present on this particular page.

Performing OCR (optical character recognition) on the text in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
YES, IT STOOD THERE AND JUST VANISHED. NO SOUND, NO SMOKE, NO TRAILS. JUST DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) YES, it moved behind: SOME ICE BRUSE TREES.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) YES. IF you answered YES, then tell what:
IN FRONT OF.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound ABSOLUTELY SILENT, NO DISCERNIBLE SOUND.
b. Color WHITE - LIKE A LIGHTED PLANET.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
THE ENTIRE ROUND OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST OUT.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and specifically indicate the direction the object was moving.
A SKETCH IS PROVIDED SHOWING A ROUND CIRCULAR OBJECT UNDER A WEST - EAST MOVING TRAJECTORY.
