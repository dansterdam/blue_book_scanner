Dear Sir:

I regret Wednesday, the March 7, 1964, was the date I stopped around. I noticed the time was approximately 8:17 P.M. as I caught the show in a sudden brightness. The attention was immediately by a pair of parallel bright, steady lights flying south and north, a formation of 2 lights stop, A formation of lights were present for about 3 pairs of lights, each pair to the other, but motionless in the air. The little fly and no more motion on other motion outside the lights, seem that they were up high. To me they the lights.
