PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE-TIME GROUP: 9-10-66 0925Z
2. LOCATION: Canton, Ohio
3. WITNESSES: 3
10. CONCLUSION: Above (Sirits)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The light was observed to change colors from red, to blue, green and white. The color changes were distinctly observed. The object did not disappear while being watched. Intermittently it would fade and brighten, but it was never completely lost from sight. Its intensity was very bright and it did not resemble any normal or known aircraft configuration or lighting system. The description is consistent with that of an astronomical phenomenon. When such lights are low on the horizon, instillation is responsible for quite unusual displays.
