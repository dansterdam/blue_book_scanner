1. I find that there is not enough information to attempt a detailed analysis. I would appreciate through interrogation of the witness(es), but since the witness is a 12-year-old boy, my color on the estimate may still be questioned by the general public.

2. If you authorize it, I will be happy to make a phone call and attempt a further evaluation of the facts.

3. From the limited data at hand, a meteor explanation seems the most likely even though five seconds is too long a time to be consistent with such an explanation, and the contradictions with the relatively short arc covered in five seconds also seem to contradict such an explanation.

4. I would recommend that the phone call be made.
