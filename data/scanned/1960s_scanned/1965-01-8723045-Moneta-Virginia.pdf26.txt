AF IN: 27393 (27 JAN 65)
SEPARATE BY APPROXIMATELY 15 MILES. THIS INDICATES A POSSIBLE CONFIRMATION, ESPECIALLY SINCE ONE UFO WAS OBSERVED BY TWO PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME. HOWEVER, THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVE, CIGAR-SHAPED VERSUS A SQUARE AS LARGE AS A FOOTBALL FIELD, CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO CONFIRM EACH OTHER. SINCE ALL THREE WITNESSES ARE RELIABLE, I MUST JUDGE THAT SOMETHING WAS OBSERVED IN EACH CASE. THE WEATHER BALLOONS CITED IN PARAGRAPH 3 MIGHT FIT THE CIGAR DESCRIPTION, BUT
I OFFER THIS AS ONLY A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION. I CAN OFFER NOTHING MORE DEFINITE.
L. EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE.
NOTE: SEC 1 IS AF IN 27397 (27 JAN 65)
