The image contains a sketch of a horizon with a compass rose, but does not contain any photographs. The text on the page appears to be instructions and questions related to sketching and describing the motion of an unidentified object or objects observed in the sky.

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that shows how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve where you last saw the object.

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path, a "B" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
