14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Faded in sight

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: Faded in sight

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No. IF you answered YES, then tell what: Faded in sight

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound: No b. Color: red, yellow, flashing

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? all of it would be covered

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. Empty space
