The Richmond, Virginia Area reported sighting of an unidentified flying object at 1925 local time. This aircraft was similar in size to a very flight commercial DC-3 and could have been the same or alike, but the object was seen to have rapid acceleration and high altitude climb.

This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert R. Dechant, USAF. The description of this UFO was given by Mr. Taylor to Lieutenant Dechant as a complaint report.

The most probable cause of this sighting was confirmed to be a commercial airliner. This conclusion was based on an interrogation with the [redacted] control tower manager, who stated that a DC-3 was airborne in the area at that time.

Further possible causes of the sighting were an U.S. Army Tethered balloon at the [redacted] station, and the passage of a re-entry space object. However, these possibilities could not be confirmed.

A third possible cause of this sighting would be the sun reflecting on a distant aircraft, but this could not be confirmed.

This report would include an interview with witnesses, but this possibility was not pursued due to the lack of positive identification of the sighting.
