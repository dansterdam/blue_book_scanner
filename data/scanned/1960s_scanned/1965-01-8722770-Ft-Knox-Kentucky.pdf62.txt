Mystery Light
Report Made
At Lakehurst

On 27 December 1964 at about 1645 hours, a mysterious light was observed in the sky near Lakehurst, New Jersey, by two soldiers from the Nike Hercules Missile Site. The light was observed for about 15 seconds, and then disappeared. The light was described as being yellow-orange in color and flashing. It was moving at a high rate of speed, and slightly descending, when it disappeared. The light seemed to be slightly larger than a star, but smaller than the moon.

The two observers, Private First Class Amos and Private First Class Barnes, both of the 9th Missile Battalion, reported this observation to their site commander, who in turn reported it to the Combat Center at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. No other sightings were reported in the area at that time. The location of the observers was about 5 miles southwest of Lakehurst Naval Air Station.
