The image contains a photograph depicting a blurry, elongated object in the sky, which appears to be described in the text as a "match head" size object observed in front of a known object. The text below the image provides instructions for an experiment to estimate the size of the observed object.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE HELD A MATCH AT 23M'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A DISTANT SHIP OR CLIFF ETC. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOTE HOW SUCH OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED.
