As mayor, my office has thoroughly investigated the recent reports of an unidentified flying object in this area. Based on our investigation, I can state that there is no evidence to support these claims. The object sighted was likely an ordinary aircraft or weather phenomenon, and there is nothing to indicate the presence of any extraterrestrial activity. We will continue to monitor the situation, but at this time there is no cause for concern.
