ANOTHER LANDING IN CHILE: Again thanks to our South American editor, Mr. Von Hupel, we have another report of a landing in Llanquihue, Chile, and we were witnesses to this again on August 2nd in Llanquihue, Chile. This time the landing was observed by a large group of people, not just a few as in the previous case. The group was seen to be near the UFO when it landed. The witnesses claimed that the craft started to land after a group was seen to take off and by motion that they feinted. Some members fainted but as they did so, they said they saw the craft, but it disappeared when they recovered. Some round charred areas the size of approximately 4-1/2 meters were found around the craft, and it was reported that the ground had been charred and upturned.
