The image provided does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

All the information given was a tale. No real incident occurred here. The story was fabricated to obtain official recognition. The object described could be some weather balloons or routine type of parachute flares or similar phenomena, but it appeared in all respects to be of Unusual character, and people at the scene were convinced of its unusual nature.
Please delete this report. It will serve no useful purpose.
Advice I feel disposed to give on the moment, I will refrain from, as I feel sure my comments could not be of any real value.
Please cancel this report. It was written by someone who had some very definite opinions or notions, but certainly no substantial facts or evidence on which to base them. Disregard this report.
