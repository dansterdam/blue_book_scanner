UFO SIGHTING EAGLE RIVER
Wisconsin
27 April 1961

We are at the east edge of our farm residence about 12 miles east of Eagle River, Wisconsin. It was reported to me on Friday, April 27, 1961.
The first person to witness the sighting was Mrs. --------- at about 7:30 pm. And how old are you? Seventeen, sir.
What did you see when you first saw it? At first I didn't realize it was a flying saucer or an unidentified flying object, I thought it was a plane. I was just looking at it and then I saw the door close up. What time of day was this? This was about 25 or 30 till seven, and I noticed it had a funny light.
Was that during the evening? Yes, during the evening, I told Mrs. --------- and she looked. She didn't seem to believe me at first. I had to look again and call her and then I said "My God, look at that." She came over and she looked and she said "You're right, what is your family name?" I said "------.'' She said "Well, you want to see a flying saucer?" And I said "Yes," and she said "Well look there it is. Look at it. Look at it."
When she reported this sighting to you, what was your first reaction? I have seen them before and I almost knew it was one. But there it was, flight before us and we watched it for a short period of time, and it went over the house and said "Ma'am, you want to see a flying saucer?" And I said "Yes," and she said "Well look there it is. Look at it. Look at it."
