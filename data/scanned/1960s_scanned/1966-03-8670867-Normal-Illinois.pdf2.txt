1830 hrs CST:
This was when my young brother said, hey Steve, look at how low that plane is. I ran to the porch of the yard and watched it flying. I didn't think it was a plane, it was moving real slow. Actually it was the DG-3 flying over the city.

Interview with the Simpsons:
My wife and I were in back playing basketball when my young brother said, hey Steve look at how low that plane is. I ran to the porch of the yard and watched it flying. I didn't think it was a plane, it was moving real slow. Actually it was the DG-3 flying over the city. 

It flew a right hand pattern making a right base for landing at Bloomington Normal. Since there is not a tower, the DG-3 usually makes a pass to check the wind before they proceed on a downwind to base for landing. About 5 people called in and said they saw a UFO. Actually it was the DG-3 flying over the city.

Steve Simpson: Here, let me show you how it looked. (He obtained a copy of a dated "Coronet Magazine" and showed me a picture of a U-2, which was in reality a picture of a UFO, which was in reality nothing more than the DG-3 making a normal landing approach.)

The looking thing that got me was that it hovered over us looking to be maybe 3 to 4 hundred feet in the air. I'm sure the UFO was about a couple of hundred feet in the air.

Mrs Simpson: I saw the UFO above the tree top level. It had blinking lights, red, white and green. No, Steve, I didn't see it. The lights quit working when the object moved out of sight. I'd say we watched it for about 5 minutes.
