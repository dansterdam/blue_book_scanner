UFO SIGHTING

I. SUMMARY OF INCIDENT

On June 20, 1957, a private pilot named Harold opposed that while flying at an altitude of approximately 7,500 feet, he sighted an unusual object that appeared to be glowing. The object was described as round in shape and larger than a usual aircraft. It was traveling at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view within seconds.

II. OBJECTIVES OF PROJECT

The project has three objectives:
1. To determine if UFOs constitute a threat to our national security.
2. To determine if UFOs are interplanetary in origin or of a scientific nature.
3. To provide news media with information regarding the project and its results.

III. REPORT REQUESTED FROM INVESTIGATIVE OFFICER

The 1950-52 phase of the project has been completed. The report requested will provide a summary of the project's activities and findings to date, including any new developments or information that may have a bearing on the project's objectives.

APR 20 - A SPECIAL for the attention of the Commanding General is requested, as it is felt that when the final report is made, it will indicate the necessity for the continuance of this project.

As the final investigation will establish the true nature of the sightings, which will either confirm or deny the existence of UFOs, it is felt that the project should be continued until a definite conclusion can be reached.
