11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer watched a bullet-shaped object that disappeared toward the north. The object had a yellowish inside area changing to a reddish hue on the edges. No exhaust or propulsion was observed. It looked like it might have been shot out of something. The observer made an estimate that it was the thing the observers think of a meteor. However, the short duration prevented the observer from providing a more complete description of the object.
