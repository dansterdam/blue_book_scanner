DALLAS, TEXAS
In interview with witness, Capt. WALTER HAUT, 1st Sgt., R.C.M, AF, related the following:
On 6 April 1969 at approximately 2030 hrs., while driving west on Mockingbird Lane, he observed a large oval-shaped object hovering at an estimated 300 feet altitude and approximately 150 yards distant. The object was approximately 30 feet in diameter and appeared to be spinning or rotating in a clockwise direction. The object emitted a dull glow and was silent. After observing the object for approximately 2 minutes, it suddenly accelerated in a vertical direction and disappeared from view in less than 10 seconds. Capt. HAUT stated that during the time the object was observed, several other people on the street were also watching it.
