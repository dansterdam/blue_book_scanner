21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

Approx. 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a small airplane.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

About 1/2.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

Faded slowly, then object flashed different colors. Reappeared again, just the same as before.

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

At first subject thought of a magnesium flare - then object flashed different colors - regreened - just the same as before.
