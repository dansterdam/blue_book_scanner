Dear Mr. Bunkie,

The unidentified flying object observations which you reported to Air Force officials at Minot AFB, North Dakota have been studied. The objects described in your sighting do not appear to be aircraft or other celestial phenomena. The sighting indicates that the objects which you observed were astronomical and were discounted by observation personnel.

We are conducting a study of the many reports of this nature of which yours is one. You willingness to provide additional information to assist this investigation is appreciated. We are attaching an PID Form 164 and would appreciate your completing it and returning it in the envelope provided.

The Air Force appreciates your interest in this subject.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA JR, Major, USAF
