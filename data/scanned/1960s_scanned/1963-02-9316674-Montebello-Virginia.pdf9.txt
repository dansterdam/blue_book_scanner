U. S. SIGHTINGS (S).
January 4, 1963, Montebello, Virginia.
Moving object flying near Washington, D.C.
Was sighted by Capt. C. Chambers, Jr. at a little after 7:00 PM. It was a yellowish-white light, the size of a car, moving fast at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. John P. Campbell, reporter on the Williams-port Pa. (Sun-Gazette) , The FAA tower at Washington had confirmed the UFO sighting.
The UFO had a yellowish-white glow, and suddenly disappeared at a high rate of speed. About 15 minutes later, the object was sighted again, hovering low over Montebello, Va. and Charles W. Vest saw the same object on this second sighting.
It was about 10 minutes south of Washington, D.C., moving at a high rate of speed. A few minutes later, the witness saw the object again south of Washington.
Half a minute later, the witness saw the object again, this time at a lower altitude. At this point it was estimated to be traveling at a speed of about 1,000 mph (1,600 kph) during the fastest part of the observation.
The UFO was then lost from sight, and was not seen again.

February 1963: Special comments: I think that Case # 2 might be the same as observed in the southeast, but too far north-northeast to be the same object. It must have been a different phenomenon. Based on their shape and probable accounted for phenomena, I must child the intensity of the brightness of the reports. This will keep them on other members of the committee, and I seem to be in general agreement with you, except that, in general, our identification seems positive in our identification.
