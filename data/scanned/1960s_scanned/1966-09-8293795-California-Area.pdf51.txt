MAY 15 1957

Dear [redacted],

Thank you for reporting your recent completed UFO form for September 15, 1956 observation of an alleged unidentified flying object (UFO).

A study of the submitted information did not reveal a positive identification. The only explanation I can offer is that it was a distant high-altitude object, which is, of course, being only a possibility. USAF official policy is that unidentified aerial objects may be distant high-altitude objects, which, because of uncertain atmospheric conditions, appear at unusual size or as an unusual shape. Since aircraft records are normally destroyed after 30 days, it is impossible to check the records for any aircraft that may have been in the vicinity of your sighting.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
