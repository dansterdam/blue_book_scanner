The report states that the observer sighted two red flashing circles the size of two apples in formation side by side. Upon disappearance, there appeared to be two red lights like a rocket thrust above the horizon. The object made a level flight until ignition of the thrust, then glided downward. The probable cause of the sighting was the after glow and navigational lights of an aircraft which was airborne over the area at the time of the sighting.
