31. Describe completed information.
35. Information which you feel questions and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire.
I have a feeling, or rather a kind of impression of some kind, regarding the phenomenon, no solid or definite views, just a vaguely wondering over the possibilities. The observations were rather similar to previous reports of sightings, namely:
Appearance was bright, high speed, no wings or other structure visible, just a bright light. Movements erratic, fast, abrupt changes of direction and altitude, no sound. Seemed intelligently controlled, not like a natural object.
Observed for a rather short time, perhaps a minute or less, through a window. Distance could not be estimated accurately. Size was difficult to judge, but appeared no larger than a star, perhaps a little larger. Weather was clear, no clouds or haze. Other persons may have seen the same or similar objects at the same time, but I have no knowledge of this. Have heard of other reports in the general area, but do not know the details. No further data or clues which could be used to identify the object or its source. I have no special knowledge or qualifications which would enable me to analyze or interpret the observations. I have no theories or opinions to offer, other than the vague impression it was some kind of intelligently controlled device or craft, not a natural phenomena. That is about all I can say with reasonable confidence about the observations.
