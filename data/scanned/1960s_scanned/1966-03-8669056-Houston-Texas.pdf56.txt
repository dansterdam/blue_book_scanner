35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

At about 8:30 p.m. on March 25, 1966 I was driving in a southern direction on the Gulf Freeway near Houston, Texas. At that time as I glanced toward the north eastern sky, I noticed an object which appeared to be traveling in a horizontal pattern. The object was a whitish color and seemed to emit a pulsating or blinking light. It was considerably higher than a low flying plane and did not have the characteristics of an ordinary aircraft. The object appeared at a distance and seemed to gradually disappear over the horizon. After sighting this, I continued to watch the sky but did not see the object again. The sighting lasted approximately 1 to 2 minutes. The time was between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m.
