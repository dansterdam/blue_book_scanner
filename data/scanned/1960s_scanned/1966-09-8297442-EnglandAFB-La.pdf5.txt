BS DESCRIPTION OF COURSE OF OBJECT:
(1) OBSERVERS AIRCRAFT CAC-47 WAS ON THE FIRING RANGE STARTING TO MAKE A FIRING PASS AT A TARGET WHEN OBJECT APPEARED BETWEEN AIRCRAFT AND TARGET. OBJECT WAS BELOW AIRCRAFT ESTIMATED ABOUT 100 - 150 FEET OFF THE GROUND. TO ONE OBSERVER THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE HOVERING AT FIRST, AND THEN BEGAN TO MOVE UP TO A SPEED OF ABOUT 80 - 90 KTS. THE OBJECT MOVED FROM EAST TO WEST AND STARYED AT ABOUT THE SAME 100 - 150 FEET ALTITUDE. ONE OBSERVER PILOT/FLIGHT EXAMINER TOLD THE PILOT NOT TO FIRE BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING MOVING ON THE RANGE. HE THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRCRAFT AT FIRST, BUT COULD SEE NO LIGHTS ON IT. AS THEY APPROACHED CLOSER TO THE OBJECT HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE AN AIRCRAFT WITH A LARGE "NIMBUS" ON TOP. THE OBSERVERS AIRCRAFT WAS IN A LEFT TURN WHEN THE OBJECT PASSED DIRECTLY BELOW THEIR AIRCRAFT STILL MOVING EAST TO WEST AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF ABOUT 60 - 70 KTS.
