Transcription of the text:

"At 9:22 a.m. - 
A small object appear to be a cloud in the sky, rapidly descend
It seemed to be falling and vanished from view completely. We 
observed this for about 15 seconds. The object in the air was
triangular in shape and appeared to be a metallic or chrome-like
surface as it reflected the sunlight. The object descended 
vertically and the rapid descent and vanishing act was most
interesting. - Quite remarkable - very, the effect nearly
mystical, where a light having ball retracted.

P S Some of the meteorological observation that could
perhaps explain the phenomena."
