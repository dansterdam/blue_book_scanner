Dear Bob:

The following is a summary of similar conditions surrounding the visual and radar sightings near Vandenberg AFB base between 7:50 p.m. and midnight of October 6, 1967.

SOURCES OF DATA:
Radiosonde and wind data from - 
Vandenberg Air Force Base, San Nicholas Island, San Diego
Surface weather observations surrounding the time of sightings from -
Statue Martin, Vandenberg AFB, Oxnard AFB, Pt. Mugu, Santa Barbara, Long Beach, Bakersfield, March AFB

GENERAL WEATHER SITUATION:
In a troclling sequence which moved a trough along the west coast and a low pressure center northeastward from the area of Pt. Conception, a line of high pressure formed over the Great Basin and a range of cumulonimbus clouds developed south of the Tehachapi Mountains. Movement of the system was generally southeastward from the central coast. Near the center of this activity were the stations near the coast from Santa Barbara to Long Beach. Air masses between these stations and their air flow differed substantially and would have created a varying refraction pattern as their leading edge progressed.

This over-ocean flow of warm dry air, accounting an appreciating pattern of the various constant stations, it is possible to reconstruct an approximation pattern of the ground clutter echo of the warm dry conditions.
