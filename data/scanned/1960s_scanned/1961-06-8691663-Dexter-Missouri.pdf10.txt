24 August 1961

Dear ----,

I appreciate your letter of June 22. 1961, commenting upon a recent case that was reported in the news media. We have completed informal investigations of this case, and have found that there is no information to substantiate the claims that were made concerning it.

It appears that the multiple sightings reported originally were not confirmed by subsequent investigations.  Attention has been given to this case, and we are satisfied that there is no evidence to indicate the presence of any unusual aircraft.

Your interest in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM E. COLEMAN, JR.
