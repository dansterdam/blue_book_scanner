Describe Object: 
2 Area Men Report UFO
"I never saw anything like it before." 
Earl Reid Jr., of Montville, one of those who reported the sighting to the Montville Co-op, who saw an unidentified flying object said that it was shaped like a saucer, seemed to be the size of a large plane, and was very bright. He explained that he didn't think was much about it until he got to work. Then, several fellow employees, including his foreman, D. B. Hanchett, watched the object as it maneuvered in the sky.
Mr. Rathburn, 48, of Painesville Township Rt. 5, said he saw the object at the same time. "The first time I noticed it, it seemed to be going up rapidly and flashed for about two seconds. It was blinking on and off and seemed to be changing to red."
"I watched it for about 15 seconds," Mr. Reid went on. "When I got to the stop light, the thing I looked at again, but it was gone."
