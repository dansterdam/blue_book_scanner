The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically Photo Analysis Report No. 67-22 dated 27 April 1967.

The text in the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 67-22, DATED 27 April 1967

(1) Frame 14 contained four images and a void between the first and second images of an incident site to accommodate a possible aircraft. Distances between images gradually decreased in size as though in a turn.

The examining specialist was contacted and after examination of the camera calibrations, examination of the films advised that the images were probably would-be aircraft, with little or no structure discernible - probably due to progressive camera malfunction or angle of photography.

c. Although no explanation of the images has been arrived at, the possibility that this is an incident site involving anti-collision or other aircraft light exists. Detailed information as to location, direction etc. is not available. Confident data would be required to rule this out with absolute certainty.
