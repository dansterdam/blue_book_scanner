The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a form or questionnaire used for reporting UFO sightings as part of Project Blue Book, a historical program run by the United States Air Force to investigate unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

10. IF THE SIGHTING WAS ARRANGED, DID THIS ARRANGEMENT CHANGE DURING THE SIGHTING?

(INDICATE)

13. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DUSK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT MOVED, AND ITS GENERAL SHAPE AND COLOR: (SKETCHES, IF CLEAR, WILL BE HELPFUL IN LATER STUDIES - USE BACK OF THIS SHEET OR ATTACH ADDITIONAL SHEETS AS NECESSARY.)

The handwritten text in the document appears to provide a description of the UFO sighting, including details about the sky conditions, moon phase, and a brief description of the observed phenomenon.
