Transcribed text from the document:

Dear Sirs,
Your letter came to my attention a few days ago. I have been meaning to write you ever since but for some reason or other it has been pushed aside with many other things that need attention.

My wife and I saw an object that I believe to be the same as the one described in your letter around 11:15 pm on January 4, 1958. We were in our backyard in a small town near Houston, Texas and observed the object for about 10 to 15 minutes. It was a round, glowing object that seemed to hover in the sky, occasionally darting from side to side. It was completely silent and did not seem to have any exhaust or other visible means of propulsion. 

The object eventually disappeared behind some trees and we did not see it again. We are both mature, rational people and have never believed in "flying saucers" before. However, this experience has certainly made us more open-minded about the possibility of unidentified aerial phenomena. 

I hope this information is helpful to your study. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
