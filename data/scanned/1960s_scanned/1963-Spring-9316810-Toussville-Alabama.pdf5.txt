P. saw:
Love and understanding is something that can be shared by everyone. It in our worlds a thing to strive for, but, yet, again so all mankind.
Sincerely -- (Jim)

P.S. I don't know how I added so much more, but I thought to tell you that I have been a poor man my whole life to Mr. Kennedy's - but I have not taken his place in Kennedy's family and specifically being one of the lucky ones. I should think that have been born again until are still seem and much to the affairs of this world. (Please excuse)
P.--- How about a small snapshot?
You request a photograph. I will see what I can find. If I have any I will be glad to send you a different one. The truth is I don't recall taking any pictures or have any to send you.
This appears to be from Shelby County, Alabama. What is the direction of interest? I have not figured it out. Perhaps you can tell me more.
I appreciate so much what we saw. I have not photographed it, but I will try to obtain some pictures of more plain picture, so that I can send them to you. As you requested, I am enclosing a copy of more plain pictures or photographs.
The Captain whom I volunteered from the 4th U.S. Army to deliver this case. I would like very much to talk with you, so I can go over the details in full. Perhaps I should try to arrange for an interview (official Investigator) group. I would appreciate it very much.
I want no recognition. I was in no position to request it. I was simply trying to be of assistance, but still you should know the whole matter.
Please return pictures. Then I'll send you all I can find and the others in detail.
