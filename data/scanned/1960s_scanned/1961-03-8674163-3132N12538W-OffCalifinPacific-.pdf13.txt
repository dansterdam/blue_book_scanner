6 MAY 1964

HELEN,

This letter has to do with what paragraph 9, Apr 2001 has to do with. It is not asking about the identity of an UFO. He is not asking about the identity of an UFO. He is asking about identifications used in the Command Post. He is not asking about the identity of an UFO, although this is just a guess.

By the way, our file on this gentleman contains seven pieces of correspondence. This is the first time he has used this type of letter-head. This is other letters he has written to us in the past. In 1955 he was published in 1968. Please return it when you are finished so we can keep it on file.

I would not answer this letter from the UFO stand point, because it might precipitate a flow of letters from this man requesting information, which may not be justified, because it might be mistaken for an invitation.

I Atch
