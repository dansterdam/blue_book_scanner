It would be the advice and opinion of your consultant that the Air Force in discussing this case should hold fast to the advisability of not considering seriously any sighting or report from a single individual, and to attest that this case was investigated solely because of its possible nuisance value and because there will undoubtedly be an attempt made to jokey this incident into a full-fledged production.

The wider publicity attends to have public audiences in which will describe this thing and answer questions and this, of course, means undoubtedly there will be public lectures with paid admission. There seem to be now invitation lists from local newspapers, and the like.
