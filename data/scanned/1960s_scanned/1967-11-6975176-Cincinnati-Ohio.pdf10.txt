To whom it may concern,

On the night of Nov. 7, 1957, we were returning from a store to our home. As we were crossing Wooster Pike we observed a very bright, glowing object in the sky, about 10 to 12 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be about the size of a basketball.

It was hovering and seemed stationary. After observing it from the car for about 30 seconds, I left the car to get a better view. As I approached it, the object began to move. It proceeded to go in an easterly direction and appeared to go behind some trees. I ran after it but could not keep it in sight. It was a little over 3 minutes before I lost sight of it. I then returned to the car and we proceeded to our home, a distance of about 5 minutes drive. It was a little over 7:30 p.m. when we observed this object.

It was a clear night, no clouds, and the object was well defined. It seemed to give off a pulsating light, increasing in intensity and then diminishing, not a steady, constant light. My wife and I both observed this object and we are both certain that it was not any known type of aircraft. We thought at first it might be a satellite, but the movement and the fluctuating light pattern eliminated that possibility.

We are sincere in our report and believe that this sighting may be of interest to your investigation. We would be glad to answer any further questions you may have.
