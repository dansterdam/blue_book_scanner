The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, with a list of questions and space for handwritten answers.

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
LEAVE A TRAIL?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?

The text field at the bottom asks "HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR? MOVED OFF - VERY SLOWLY".
