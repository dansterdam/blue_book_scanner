This image does not contain any photographs, only text in the form of a questionnaire or report.

As per the OCR instructions, I will now reproduce the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  8  -  7  -  63

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

On the night of the sighting about 11:30 PM, I and my wife were awakened by a bright light coming through the bedroom window. Upon looking out, we could see a bright object in the sky which appeared to be oblong in shape and about the size of an automobile. It was hovering at about a 45 degree angle and was emitting a very bright light which illuminated the ground and the surrounding trees. The object moved slowly at first, then rapidly accelerated and disappeared. It was visible for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The duration of the sighting and the rapid acceleration I believe to be points of particular interest.
