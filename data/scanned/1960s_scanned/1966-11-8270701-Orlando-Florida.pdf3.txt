Special report of sighting: Vision of the Air Force system
November

To whom it may concern:

The below is a statement: I will swear to as a UFO observer. On November 2, 1966, at 7:32 PM EST, I was prompted to make my report on an aerial vision. 

It was Friday, November 4, 1966, at 7:32 PM EST, 2 orange glowing objects traveling north about 5000 feet in altitude of planes circling for landing at an nearby airport. The objects appeared to be moving rather slowly and alternating patterns. It was moving rather slowly and hovering in a stationary position. I remarked on the grasping of the good year blimp and imagined it was about the same size. when we slowed down to a stop, the objects then started to accelerate at a high rate of speed and in a short time went out of sight. They appeared to be under intelligent control. I suggest that we have far more to learn about this type of visual contact around 3:15 AM, I suggested to a crew on colonial Drive. We were driving west on Colonial Drive. We were stopped at a traffic light, and it appeared to be stationary, then moved off, then it appeared to be stationary again. I suggest further study of this type of incident.
