SKY SIGHTINGS IN FOCUS

The sky over the Triple Cities, to many persons a novelty, has become a commonplace of phenomena to the trained observers with binoculars. These persons, who have been known as a team of "sky watchers", have reported on their observations.

They were found to encounter objects of all types, some close and some distant, of many colors and shapes. Many of these were lights, some constant and some flashing, and some in groups of two or three.

Dr. Allen Hynek, chairman of the Astronomy Department at the Ohio State University and scientific consultant for the Air Force on "unidentified flying objects", has been quoted as saying that "their reports are of great value in assembling the total picture".

THEIR STATION WAS THREE HOURS STINT WITH SEVEN-TWENTY-EIGHT BINOCULARS: the astronomical observers reported nine airplanes including one large jet bomber with red and green lights, approaching to southwest to northeast. Also a fast jet, flying very high from west to east, and some other lights.

9:27 p.m. - Large jet bomber with red and green lights, approaching to southwest to northeast.
9:35 p.m. - Two jets flying very high from west to east.
9:43 p.m. - A bright red meteor, streaking through the sky in a southwesterly direction.
10:10 p.m. - An airplane circling near the northeastern horizon.
10:20 p.m. - A meteor, northwest to east.
10:27 p.m. - Two jets, southwest to northeast.
10:37 p.m. - A bright, pulsating, southeast to northwest.
10:40 p.m. - A very bright meteor, northeast to northwest.
10:45 p.m. - Echo I communications satellite, east to west, bright and high overhead.
10:51 p.m. - Another bright object, southwest to southeast.

TONIGHT, MR. BUDINE SAID, Echo I should be visible as a bright object from west to east from 9:35 to 10:55 and from 11:37 to 11:57.
