The image appears to contain a photograph of a UFO sighting. The caption below the image states "In this closure, taken a few seconds later, the image is somewhat smaller, apparently due to rated distortion."

WHAT IT PORTENDS
An analysis of the evidence so far presented indicates that the object photographed must have had substantial reality, in the sense of being something physical or material, as distinct from a mere atmospheric phenomenon, and that it was something that entered the airspace over Long Island from over the water and was observed in daylight by multiple witnesses for a period of up to 15 minutes. This seems unquestionably to be what we call a "flying saucer" or unidentified flying object (UFO).
While the object photographed bears a striking resemblance to the typical "flying saucer" descriptions, neither the apparent size, relative speed, nor altitude can be determined from the evidence so far. It was almost certainly close to the ground to allow satisfactory visual observation, but may have been considerably higher than the 200 feet indicated in some accounts. Nor can it be determined conclusively whether the object was truly disc-shaped or merely appeared so from the viewing angle. An ellipsoid or other shape is possible.
But the testimony of the multiple observers, and the photographic evidence, considered together, seem clearly to indicate that some kind of strange, unknown and unexpected vehicle or device was present and observable over a substantial period of time on Long Island on September 3, 1966. This seems to be, in fact, a genuine UFO sighting.
