The image contains two illustrations. The top one is a compass rose with various cardinal directions labeled. The bottom one is a sketch of a landscape with a silhouetted figure in the foreground.

Now, I will extract all the text from the document:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A H ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT AS IT MOVED FROM LOCATION.

POSITION SYMBOL BELOW PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. IF THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO MOVE FROM THIS POSITION, DRAW AN ARROW TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT. IF THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE.
