Dear Miss [redacted],

Your letter reporting the sighting of an unidentified flying object did not contain sufficient information for a valid conclusion.

Enclosed is an Air Force questionnaire which we ask you to complete and return. This will provide us with more details to assist the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center in their evaluation.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. PACKER
Lt. Colonel, USAF
