Clearwater, Florida
July 8, 1964

Mr. Hubert was in his garage working on his car at approximately 9:00 p.m. when he looked up and noticed a large, brightly lighted object in the sky. He called his wife to come and look at it. The object was oval-shaped, very bright white in color, and appeared to be about 1,000 yards away. It hovered silently for about 15 minutes, then suddenly shot straight up out of sight. 

Mr. Hubert stated the object was approximately 50 feet in diameter and seemed to be about 500 feet in the air when he first saw it. He said the object did not make any sound and there was no exhaust or vapor trail. 

The witness was very impressed by the size and brightness of the object and his wife corroborated his story. They were both convinced they had seen some type of unidentified flying object.
