1. This subject photograph has been examined but no conclusions could be reached as to the identity or nature of the object. However, it appears to be a small object, possibly a light or reflector, rather than an astronomical or celestial phenomena.

2. On one of the photographs the light source was almost in the exact center of the film frame, suggesting a direct overhead position relative to the object. The other photograph shows the light source in the upper right portion of the film frame, indicating some angle or lateral position compared to the object.

3. No further examination or analysis appears to be a productive effort. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that the object photographed is unidentified.
