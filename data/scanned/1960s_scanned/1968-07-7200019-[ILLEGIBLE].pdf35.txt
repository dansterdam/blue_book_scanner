TO OFFICIALS
The Military and many civilians were surprised, alarmed, and somewhat mystified by certain unidentified aerial phenomena witnessed Sunday night, July 7, 1968. Aviation officials at Ground Control in Gander, Newfoundland, received numerous reports of strange lights and objects in the sky from pilots, tower personnel, and others. Sergeant Edward A. Rowe, Control Tower Operator in Gander, informed the headquarters of the North American Air Defense Command at Colorado Springs, CO, of these observations.
PILOT RUDY MALASSINNA described formation of lights which he observed sometime around 11:30 p.m. local time. According to his report, he was flying a Trans-Canada Airlines flight from Toronto to Deer Lake, Newfoundland, when he noticed a formation of lights below him which seemed to be hovering about 500 feet above the ground. He called the attention of the co-pilot and engineer to the strange phenomena. The lights were described as white, red, green and blue, arranged in a triangular formation, with the blue light at the apex. The formation was observed for about 15 minutes. As he approached nearer, the lights either disappeared or scattered in various directions.
THIS BALLOON theory is inadequate to explain the foregoing description of the phenomena by a competent airline pilot. Balloons couldn't fly in formation or change directions as described. The objects were under intelligent control.
