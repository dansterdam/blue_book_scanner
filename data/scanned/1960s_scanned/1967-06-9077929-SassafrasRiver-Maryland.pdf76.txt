Call three of us went out on the woods on our camp in Sassafras River, Maryland about 2 mile from here at about 9:00 PM. The object came from the south east very fast and climbed straight up and was out of sight in a few seconds. It was round and very bright and made no sound. All we three saw it and it always is very strange and hard to explain that sight.
