Dear Sir:

On Monday, September 19, 1966 at approximately 9:30 p.m., a group of football players were returning from driving the football players home from a game. The players saw an object through and above the tree tops. As the object came closer, the object disappeared from sight.

There was no moon reflection, but it had a reddish orange glow and was shaped like a cigar. It appeared to be about 75 feet in length.

The object appeared approximately 5 miles South of Haynesville, Louisiana, East off Highway 79. 

We think this is worthy of investigation.

Sincerely yours,
