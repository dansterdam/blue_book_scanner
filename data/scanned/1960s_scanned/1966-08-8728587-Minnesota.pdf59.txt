UFO SIGHTING, 16 AUGUST 1966

The information submitted has been studied and we feel that it observed a certain cloud which was visible to the northern part of the United States on the night of 16 August 1966. His description, regarding shape, size, color, and motion is consistent with that reported by various other witnesses in the states of North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Air Force investigation revealed that various NASA scientists were participating in several upper atmosphere experiments in the Fort Churchill, Canada area. At 2339 GMT on 15 August 1966 a rocket, equipped with an experimental package, was launched from Fort Churchill and reached an altitude of approximately 230 miles. Shortly before reaching the programmed altitude, a barium cloud was released into the atmosphere. The attached news release provides additional information regarding the objective of this scientific experiment. The Fort Churchill experiment proceeded the Wallops Island experiment; however, they were identical in experimental objectives.
