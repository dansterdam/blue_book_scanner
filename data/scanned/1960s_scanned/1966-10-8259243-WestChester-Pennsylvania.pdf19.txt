CASE SIGHTING REPORT
8 OCTOBER 1966
WEST CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA
BACKGROUND:  On 8 October 1966, at approximately 2000 hours, Mr. Howard S. Hill, 1342 Oakbourne Road, West Chester, Pennsylvania, reported to the Pennsylvania Air National Guard that he had observed a strange object in the sky earlier that evening.
DETAILS OF SIGHTING:  Mr. Hill stated that at approximately 1945 hours, while driving home from work, he observed a bright, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky near West Chester.  He stated that the object was approximately 60-75 feet in diameter and was white in color.  Mr. Hill further reported that the object hovered in the same general area for approximately 10-15 minutes before rapidly accelerating and disappearing from sight.
INVESTIGATION:  The report of this sighting was forwarded to Air Force Project "Blue Book" for investigation.  Interview of Mr. Hill revealed that he was a reliable witness with no known history of reporting unusual aerial phenomena.  The weather at the time of the sighting was clear with unlimited visibility.  No other witnesses to the sighting were located.
CONCLUSION:  Based on the investigation, this incident was classified as "Unidentified."  The rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object, coupled with its unusual shape and characteristics, precluded identification as a conventional aircraft or other known object.
