Transcribed text from the document:

PLEASE IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN. PLEASE ALSO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE OBJECT MOVED.

PLEASE DRAW A SKETCH OF THE PHENOMENON WHICH FIRST SEEN, AND A SKETCH OF IT AS IT APPEARED TO MOVE AWAY. THE SKETCHES SHOULD BE APPROXIMATELY TO SCALE. PROVIDE ANY OTHER PERTINENT DETAILS WHICH YOU CAN RECALL TO ACCOMPANY THE SKETCHES.
