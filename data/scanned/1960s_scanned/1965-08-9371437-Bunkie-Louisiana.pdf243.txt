UFO Reports Discounted
At Field
A group of Unidentified Fly- ing Objects (UFOs) reports near
an Air Force base has been dis counted as phony.
The reports came from Oklahoma and Wyoming. Oklaho mans got the notion the objects sighted were actually weather balloons, Dayton reports said.
The sightings, described as bright, glowing objects in the sky, were reported by residents around the Clinton-Sherman Air Force base near Burns Flat, Okla.
The spokesman here said what appeared to become "UFOs" were actually weather balloons from the base. "These regularly scheduled balloon flights are sent up from the Air Force base periodically," he said.
The reports were first picked up and printed by a Wichita, Kan.- paper, claiming the sightings were made from the area of Hutchinson, Kan., which is about 45 miles as the crow flies from the Clinton-Sherman base.
However, the Oklahoma State Patrol said the reported sightings were actually near the Clinton-Sherman base and not around Hutchinson.
These sightings followed a rash of such reports in Texas and California during the past week. A Welling- ton, Kan., policeman looked up and sighted what he described as about three car lengths long, egg-shaped and moved in an erratic manner along a straight path.
