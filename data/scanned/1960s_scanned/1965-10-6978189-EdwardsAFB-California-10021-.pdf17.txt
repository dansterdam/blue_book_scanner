The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page is mostly blank, with a rectangular bordered area taking up the majority of the space, but no visible photograph or image.
