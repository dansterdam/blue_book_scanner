No Case (Information Only) 25 July 1963 Blackpool, England

Seven UFOs sighted - 9.30 p.m. to 10.00 p.m. 

Mr. L. R. Booth of Northumberland Avenue, Blackpool, wrote to the Deputy Director of Operations with details of seven UFOs observed by himself and his family on 8 and 9 August 1963. The report states:

"On August 8 and 9 I have been observing in the sky with my family seven lights, red, yellow, green in color. They have also been seen by others in the Blackpool area. On the evening of August 8 at about 12.30 a.m. I happened to look up and saw these seven lights. They were in a circular formation, very bright, almost like astralight, and moving very fast and silently."

The observer goes on to describe the movements and behavior of the UFOs, noting that they were "splitting a fast pace" and "moving very fast".
