14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? OVER HORIZON

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound NONE
b. Color APPEARED AS A STAR

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how many times the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
ABOUT 6 FULL APPARENT DIAMETERS OF THE SAME KNOWN OBSERVED STAR

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
