TDET (UFO)
UFO OBSERVATION OF FEBRUARY 1968

Hamburg, New York 14075

Reference your letter of 13 October 1969. Enclosed is the negative to your UFO sighting of 7 February 1968. Photographic analysis of your negative revealed the following:

"Examination of the referenced photography revealed that the 'unidentified flying object' is probably a result of a multiple exposure or a flashing light source. The erratic pattern displayed is probably caused by camera motion/vibration."
