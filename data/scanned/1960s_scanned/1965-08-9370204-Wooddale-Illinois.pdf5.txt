SUBJECT: No intercept was attempted. I checked with the PIA Tower Watch Supervisor, and they stated that they had not had any sightings that were considered unusual, meteorological, or otherwise, which might account for the sighting. All their radar scopes were clear at the time. The visual observer stated that the object observed was quite large, shaped like a bell or dome, grey in color, and appeared to be moving eastward at a high rate of speed. This object was observed for approximately 3-5 minutes before disappearing from view. All personnel on duty at the time are considered reliable and trustworthy observers. I am submitting this report in accordance with established directives.
