Transcribing the text from the document:

STILL CURIOUS ENOUGH.... this is the object described by the witnesses. It was seen briefly and then disappeared quickly. It has the appearance of a silver-gray or tan color, and the shape was round.

BODY seemed a dull colour, differed from the bright centres, and seemed to revolve or turn slowly. The outer portion was more hazy or diffused. The object was seen by five or six people and appeared to be some distance from the ground.
