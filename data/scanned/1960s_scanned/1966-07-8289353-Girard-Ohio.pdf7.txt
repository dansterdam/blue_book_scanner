Dear Major Quintanilla:

I have given this a great deal of thought before deciding to write you. I feel that it is important that I complete a report, if possible, on a sighting that occurred on the night of July 7, 1966. This sighting was observed and confirmed by two witnesses and I believe it to be quite significant. 

The primary witness was a lady who was an employee of the local U.F.O. organization. She reported sighting a U.F.O. at approximately 9:00 p.m. The object was described as an intense white light which hovered, maneuvered at high speed, and made abrupt turns. At one point the object disappeared and then reappeared. The second witness, a Mr. Dale Girard, also reported observing the same object at the same time.

I realize that this type of report may be of little interest, but I felt it important to submit it for your records. I would be most interested in any comments or advice you may have regarding this incident.

Sincerely,
