12. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROJECTIONS. AND INDICATE ROUGHLY THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.
Sphere
Axes
No noticeable protrusions or vapor trails 
WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT, BUILDING, TREE ETC.? THIS WILL INDICATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE SKY, OR NEAR OBJECT, THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE OCCUPIED.
I am not able to guess that exactly, but I would guess that about 1/3 of the sky height the object would have been covered by the watch head.
