Gentlemen:

On the night of february 23, at 1920 hrs., a disc-like object was sighted and observed for 5 minutes. The object was oval or elliptical in shape, approximately 30' in diameter and observed at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft. It was silent and moved across the sky at a high speed, between 350-400 mph. The object was observed by two independent witnesses simultaneously.

At about 1940 hrs., the same object reappeared and was observed for an additional 5 minutes. The object was again observed at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft. and moved at a high speed, estimated to be between 350-400 mph.

I feel compelled to report this incident as I feel it has significant bearing on the community of intelligence relative to the subject. If you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,"
