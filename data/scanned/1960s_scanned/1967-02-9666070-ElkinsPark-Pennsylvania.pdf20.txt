Transcription of the text in the image:

Dear Major Quintanilla,

I am forwarding to you the results of my investigative efforts concerning a U.F.O. sighting and photograph which was forwarded to me by Major David R. Shea (acting Chief, Information Division, Office of Information, Washington, D.C.). The results are as follows:

1. The photograph in question was not forwarded with the investigative report. It would be most helpful if the photograph could be made available for analysis.

2. Point to point measurements of the object seem to indicate that it was quite large, as the claim being made is that the object was approximately 200 feet in diameter. This measurement, if accurate, would seem to make it unlikely to be a hoax or a miniature model.

3. If you were to examine such a photograph, I would suggest looking for evidence which would either support or negate the claim that this is sufficient evidence of a multiple UFO manifesting itself.

At this time, I do not feel that the evidence is sufficient to conclude that this is a multiple UFO manifesting itself. I await your comments and the photograph, if available.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
