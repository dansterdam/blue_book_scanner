There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from what seems to be an old UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

Transcription of the text:

Clarification: There were a bright, greenish streak of light observed in the sky, and a fairly good-sized, round light object (which appeared to have a dark center) moved on a constant course with the bright streak, as if the two objects were connected.

This sighting occurred at about 8:50 PM for over 2 minutes. The bright streak of light was traveling in a diagonal course from the northeast to the southwest, and the object was following it closely. At one point, the object caught up with the streak and appeared to join or merge with it.

Both the streak and the object moved in a straight, uniform motion across the sky. The object was easily visible and was quite large (estimated to be about 1/3 the apparent size of the moon). 

I thank you sincerely,
