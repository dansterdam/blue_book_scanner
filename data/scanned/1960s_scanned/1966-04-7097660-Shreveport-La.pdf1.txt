COMMENTS INVESTIGATING OFFICER'S: There was at this time at Shreveport, a carnival with several large rides and most of them are so lighted with brightly colored lights of various descriptions. There were, in fact, several small clouds at a low altitude in the area, and investigating officers strongly feel that what the eyes noted was one or more of these lights reflecting on the clouds as they passed over. The movement of the cloud could give the light the appearance of movement as it would.
