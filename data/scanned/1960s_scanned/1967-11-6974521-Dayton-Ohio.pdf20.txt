When it was seen first it appeared oval shaped and white, bright light coming from the underneath. As it came closer, it appeared more like a saucer shape, with a dark center and the bright light around the edge of the underside. It was moving silently across the sky at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 mph, straight and level. It was observed for approximately 30 seconds. The night was clear with stars visible.
