Over a period of approximately 3-5 minutes, an object was observed approximately 15 to 15 nautical miles, over Quantico, Virginia, approx 30 to 50 thousand feet in altitude, and traveling at a speed of approximately 7,000 to 17,000 feet per second, according to the tracking radar. This object was observed by two observers through binoculars. According: Washington, D.C.
