Date of Sighting: 9 June 1967 
Time of Sighting: 2155-2200 hours
Location: Landers, California 
Reporting Witness: Ralph Landers 
Sighting Description: Witness observed a large, brightly lighted object in the sky. The object appeared to be in the vicinity of the Landers Observatory operated by Riverside Astronomical Society.
Sighting Details: Witness reported that the object was first observed at 2155 hours Pacific Daylight Saving Time. The object was described as very large, brightly lighted, and was maneuvering in the vicinity of the Landers Observatory operated by the Riverside Astronomical Society. The object was seen for about 5 minutes before disappearing from view. The observer stated that when the object first appeared it was high in the sky to the southeast, but gradually descended until it appeared to be near the observatory building. The witness indicated that the observatory dome was illuminated and that the object seemed to be observing the dome. No other details of the sighting were provided.
Conclusion: Investigation revealed that the lighted object reported by the witness was likely a high altitude research balloon. The Landers Observatory was undergoing construction and repairs at the time of the sighting, and the illumination of the dome may have contributed to the witness's perception of the object's proximity to the observatory. No explanation could be determined for the object's apparent maneuvering, but the sighting was determined to be of insufficient detail to categorize as an unidentified flying object.
