Sept 30, 1962

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object, Priest Lake, Idaho

On Sept 6, 1962, a resident of Priest Lake, Idaho reported sighting a strange object in the sky on Sept 1, 1962.

The report states that while observing some fragments of a suspected meteor shower, the witness suddenly noticed a strange bright light in the sky that seemed to be approaching his location. As the object came closer, it appeared to be a large, partially illuminated, disc-shaped craft. The witness stated that the craft hovered motionless for a time, then suddenly accelerated and departed at a high rate of speed, disappearing from view.

The witness claims that he was able to observe the object for several minutes and that it appeared to be approximately 75-100 feet in diameter. He states that it was partially illuminated, with a bright light at the center and darker edges. The witness claims that he felt a strange sensation during the observation and that all electrical equipment in his home malfunctioned briefly during the event.

The Air Force conducted an investigation of this report but was unable to definitively identify the object. The investigator noted that the witness appeared to be a credible observer with no known history of mental illness or tendency toward fabrication. The investigator also noted that the reported effects on the electrical equipment in the home lent some credibility to the witness's account.

In conclusion, this incident remains classified as an "unidentified" sighting in the Project Blue Book files, as the Air Force was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the witness's observations.
