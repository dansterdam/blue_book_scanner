The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the top is a compass-like diagram with directional labels. The smaller sketches below show a person standing on a road in a landscape with hills or mountains in the background.

The text output is as follows:

EA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSEâ€”PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A DASH ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.  

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. AND A DASH AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND THE DASH WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE PATH OF MOVEMENT. INDICATE WITH A DASH AS TO WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALL SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
