TO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
24 July 1963

Two boys saw sneer:

The two boys, whose identities were concealed, said they saw a strange object maneuvering in the sky on Saturday evening, 22 June 1963, in the Scarsdale area of New York. They reported the object as oval in shape, dark in color, and about 40 feet in diameter. It appeared to be traveling at a moderate speed and maintaining a relatively level altitude. During the sighting, the object seemed to be rotating or spinning. When the object was first sighted, it was at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 feet. Later, it descended to about 2,500 feet, still maintaining its oval shape and dark color.

The two boys, who were not identified in the report, claimed the object was in sight for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before it disappeared from view. They became frightened and ran to a nearby house to report what they had seen. The police were notified, but by the time they arrived at the scene, the object had vanished. No other witnesses to the incident were found.

An investigation was conducted, but the Air Force was unable to identify the object. The case was classified as "unidentified."
