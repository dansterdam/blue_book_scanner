There are two illustrations in this image. The first is a compass rose diagram that instructs the viewer to "NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. PLACE A '+' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO FIRST SEEN." 

The second illustration shows two sketches. The larger one depicts a person standing in a landscape with various objects and shapes in the sky. The smaller one shows a person standing in a landscape with a curved horizon line.
