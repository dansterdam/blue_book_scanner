MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY DIVISION, SAFB
ATTENTION: Mr. Wilson, Team A
SUBJECT: Draft of Reply to Congressman Lipscomb
This following is a recommended reply to Congressman Leonard P. Lipscomb's letter of 11 February:
Dear Congressman Lipscomb:
Thank you for your letter of 14 February in which you request a basis for reply to Mrs. ______ letter regarding unidentified flying objects.
Forwarded with Mrs. ______ letter was a report of an unidentified flying object supposedly observed from Hollywood, California on 5 and 6 February 1950.
A preliminary check of Air Force files has not brought to light any reports of UFOs sighted in the area on either 5 or 6 February 1950.
We would, however, like to check this further. We would also like to carefully review the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena report which was forwarded to you by Mrs. Bratten.
Please consider this an interim reply. Additional information and the report will be forwarding as an early date.
