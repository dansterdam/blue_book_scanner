The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass rose diagram showing the directions (N, E, S, W) and is labeled "HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN 'A' AT THE POSITION TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A 'B' AT THE POSITION TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN."

The second set of sketches appears to depict a landscape, with a figure standing in the foreground and some hills or mountains in the background. There is a caption that says "IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'A' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A 'B' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE 'A' AND 'B' WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. (IF STATIONARY, SIMPLY PLACE AN 'A' ONLY.)"

As for the text in the document, here is the output:
