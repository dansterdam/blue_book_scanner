The image contains a compass diagram on the right side, but does not appear to have any photographs.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that a bright light was reported at the point where the dotted line crosses the horizon (as described). Place a "B" on the diagram at that point and a "T" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place a "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
