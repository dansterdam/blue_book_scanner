10. CONCLUSION
This object could not be identified. It was observed in one spot and
moved rapidly out of sight. No sound nor exhaust was observed.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The object was observed for less than a minute. It was sighted at first
in one spot and then moved rapidly out of sight. No sound nor trail
was noted. Its abrupt maneuver and rapid disappearance made it
impossible to adequately observe it. Its metallic reflection and
soundless movement indicate it was probably a solid object, but its
nature could not be determined.
