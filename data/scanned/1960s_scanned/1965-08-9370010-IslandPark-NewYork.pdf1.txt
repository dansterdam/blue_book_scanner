11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer noted lights that appeared for almost 2 hours above a neighbor's house. Lights were like a bright moon appearing one at a time. 4 lights were observed during the 2 hour period.
Photo analysis identified the UFOs as point sources of light. Camera movement probably caused each point of light to appear as a larger irregular image.
