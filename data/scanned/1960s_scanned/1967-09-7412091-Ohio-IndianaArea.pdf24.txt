ATTN OF: TDPT/UFO                                  JAN 3 1968

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 14 September 1967  

TO: Indianapolis Municipal Airport
Indianapolis, Indiana 46206

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of unidentified flying object reports from the Indianapolis area occurred on 14 September 1967 between 3:40 am and 4:15 am.

2. The report describes two different sightings, at approximately 3:40 am a bright white object, that was trailing sparks and flames, was observed moving in a northeast direction. At 3:55 am, two different objects were observed in the northeast. This object was also trailing flames, but the flames were observed for approximately two minutes each and were witnessed by several aircraft crew members near Indianapolis.

3. These observations appear similar to that of a satellite decay and would like to plot its trajectory. Request information as whether your agency received any similar reports on this night at the above approximate times.

4. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.
