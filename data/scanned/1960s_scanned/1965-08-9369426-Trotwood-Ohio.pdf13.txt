The following account comes from a letter to the Flying Saucer Review, dated September 6, we read of the unusual experience of a Mrs. Mears, who was on holiday in Scotland with her husband on 2 August 1965. The letter states:
"On this date, while driving along the A84 road between Stirling and Callander, my husband and I could hardly believe our eyes - at a point in the road not far from Stirling, we saw a small metallic-looking object hovering a few feet above the ground. It was shaped rather like a plate, and gleamed in the sunlight. We stopped the car and watched it for about 10 minutes or more. It appeared to rotate slowly, and all of a sudden it shot upwards at an unbelievable speed and disappeared from sight. My husband and I could hardly believe what we had seen, it was such an unusual occurrence."
