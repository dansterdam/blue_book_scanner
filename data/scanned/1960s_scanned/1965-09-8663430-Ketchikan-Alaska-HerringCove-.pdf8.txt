1. Reference the attached unidentified object report from our area. The sighting of objects on the nights of 26 July and 4 September 1965 were reported and investigated.

2. We had no unusual reports from Pike County, Missouri during this period. The UFO reported could not be shown by air surveillance and/or ground observers. We feel that the normal time lapse and delay of the submission of her report no attempt will be made to identify a specific flight.
