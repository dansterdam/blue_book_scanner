When you stayed up to watch meteors, was this in hopes of sighting a spaceship?

Just to watch meteors. My friend is--what do you call it--not a meteor watcher, but an astronomer. He has one of those little telescopes. He says we were going to have a meteor shower coming up in a few days. I think he called it the Lyrids, or the Perseids, or something like that. But that one that was sighted over here, they say it went way off.

Craig
Did you see that one?

No. We didn't know anything about it until this morning.

Knowing that you were going to developed pictures with this little Brownie camera, tell me about how you operated it and the timing of it.

Do you count 15 seconds off the last you can't. go into 15 thousand and two, one thousand and two.

Then you snapped one picture, and 15 seconds during development, and it looked pretty good. And waited another 15 seconds, and looked at it. It didn't look pretty good to me, because I just glanced at it and saw it was blurred or something. But this friend of mine, he claims he can tell, before my eyes heard him calling, because I was so damned interested in watching that light go down the road, I never noticed him behind me. I heard my friend coming down the road, I turned around and he says "Do you want to see your friend, And then I went to show it to him, and saw the place I had tried to get on the view of the object.

But I mean to tell you they did cut out the view of the object. I did go to look up there, and he didn't use it. 

No, I looked up there with him, and neither one of us saw it. A balloon wouldn't have been able to get out of the way that fast.
