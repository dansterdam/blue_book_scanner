TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

RV-15.1.3-OFOWR-66-24981
Reporting Witness: James P. James 
Location: Hedgeville,West Virginia
Date: July 8, 1966
Time: 3:00 AM

My wife and I were awakened by a bright, pulsating light in the sky around 3:00 AM. We observed two disc-shaped objects maneuvering over the area for about 20 minutes before they disappeared. The objects were silent and moved in a zig-zag pattern at high speeds before simply vanishing. I reported this incident to the local authorities, who advised me to contact the Air Force. No other witnesses have come forward.
