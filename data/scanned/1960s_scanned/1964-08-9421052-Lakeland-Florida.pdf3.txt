Dear Sir,

I have 30 years off experience in the field of electrical engineering. I was working on a project which involved the construction of a device that was capable of affecting the functioning of electrical systems over a considerable distance, as an experiment rather than with any specific purpose in mind. On the evening of August 8, 1964, I was working on this device in my laboratory in Lakeland, Florida, when I observed some strange lights in the sky.

I do not know exactly what I saw, but the phenomenon was quite remarkable. The lights appeared to move in an erratic manner and to change direction abruptly. At one point, they seemed to pause in mid-air before accelerating rapidly. I would be most interested to know if anyone else in the area observed this event and if the Air Force or other agencies have any information regarding it.

I am enclosing a sketch of what I observed, although I realize that it may not be entirely accurate. I would be grateful if you could let me know if this incident was reported to your organization and if there is any further information available.

Yours sincerely,
