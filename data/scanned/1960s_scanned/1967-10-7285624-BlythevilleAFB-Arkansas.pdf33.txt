A DESCRIBE WHAT YOU SAW AND THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS, INCLUDING TIME OF SIGHTING, DURATION, DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT, SIZE, SHAPE, SPEED, COLOR, SOUND, BEHAVIOR, AND OVERALL IMPRESSIONS? GIVE DETAILS THAT MIGHT INDICATE WHETHER IT WAS SOLID OR TRANSPARENT, WHETHER IT GLOWED OR REFLECTED, WHETHER IT WAS BLINKING OR STEADY, AND WHETHER IT MADE MANEUVERS OR REMAINED STATIONARY.
The objects were shiny and silver in color. They appeared to be about the size of a golf ball when held at arm's length. They moved slowly then seemed to make a sharp turn and went out of sight. It took about a minute from the time I first saw them until they disappeared. I could not determine if the objects were solid or transparent, but they seemed to be very bright and shiny. There was no sound associated with the sighting.

The objects were shaped like stars, but they were much larger and brighter than any stars I've ever seen. They seemed to move in a graceful, deliberate manner, and the change in direction was very noticeable. Somehow I got the impression that they were under intelligent control, but I can't say for certain. It was a strange experience and I'm still puzzled by what I saw.
