164
Secretary, Department
of National Defense,
Ottawa, Ont.
On August eighth, about 9:30
p.m. I observed an object in
the sky near my home.
Mr. Chisholm, Royal Canadian Air
Force, appeared to be in
agreement with my report. The
object was traveling for at least forty
minutes. I had checked the stars
for any comparison. It continued to
travel at the same speed until out of sight
(about right minutes). 
Since the main object was very
high and difficult to estimate its exact size,
I may have deemed it
should be reported accordingly.
W. Michaud, Hannan
