Officials at the airport control tower had only seen a "very pretty light about the size of a star" high in the sky. They said the object was stationary and that they had not called the military, since the object had caused no disturbance.

Calls to the star revealed it was the satellite Vanguard. Officials said that it was orbiting as forecasted.

While lines of cars lengthened to a halt on the main road, crowds of pedestrians staring upward screened to a halt and glanced out toward a luminous object.

"It seemed to be growing larger and larger," one witness said.

Another described the object as changing in size and shape—now appearing round, now oval, even triangular at times—and finally moving upward at a "terrific rate of speed" toward the west.

One driver said the object appeared to be just hovering and was brilliantly lit. "It seemed to be hovering and then going down toward the trees and back up again," he said.

Some reported seeing two or three objects, while others saw only one. Several described the objects as "disc-shaped" or "saucer-shaped," and several said the objects emitted a brilliant white light.

Police Lt. Klinck said that when the object was first sighted just before dawn, it appeared to be stationary, but then it began moving and seemed to go up and down and back and forth. He said the object was so bright that it was difficult to look at it.

Two witnesses said the object appeared to "go down behind a tree, then come up again."

The satellites, officials said, are orbiting as scheduled and expected. They said this explained the sightings, which were described as "typical satellite or meteor sightings."
