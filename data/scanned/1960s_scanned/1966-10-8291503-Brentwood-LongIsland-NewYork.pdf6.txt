Spectacle
Over LI
BY LEONARD VICTOR
Rewritten and photographed
from an undisclosed LOF o
observer's account.
And although I did not
really see the close detail I
should have liked to, I did
obtain three clear shots of
the UFO I was photographIng. They show some of
the mysterious aerial objects
that have been seen in the
area in the last few days.
At the same time I was
watching and photographing
the UFO, a friend who
drives a jeep stationed on a
hill overlooking the area was
also watching and photographing the same objects
and other sightings in the
eastern sky. But strange as
it may seem to some, he's
not going to believe it.
You see, what I observed and
photographed was so close
and so brilliant that the
"UFO's Are Coming" theories
are no longer theories.
They are face.
WHAT I first saw was a
brilliant white object, much
brighter than the surrounding stars and at least ten
times their size at the
same time.
It was brilliantly luminous, and at the same time
the whole shape was clear
in the color of an old silver
dollar.
