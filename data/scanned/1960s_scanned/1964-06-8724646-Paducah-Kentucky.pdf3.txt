Emission Spectrographic Analyses

The data for qualitative emission spectrographic analyses of various portions of the unidentified object and surrounding debris are given in Table I. The portions analyzed are identified as follows:

(1) Earth from jar
(2) Chloroform extract of earth from jar
(3) Sandy material from object
(4) Chain-link cloth from object
(5) Stratige fiber from object
(6) Green plastic from outside surface of object
(7) Green plastic material from inside surface of object
(8) Sample from black streak on sectioned surface

An indication of the relative amount of each element present in the samples is given by the symbols +, ++, or +++ for high, medium, or low traces, or none found, respectively. The results must be tempered from sample to sample because of differences in sample weights. The samples of earth and plastic were large, being of the order of 1 to 15 milliliters, whereas the other samples were small bulks of the order of fractions of a milligram. No unusual amounts nor contents of elements were found for the samples analyzed -- i.e., the findings were in accord with that of a sand-cemented plastic object and many earth extracted with oil. No indication of the cause of the green color in the plastic was found.
