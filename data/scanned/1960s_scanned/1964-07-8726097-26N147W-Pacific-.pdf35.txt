"Another Mystery Crater"
Something in early July "something" fell in the Glen Canyon area of Utah and another group of ranchers rode to the site of a 30-foot hole on a mountain 13 miles west of Glen Canyon. Ranchers reported that a rancher had discovered the hole, which was first reported by Tony J. Mascaro. An official investigation, after a trip into the mountains back of his ranch nine miles from Blanding, found no pictures of the hole and plans were made to send them to qualified geologists. The source of this information is unknown, and additional details were given. We are interested in further information about the description of the hole, findings of the specialists, etc.
