The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, providing a detailed description of a sighting that occurred.

2. The B-52 arrived in the area on a 50 nautical mile radius glacerence and began vertical maneuvers, including a vertical "S" pattern. This took place at almost the same time as the first ground sighting. It is entirely possible that the initial sighting and the subsequent activities of the object were in fact the B-52 accomplishing upper airwork. Later sightings of bright lights and flashing green and white lights, accompanied by a low jet engine sound, corresponded with the B-52 making a VOR penetration, low approach, and missed approach. Portions of the maneuver are accomplished with the aircraft landing lights on. These layered cloud conditions could have diffused light sources and made identification difficult (ref TWX from Lt Col Warlich).

3. At 0435 local, the pilot of the B-52 sighted a bright light in the west-northwest on or near the ground. At 0439 Vega was on the horizon at azimuth 345 degrees.

C. Plasma and effects: electrical equipment and can also be noticed on radar.
1. Plasma, such as ball lightning, can occur in clear weather as well as stormy weather.
2. Plasma, such as ball lightning, can be seen visually and appear as a fiery ball. The most common colors are red, orange, yellow, blue and white.
3. Aurora borealis is quite often seen from Minot AFB at this time of the year and is an electrical atmospheric phenomenon.
