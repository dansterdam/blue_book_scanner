The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report about a UFO sighting in Cordova, Argentina.

SUBJECT: UFO - CORDOVA, ARGENTINA
ANALYSIS: Capt Benson
DATE: 27 Dec 67

Photo analysis was requested for a print forwarded to PID via the Office of the Commanding General. The print displayed an object with a serrated outer edge. There are no other images or data pertaining to this document. The background is indistinct and appears to be mostly of a very dirty and heavily damaged negative and is an enlargement or unknown quality.

Considering these factors, it is felt that there is insufficient data available to allow for an attempt at any definitive analysis of the object.
