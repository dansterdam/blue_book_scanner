July 17, 1964
9:45 P.M.

Returning home at night of July 17, 1964, my husband and I were called outside to see a strange light in the sky. We rushed outside and saw that it was not a plane or star, but a strange, glowing object, pulsating and changing color. It appeared to be about the size of a basketball as it hovered over a nearby tree for several minutes. Then it suddenly shot up through the trees at a high rate of speed. It appeared very close - perhaps 200 yards or less - and I could see that it was not a plane or satellite or any kind of known object. As it hovered, it seemed to be about the size of a basketball. It was a beautiful, bright, glowing object, pulsating and changing color from white to yellow to orange. Then it suddenly shot up at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight. My husband and I were both amazed and puzzled by this strange sight. We called a few neighbors and they also saw it. One neighbor got his camera and took a picture, but I don't know if it turned out. 

We cannot explain what it was we saw that night. It did not resemble any known aircraft or satellite. It was a strange, glowing, pulsating object that hovered close by and then shot up at great speed. There was no sound given off. We were both intrigued and a little frightened by this unexpected and unexplained sighting. It was a most unusual and puzzling experience.
