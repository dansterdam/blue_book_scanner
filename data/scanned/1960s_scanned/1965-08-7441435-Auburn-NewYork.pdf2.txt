The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with a series of questions and fields for the witness to fill out.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? (The witness has provided a response to this question).

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (The witness has circled "Yes" to this question.)

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (The witness has circled "Yes" to this question.)

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: No sound
b. Color: Bright white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? (The witness has provided a response to this question.)

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. (There is no drawing or sketch provided in the image.)
