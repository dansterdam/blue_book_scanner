THIS OBJECT WAS ABOUT 25 FEET LONG AND ABOUT 10-15 FEET HIGH. IT WAS SITTING ON A HILL WITH NO OBSTRUCTION TO VIEW. IT WAS SITTING STILL WITH NO OBSERVATION TO THE REAR AND WITH A GLOW TO THE UPPER PART.

I TOOK A WALK THROUGH THE AREA ABOUT 300 YARDS BEFORE THE SIGHTING AND WALKED OVER THE HILL IT WAS SEEN ON. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO ELECTRICAL COMMUNICATION, NO TELEPHONE POLES OR ANYTHING TO CAUSE LIGHTS.
