PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 65-44 . DATED 15 NOVEMBER 1966

Frames #5, #7, #8 and #9 - Once again, multiple moon images indicate that several exposures were used. 

Frame #10 - In frame number 10, it appears as though the camera was swung to two different positions against the background to make two tracings.

Frame #11 - Two, possibly three, exposures were utilized to make this photography as indicated by the doubled background exposures. 

Frame #12 - The spacecraft is in an ideal location and approximately the correct intensity to be an artificial satellite. The highlighted areas on this frame would correspond to the brightest lights on the spacecraft.

Frame #13 - This is again a multiple exposure, with a bright image that is more distinct as in several of the other frames. Once again the door in the central portion for a regular light source.

The report concludes by stating that the furnished materials and photographs do not prove the imagery was deliberately created by the photographer.
