On the night of April 6th, a mysterious object described as a "red streak" crashed into the yard of a resident of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It burrowed into the ground, making a hole about six inches in diameter. The crash was accompanied by a loud noise "like an air raid siren." The next morning, the startled resident and his neighbors dug down five feet below the hole but found nothing.
