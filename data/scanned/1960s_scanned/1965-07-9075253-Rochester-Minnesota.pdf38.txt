The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, with instructions and questions related to sketching and describing observations of an object.

27. In the following sketches, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the horizon line where the object was shown. Place an "B" on the object when you first saw it. Please show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the horizon line where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion path of the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
