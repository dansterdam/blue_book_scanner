AUGUST 21, 1962
CASE 13, AUG. 21, and 22
A witness to the better observed sightings and all occurred at 11:10 PM and AG,
presumably the second pass of the same object. described as 23:23. The beginning
brightness was approximately 3 times as bright as Venus becoming 3/4 altitude 33° diminish
for all and 35° altitude and 33° azimuth for AG. The end points of both these
sightings were respectively for A1 30° altitude, 40° azimuth, and for A2 35°
altitude, 200° azimuth.
Of all these sightings all was the only one that was observed through
a telescope, a scintillator. Three lights were resolved. One bright white light,
a smaller and preceding light, along the vector, separately to see or are from
the other light. Another white light which maintained visibility while lights was
at flight angles, and to the south, of the flight direction and appeared to
go out or die.
There 5 sightings, which in such case occurred about 10 minutes before
each of the A sightings, have the following characteristics: E1 refers to the
first sighting of object B and 82 presumably to the second pass of B1. The time
of the B2 case was approximately 22:15 EDT.
The altitude and azimuth of the B sightings were respectively: B1
beginning, 60° altitude and azimuth largely indeterminate since object was
close to zenith. brightening altitude and azimuth of B2, 70° altitude, 50°
azimuth. The end points of the B1 and B2 projections were respectively for
B1, 45° altitude, 250° azimuth, and for B2 30° altitude and 270° azimuth.
The brightenings of event B sightings were commented upon as of a jellylike
easily visible to the naked eye and all was reported to be of a brightness inter-
mediate between that of Echo and of Jupiter. The sighting occurred 20 miles
southwest of Baltimore, MD.
