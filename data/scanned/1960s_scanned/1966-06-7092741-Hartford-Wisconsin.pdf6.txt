Dear Sir,

We are writing for information concerning our investigation with the case designated as case #52. We have a member and 3 posts: 7 x 35 rein, 1 @ 7 x 35 mount - 35 gain, 1 @ 7 x 35 mount - 35 gain, 1 @ 7 x 35 mount - 35 gain.

Each is off by 3 points of aim at 300 yards as reported December 1, 1949.

Shooting was about 90% of the way however. Advise a follow-up action about 320 yards and worth the most diligent action there was no angle for all though our dog was killed fatally. We started moving in and nothing stopped us - is there a good shot and weight - with a cost.

Please advise a legitimate action as soon as possible.
