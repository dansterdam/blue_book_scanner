The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten text that describes an observation or investigation related to a UFO sighting.

The handwritten text states:

We were watching closely along the 16 at South Gate. Los Angles, California. The entire view was lighted in a flash. Unusual, it was a ciricle of lights. Evidently we saw a center glare with a ring around it. As sure as I'm now a circle glare with lights was seeing. The type of the center and the outer rim now linked into a bright light.

The text also includes a hand-drawn sketch or diagram with the labels "View #1" and "Lights".
