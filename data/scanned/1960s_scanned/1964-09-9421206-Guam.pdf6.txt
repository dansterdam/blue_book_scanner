Subj: U.F.O., sighting of

On 1 Sept 1964, at 11:12, Position 16-39N, 139-59E, I observed what appeared to be a Rocket Reentry, bearing 190 degrees Magnetic from our aircraft, distance unknown. Reentry was from North West toward the South East. A Green Flare was observed very shortly, Bearing 190 degrees magnetic very close to the position. Reentry vehicle made very bright white light illuminating entire area as it crossed from out of our aircraft. As it passed overhead and slightly South the steady white light gave way to a pulsating white light for a brief moment before disappearing from view, apparently burned out. At that time the green flare was notised well to the east of the position the illuminating object fell, and bearing 190 degrees magnetic from our aircraft. Our heading was 120 degrees magnetic, altitude 2500 feet during this time. The weather was scattered Cumulus visibility 15 miles plus.
