ATTN OF:

DEC 28 1965

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI0C (Mrs Hunt)

1. Mr Kenneth A Parks, Lapser County Sheriff, has requested information regarding the identity of some material which he submitted to PFIR.

The following paragraph is provided to assist you with your request:

2. The "fireball" which was sighted by Lapser County residents was also observed by residents in Indiana, Ohio, Southeastern Michigan, and Pennsylvania. There is no connection between the fireball and the material found in Lapser County. The material submitted originated as some type of paper, metallic, and plastic fragments which were dropped by aircraft as a result of the fireball. This was to confuse radar complexes when participating in interdiction exercises. There was gravel for many miles, depending on wind currents and wind velocities.
