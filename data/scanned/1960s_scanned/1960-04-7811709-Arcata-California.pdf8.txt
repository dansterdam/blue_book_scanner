1. Reference copy of attached letter to Director of Intelligence, Department of the Air Force, Washington, D.C., California, from dated 21 April 1960.
2. As mentioned therein, photographs with his correspondence appear to be those of the reported sighting of the object at 2323 hours on 21 April 1960.
3. Analysis of the photograph by the photographic interpretation branch of ATIC led to the conclusion that the image was a defect in the emulsion similar to those which they have experienced.
4. The report expressed that if the AAIC conclusion differed from his own, he is forwarded these photographs together with the data he is suggesting though 12 of his correspondence to direct that the matter be given careful attention.
5. The information states that the configuration and traces of his existing photograph were not clear and the moon or some additional astronomical body was not visible. If this is the basic of his conclusion, this may be due to the photographs of the same phenomenon by 5 or more witnesses was taken with different exposures.
6. From the information provided by your correspondent, concerning his equipment, no further clarification appears to be available. However, most systems which are used for scientific astronomical photography are generally set up for specific purposes, such as lunar photography, planetary photography, etc., and thus two points that can be resolved rather than a linear explanation when motion pictures of a UFO are obtained.
