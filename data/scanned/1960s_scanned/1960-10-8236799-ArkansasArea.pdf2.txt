Dayton, Ohio, has reported that I read 
I you these clippings concerning sighting he most interested in since the Ridge City, Nebraska area. He feels quite sure you would be interested in them.
The clipping is of an article which was published in the Ridge City Star on October 13, 195 , concerning a bright light was seen in the sky over Ridge City on October 12th. The article states that several people who were on the watch for the U.F.O. sightings had reported seeing the bright light.
I feel, in the story of the observer in Dayton, Ohio, you have probably denied sighting the U.F.O. as you felt it to be a sensation. I have written to the editor of the Ridge City Star requesting a copy of the article which he published and hope to obtain a photocopy to forward to you. It would seem strange to me that the radar here would not have picked up the object, if indeed it was visible and of a physical nature. 
I am most familiar with aircraft and I would definitely take this more as a phenomenon than an actual aircraft, unless the radar indicated its nature. I would also consider it a real physical object that would require investigation, if this was a valid sighting. 
Any information you have concerning this or your special UFO Bureau in Dayton would be of special interest to me. Please keep me informed as to other U.F.O. sightings in this area.
Sincerely,
C. D.
