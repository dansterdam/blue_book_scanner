MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND PULL AWAY?
CHANGE COURSE?
GIVE OFF SMOKE OR LIGHT?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLAT OR ROUND IN SHAPE?
DIVIDE INTO PARTS OR SEPARATE?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
TAKE ON DIFFERENT COLORS?
WHAT ELSE DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
Lengthy observation
A saucer shaped object of white light 400 yards away
HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Still in view
