Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your recent unidentified sighting of 7 August 1965. The information given is not sufficient to substantiate the existence of an unidentified flying object. Therefore, I am unable to verify and return it in the envelope provided.

The Air Force appreciates your interest in this subject.

Sincerely,
