Photo #8 is a distant view of the sample's edge shortly after its removal from the freezer. The front surface is to the right and the bottom surface is to the left. The laminar construction is clearly shown. Note also the fine grit imbedded on the water-side layer near the bottom of the picture.

Photo #12 and #15 show the imbedded grit and bubble cross sections with more detail. Note the elongated bubbles; some filled with grit, others filled only with air.

Photo #16 shows the pond looking south from the access road. (The youth who sighted the object for the second time were back a little farther and in the same approximate position when the sighting took place. The object would have been on the bank in the center of the picture if sightings reported it to be.) According to [redacted], however, it would have been to the extreme left of the picture.) The triangular-shaped area described by Deputy Sheriff [redacted] would have been to the left of the picture. Note that the pit had been worked by the highway crew during the week intervening between the sighting and the taking of the photographs. As a consequence, the shape of the pond and surrounding area has been considerably altered.

Photo #17 shows the pond looking towards the east. The first observation of the object was made to the extreme left of the picture.
