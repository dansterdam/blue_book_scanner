The image contains a diagram with a horizon line, a compass, and a path. There appears to be a sketch or drawing showing the motion or movement of an object. However, the image does not contain any photographs.

27. On the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the compass where the high object was above the horizon (daytime) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you saw the object rise high the horizon (nighttime) when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Describe a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" or "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an error to show the direction they took.
