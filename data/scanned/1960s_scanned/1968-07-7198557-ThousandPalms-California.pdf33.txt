Dear Miss Campbell,

Thank you for your letter of March 19, 1968 concerning the UFO sighting which you reported to me on March 18, 1968. 

I have carefully reviewed the details of your report and have determined that it is worthy of further investigation. To that end, I have referred your case to our investigative team for a more in-depth analysis.

You can expect to be contacted in the near future by one of our field investigators who will want to discuss the incident with you in greater detail and possibly arrange a site visit. In the meantime, please feel free to provide any additional information or insights you may have regarding this event.

Thank you again for bringing this matter to our attention. We appreciate your cooperation and look forward to working with you on this case.

Sincerely,
Major Hector Quintana
