The text in the document is as follows:

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

This relates to your letter numbered October 13, in which you state that you had an unidentified aerial object. 

Without additional information, we cannot offer a conclusion if what you saw was a planet, a reflection, or some other natural celestial object. However, the Detachment Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you sight another unidentified flying object (UFO), please provide all details to the nearest United States Air Force unit. The nearest Air Force station, as you will call will be the station and ask for the UFO Officer on duty. He can then initiate action to investigate the sighting.

If possible, he can make an on-the-spot investigation, if this is usually able to achieve a more conclusive result.

In the meantime, you might be well to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects reported as UFOs. In the material we are sending, you will find a list of the more common types.

Sincerely,

JAMES E. ATCMAN
