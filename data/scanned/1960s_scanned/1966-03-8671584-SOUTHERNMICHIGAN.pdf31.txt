It was from these academic gentlemen that I obtained the information
on marsh gas and the lights frequently associated with it. To summarize,
it appears that rotting vegetable vegetation in the swamps produced metbane,
CH4, and H2S in ample quantities under certain conditions. Methane is
odorless, H2S is not but since it is present in relatively small quantities
one does not smell it unless one overturns a shovel full of swamp
material. I am told that this metbane would then release a distinct odor. I am told
In addition, phosphine, PH3, is produced by the reduction of phosphorous compounds
in the marsh material. These three gases are not ordinarily do not spontaneously
ignite. I am told, that a small impurity in the PH3, name Pith, is highly
flammable and when exposed to air spontaneously ignites, which then
apparently can serve to ignite the other gases. The phenomenon of swamp
lights is apparently quite well known, and references to it are ample in
the literature. Even in technical literature these lights, variously as will-o'-the-wisp, ignis fatuus, Fresnee, fox lights, etc, have
had many stories woven around them, including such stories of these lights
being the souls of the departed as well as elemental manifestations of entities.
