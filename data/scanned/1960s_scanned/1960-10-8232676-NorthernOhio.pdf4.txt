AIR FORCE PUBLICATIONS DISTRIBUTION: DIVISION
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C. 

A little over a month ago I ordered a few publications dealing with the Division of Air Force published material bearing on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects. You know, etc. - that is, the same kind of thing you referred me to your office on back in October of last year.

I am extremely interested in this field and have been for some time. I have a strange object some time ago—the details of which I have written you about—and an airport most of my life(?)

The camera has been scrutinized by experts. The indications are, the objects were taken on 35mm film—and we have positive proof that the negatives were not retouched.

These objects are not meteors—they are "things" that appear to be intelligently operated. 
There is no hoax, and we sincerely wish to know just what is happening along these lines. Is this important enough for the Air Force to look into a little further?

Sincerely,
