The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text describing an unidentified aerial object observed in November 1964 in St. Petersburg, Florida.

UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT - November, 1964
When still another caller asked Mr. _____ to check on the case, he scheduled No. 4 on today's schedule.

As I check this case no. 4, it probably considers himself not upon what a conspiracy. In this he and each learned others had a called Mr. an (unidentified aerial object) to confirm as identify and had called Mrs. Dunlap. 

The appelation is attached to is "UNIDENTIFIED" because it is some sort of object that definitely not an aircraft, and it not vet a balloon, and they know of other reasons why it could not be identified.

This definitely not an aircraft, and it is believed that it is not a satellite. The object was not visible for any appreciable length of time.

The sighting last only a matter of seconds. However, this could accept for the bands and while one part of the sky would be obscured another would be visible, but not sufficient to attempt to describe its motion moving object.
