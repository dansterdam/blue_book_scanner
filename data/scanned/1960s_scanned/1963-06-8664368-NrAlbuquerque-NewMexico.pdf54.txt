10 June 1963
Concordia, Argentina

Manuel Peron, member Concordia, Argentina Chamber of Deputies, informed us that a spherical object was detected over the city of Concordia on June 8, 1963. According to the report, the object was observed by several witnesses for more than 3 hours. The object was described as a silvery-bronze color, of unusual shape, and seemed to be the product of an advanced technology. It has no apparent propulsion system and demonstrated smooth, noiseless maneuverability, apparently defying the laws of gravity. This case is suggesting that it is experienced very high temperatures before falling to the ground.
