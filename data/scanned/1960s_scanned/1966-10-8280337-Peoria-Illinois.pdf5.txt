The image appears to contain a page from an old UFO report document, but there is no photograph or image included on this particular page. The text on the page consists of a series of questions and answers related to the sighting of an unidentified object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? NO. It disappeared only in the sense that my backyard has many trees. The object "disappeared" over the treetops beyond my vision.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound - There was no sound. The object seemed to float thru the sky noiselessly. b. Color - The color was bright yellow like a lightning ball.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? The match head would have covered 1/4 to 1/3 times the length. Approximately 2.5-3.5 times the match-head length would have covered the object in length and 1 1/2-2 times the match-head length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The object was clearly defined.
