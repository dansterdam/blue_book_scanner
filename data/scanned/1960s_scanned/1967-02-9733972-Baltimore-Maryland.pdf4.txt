Dear Sirs,
On Monday February 27, 1967, a retired Admiral was on his way to school and sighted what he thought was a military plane or helicopter. However, as he got closer, the object suddenly went into a very rapid acceleration and left the area in a matter of seconds, according to the report. It was not only extremely fast, but the size of a bus or a large truck, the witness stated. 
He gave a very detailed description of the object, which he said had a smooth, metallic appearance and was elliptical in shape or cigar-shaped. It had no wings, propellers, or visible engines. He stated there were no portholes or windows visible on the object either. The witness did not hear any sound from the object. 
The witness expressed that he would very thoroughly appreciate any information your office could provide on this matter.
