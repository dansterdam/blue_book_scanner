LOCAL SIGHTINGS - Cont'd: 
A TYPICAL SITING - On 8/22/52 at about 9:30 p.m. EST, a large white light (apparently 6-8" in diameter) was sighted. It seemed to be stationary about 3,000 ft. up and slightly to the northeast. It was observed for about 5 mins. by a building, on 5th St. The object appeared rather stationary and just hovered in that area. The observer stated that it lowered for about 5 secs., then moved away gradually. (West)
