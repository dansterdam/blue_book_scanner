"29 Dec 68. It was a strange and inexplicable happening. At about 2150 hrs, we were watching tv, when the electricity in the house went off. It came on again about 5 to 10 minutes later. During this time, my wife and I both saw what appeared to be a very bright red light that seemed to be dancing, not too high in the sky, near the edge of our 20 acre field. 
The light was to our right, a little to the west, and was very intense, larger than a star or planet, and appeared to be pulsating or moving erratically. It moved about for several minutes before fading out.
We both felt we were watching a UFO and were fascinated by it.
The weather was clear and cold, and there was no wind. The field was carpeted with about 6 inches of snow, and the house lights and tv set were the only illumination around at the time.
I was just a simple-looking red light, dancing about, much brighter than anything else in the sky. It was just a strange and fantastic-looking sight.
We both felt we were watching a UFO and were fascinated by it.
