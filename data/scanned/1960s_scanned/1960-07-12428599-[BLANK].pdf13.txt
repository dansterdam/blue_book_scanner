MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: Congressman Heistand
1. On 13 June 1960, Col Tucker called Major Friend to inform him that he had been requested to brief Congressman Heistand on the Air Force's UFO program. The reason for the briefing was that Congressman Heistand had a scheduled interview with Dr Harold Salkin, in Salkin's capacity as one of the "supposed" representatives of ASTROLOGY magazine.
Mr Salkin requested the interview to gather information for an article on the UFO subject which is to appear in an early edition of REALITY magazine.
