1. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting: 
None

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
The object was approximately the same location and direction as described in the previous sighting. It appeared to be the same object observed previously. Due to the lone line of observation it was further determined that the object was most likely due to the lone line of observation rather than an actual star. After consulting with a senior navigator it appears that this star was probable.

John W. Carran 
1st Lt. ACDO

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs:
None
