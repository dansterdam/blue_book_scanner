Transcribing the text:

he got on the ground down there, about 20 minutes after landing. He came up to the tower at Palm Beach and we talked to him long distance.

H I see. That's how it was. There was nothing being reported while-- he didn't report anything on tape to Jacksonville Center, did he?

** No sir--now possibly, they're on tape. I would imagine the controller's taped all this.

H I'll perhaps talk with and see what -- I didn't realise this divided itself into two very distinct phases.

** Yes sir, it did. After that Ocala area incident where they saw him on the ground, then apparently they were harassed by him on down. I don't remember exactly, but it seems like they were harassed any after than until they got in the Palm Beach area and we got the radar contact and had them turn 360Â° there on Palm Beach approach.

H And then, of course, one always wonders about the powers of suggestion. They apparently thoughtthe whole incident was over and then they were asked and then they see it, and now it becomes a question of what type of observers they really are. Did they get excited and say "Oh yes, there it is" and mistake some -- on the other hand they did describe its trajectory. It's a hard question to ask you, but from your conversation with them, which lasted how long, altogether?

** Between ten and fifteen minutes. I think it was ten or eleven minutes on the telephone bill.
