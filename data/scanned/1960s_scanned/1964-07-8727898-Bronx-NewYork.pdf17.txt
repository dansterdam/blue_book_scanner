The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing text that describes two sightings of unidentified aerial objects (or "UFOs") over New York City on July 25th and July 30th, 1964.

The text reads:

This is in response to your recent inquiry to the President concerning an object you and your friends observed in the sky over New York City on recent evenings. The President has asked that I reply to your inquiry.

What you undoubtedly observed was the passage of ECHO II. This satellite appeared at 9:29 p.m., EDT, on July 25th, east of New York City, 609 above the horizon, moving northeast. On July 30th, ECHO II appeared at 9:33 p.m., EDT, north of the city, 589 above the horizon, moving northeast.
