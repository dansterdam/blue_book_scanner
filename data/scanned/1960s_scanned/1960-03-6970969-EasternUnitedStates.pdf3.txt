Gentlemen:

This is for the purpose of reporting the sighting of what we saw on March 27, 1960, at approximately 10:00 P.M., in the vicinity of Little Silver, N.J. This is a report from myself and my wife.

On the evening of March 27, 1960, at approximately 10:00 P.M., my wife and myself were on our way home from visiting friends in Asbury Park, N.J. The object appeared midway between Polaris and Cassiopeia and appeared to be silver in nature as it moved in a circular motion for about 30 minutes. The course was generally southerly, so that we viewed it from right to left. The speed seemed very slow and seemed to be at an elevation of approximately 70 degrees from horizontal.

All appeared to be travelling exactly the same course and speed. The course was generally southerly, so that we viewed it from right to left. The speed seemed very slow and seemed to be at an elevation of approximately 70 degrees from horizontal. Whatever it was, it appeared to be climbing very slowly. They were what I would guess to be approximately 15 to 100 miles away from us and no sound relative to this at all.

Several curious after-affects of initial observation, having satisfied myself that they were not a constellation and that they were moving. I called my neighbor's attention to them. He confirmed my observation, and I then called my wife to come up and see and they were. We did not notice at this time any other aircraft in the area. The thing seemed to lower itself to the 7 and vanished after another 5 sec.
