PROJECT BLUE BOOK
The United States Air Force has the responsibility under the Department of Defense for the investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and the gathering of scientific data. Project Blue Book, initiated in 1952, is the continuation of Project Sign and Project Grudge, which preceded it.
Air Force interest in unidentified flying objects is related directly to the defense of the United States. Project Blue Book objectives are to determine if UFOs pose a threat to the United States and, second, to determine the origin of any unusual aerial phenomena which could contribute to scientific or technical research.
In the course of accomplishing these objectives, Project Blue Book strives to identify and examine all UFO sightings reported to the Air Force and thus does not expose available for distribution outside the Air Force Special Report No. 14 and outdated Project Blue Book publications. These military UFO publications should be requested from the publisher and, not the Air Force.
