March 9, 1963

Dear Sir:

I am writing to inform you of an incident which occurred at about 5:00 p.m. on March 6, 1963 in the vicinity of Duluth, Minnesota.

At that time, a shiny metallic object, which seemed to be hovering for a few minutes and then moved away at a very high speed, was observed by several persons, including my daughter and myself.

The object was round or oval in shape and appeared to be of a metallic substance. It did not make any sound that we could detect.

When the object first appeared, it seemed to be hovering about 100 feet off the ground, and then it moved away at an extremely high rate of speed. It was visible for only a few minutes.

I thought you might be interested in this sighting, as I believe it may be of significance. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
[Name Redacted]
