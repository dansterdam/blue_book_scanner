37. WAS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU HAD SEEN AN OBJECT OR OBJECTS LIKE THIS?
37.1 (Circle One) Yes No
37.1 IF YOUR ANSWER IS NO, THEN WHEN, WHERE, AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES DID YOU SEE OTHER ONES?
About 7:30 - 8:00pm the object was first observed hovering about 600-800 feet above the ground, then slowly drifting northward. It appeared to be round or oval in shape and illuminated, giving off a brilliant white-blue light. It seemed to be maneuvering rather than floating. At times it would dim and brighten alternately. I thought it might be a new type of aircraft, but its performance exceeded anything I had seen.

38. IN YOUR OPINION WHAT DO YOU THINK THE OBJECT WAS AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED IT?
I think it was some kind of unconventional aircraft, possibly a new type of US military aircraft, or perhaps an experimental aircraft. Its performance and maneuverability exceeded anything I was familiar with at the time.
