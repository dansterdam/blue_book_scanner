INTERVIEW WITH DEPUTY SHERIFF TERRY ALLMAN

(At this point, it is not clear to me whether officer Allman was with officer Holko when he first investigated the incident. Allman did, however, report the following observations to me:)

1. He made radiation measurements on and around the pond. Results were negative.
2. The phrase used by the youths when they reported the incident to the office was, "Come quick. Its starting to melt." This statement was significant to him and officer Holko as indicating continuing concern on the part of the youths.
3. Allman took samples of the ice and soil and sent them to the King County Sheriff's Crime Laboratory in Seattle. I was referred to a Dr. Fontan for further information.

INTERVIEWER'S COMMENT
Officer investigated a number of UFO incidents on Vashon Island last summer. He reported his findings to NICAP. He appeared to be a capable observer and showed an above average interest in the subject of UFO's.

I am a little disturbed by the fact that officer Holko was unaware of the fact that officer Allman had taken soil and water samples.
