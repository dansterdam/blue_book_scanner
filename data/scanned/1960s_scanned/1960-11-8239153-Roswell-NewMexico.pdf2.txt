Subject: Unidentified Aerial Object Sighted Over Roswell, New Mexico, Oct. 31, 1956.

On the evening of 31 October 1956, this office was notified that an unidentified aerial object had been sighted over the Roswell, New Mexico area. The object was described as a brilliant light, approximately the size of a baseball, which moved erratically from east to west and from west to east at a high rate of speed. The object was observed over a period of approximately 5 minutes by several witnesses before it disappeared from view.

This office has conducted an investigation into the matter and has questioned several of the witnesses. The descriptions of the object given by the various witnesses do not agree in all respects, but there appears to be no doubt that some type of unidentified aerial object was observed.

The United States Air Force has been notified of this incident and a full report will be submitted to higher headquarters. Further investigation into the matter is continuing.
