There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

The text in the document says:

looked exactly like an aircraft landing light from the distance where we were 
and I could tell it was right over, right in the lights of Ocala at an 
altitude of what I would guess to be about 5000 feet, well below us. And 
sitting there, he wasn't moving at all. So when I took my eyes off from 
where we saw the other object disappear, I asked Jacksonville Center if 
they had an object directly over Ocala.

H.  How many minutes was this after the first one disappeared?

C.  It was just at the same time. Just at that very minute. We were 
still talking about the first one, and I came back and I said, "Well, what 
about right over Ocala?" Do you have a target there?" And he said, 
"Negative." And I said, "Well, we have a bright light there,"and in the 
same transmission I said, "And he's moving toward us," and then I just 
hollered at the microphone, "We're on a collision course," and there the 
microphone down to try to take evasive action. This one moved directly 
at us. And I was quite certain that we had victimized by a sideswinder, 
because, and both of us, it scared us to death. We were ready to leave the 
airplane. If we could have. But the thing came straight at us and I'd 
say at 4 distance of, I'd don't know, maybe two miles, you can't tell 
those distances at night, but he made an instantaneous 90Â° left turn and 
at our altitude. Well, I'd wouldn't say just, he was maybe 500 feet below 
us.

H.  How could you be sure, please don't misunderstand me, I'm not doubting 
your word here. I just want to get clear in my own mind, how could you be 
sure of that?
