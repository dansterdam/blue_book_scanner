There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a handwritten letter dated April 6, 1965 from St. Augustine, Florida.

The text in the document is as follows:

Dear sir:
I have wondered what you have meant concerning the landing or sightings of Unidentifiables up there. I am very interested in U.F.O.'s, and if you would send me a report of it, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.
