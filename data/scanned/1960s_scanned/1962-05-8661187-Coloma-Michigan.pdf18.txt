37.1 If you answered NO, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?

39. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
I'm quite certain that this object was not a natural or manmade phenomenon. It behaved in such a strange and unusual manner that it seemed very much to be an unidentified flying object of some kind. The way it hovered, maneuvered, and suddenly disappeared indicated to me that it was not an airplane, missile, or any other object with which I am familiar. It is my belief that this was some type of advanced aerial vehicle, perhaps of extraterrestrial origin. I realize that such claims are often met with skepticism, but I can only report what I saw with my own eyes. This was a highly unusual and puzzling experience that I am unable to fully explain.
