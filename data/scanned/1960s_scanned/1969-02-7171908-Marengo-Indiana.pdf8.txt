IS. WHAT DID YOU ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
It was about 8:45 P.M. last evening, and I was looking out of the south window standing on the top of the steps. I noticed something coming across the sky (it was moving very fast). It was very bright and had no tail, and was shaped like a star. Watch, I thought it was a shooting star. When it got closer, I saw that it was no star. It was a sort of orange-red color, and it changed brightness several times as it came across the sky. Then, it suddenly disappeared.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It just seemed to vanish, like the distant disappearance of an aircraft or spaceship.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
[Checkbox] YES [Checkbox] NO. IF "YES" DESCRIBE.
