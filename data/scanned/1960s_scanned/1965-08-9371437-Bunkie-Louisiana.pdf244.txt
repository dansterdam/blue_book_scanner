UFO Reports Discounted At Field

Object (UFO) reports over eight Western states during sundry nights and early mornings last month have been discounted as prankish, not of alarm, according to Weather-BurNeu Air Force Base Investigate.

The discounting (like some other UFO reports) result of natural phenomena-disturbances or glowing lights in the atmosphere, is based on studies by specialists, including the Weather Bureau, the Air Force and the U.S. Weather Bureau.

The public to stop for alarm, local officials say, and reports on these sundry occurrences will no longer interest the Air Force. The object have been identified in many instances, and in some cases have proved to be weather balloons launched from the Amarillo, Tex., Weather Bureau.

The Chief observer of the Weather Bureau said: "We have not only discounted the sundry lights and general disturbances but have located the planets, stars and lesser objects that sometimes give the impression of a new phenomenon."
