This page does not contain any photographs. The text describes various UFO cases that were reported and investigated as part of Project Blue Book. The key points are:

Only two of the investigated cases reported by telephone to the Air Force described something outside the normal range of observation. One of these cases cannot be followed up further unless more sightings are obtained, while the other may be a helicopter carrying powerful lights.

In conclusion, the available information for cases on or after 21 October contains only one case bearing any resemblance to a "typical" UFO report over the past 20 years, and this case is quite likely just a helicopter carrying search and rescue lights.

Prior to 21 October, several interesting reports were obtained, including a sighting of a bright cylindrical object moving at high speed, observed by an experienced air traffic controller and his assistant.

The text does not identify any individuals and focuses on describing the reported UFO cases and the investigations around them.
