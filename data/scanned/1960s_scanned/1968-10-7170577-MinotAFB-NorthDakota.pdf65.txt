The image provided does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a form with various questions and a handwritten response.

The text on the form is as follows:

DOES IT STAND IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STANDS STILL AT ALL TIMES
SUDDENLY SPEEDS UP AND RUNS AWAY
HOVERS
CHANGES COLOR
BREAK UP INTO SMALLER BITS
CHANGES SHAPE
PLAYS OR BLENDS AWAY
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
BACK A SIGN OF IT
WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

CALLED VERY RADIO. AT APPROXIMATELY 16:50

a. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
The last I saw of it occurred to me descending and the sound I was hearing and the ground of the object disappear. The lights went out and it seemed to go into the clouds.

b. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
Right before the object was gone, the lights went off. The color of the object was blue-green and it made a strange HUMMING sound that was departing.
