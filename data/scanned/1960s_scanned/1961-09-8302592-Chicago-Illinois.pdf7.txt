There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a historical document, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

"Dated 14 September
Saucer-shaped object
Diameter 15-20 feet
Altitude 500-600 feet
Speed 600-700 mph
Shape bright glowing object
Seen by numerous observers
Heading northwest
Moving very rapidly
Passed overhead at high altitude
Just a bright light at that distance
Broke into two parts
Then disappeared"
