April 3. 1962

I wish to take this opportunity to comment on an incident which I, as a flight observer, could have the proper identification of, if I had been able to obtain a photograph of the object.

On the evening of March 31, 1962, at approximately 8:50 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, I observed a bright light, an object similar in size to a starlike object, traveling in a northeast direction at a great rate of speed. This object gave off a bluish-white light, seemed to be spinning and momentarily disappeared behind a tree. Upon reappearance, it maintained a steady course for about 10 to 15 seconds, then suddenly disappeared. This sighting lasted approximately 30 to 40 seconds.

I am aware of the fact that a number of unidentified sightings have occurred lately in the Tampa Bay area, and hope that my report will be of some value. If additional information is required, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Very truly yours,
