The image does not contain any photograph or image. It appears to be a scanned document containing typed text. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and output the text found in the document:

Practically every word for a loud noise was tried out, and was still not quite right. Finally the investigator who had been previously some aircraft sightings made a noise at about 9 above Middle C, a steady and loud falsetto note with a "burr" in it, which represented his estimate of what the others had heard. He remarked "That is to what I heard!" He remarked several times how surprised he was that the exact sound should have been reproduced so closely. "You couldn't t have done that, even!" He stated that he had not similar experiences.

The Chief then mentioned several other people who, after being questioned, had made some statements about what they had heard, so their investigators will report on those sightings.

Further evaluation is deferred to the end of this report.
