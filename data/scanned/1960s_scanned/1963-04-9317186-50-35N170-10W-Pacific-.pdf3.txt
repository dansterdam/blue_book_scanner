GLOBAL SIGHTINGS
SAT DIEGO, CALIF.--The San Diego Union-Tribune carried an article entitled: "Flash in the Sky" a Satellite?"
Several hundred persons in San Diego, and as far east as El Paso, Texas, saw a satellite flash and lights in the sky. Fort Hancock, Texas and other places reported similar sightings. The U.S. Strategic Air Command stated that its IRBM (ICBM) reported a bright flash, but whatever it was began to tumble, and the color changed from brilliant white to orange and red. It was suggested that it might have been the routine launch of a satellite, but would not discount the possibility of an allied satellite being launched. The sighting occurred at about 7:35 P.M. (PDT) and the color that would account for the change of color after the flash was reported.
