The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch shows several numbered objects or shapes on what seems to be a horizontal line or surface. The text above the sketch states "Saucer 18 sighted to left view 13 yr old boy in right seat who lies hour 30-40M". This suggests the drawing is an attempt to depict a UFO sighting by a 13-year-old boy.

Here is the text from the document, which appears to be a report on the UFO sighting:
