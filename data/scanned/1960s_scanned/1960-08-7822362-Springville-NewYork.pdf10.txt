"It was a very bright night and the weather was clear we were returning to our car which was parked on a hill. As we approached the car we saw a bright light in the sky. This light seemed to be stationary at first. As we watched the light suddenly took off at terrific speed, going up and down and from side to side. This went on for about 10 minutes or so. Then the light just disappeared. We were very amazed at what we saw. We could not make out what the object was. It was a very strange sight and we have no explanation for it. 

D. your let us know what you can find out about this incident in Springville, New York. We would be most interested to hear from you on this matter. Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely yours"
