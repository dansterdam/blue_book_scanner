The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, discussing the Socorro, New Mexico UFO incident from 1964.

Transcribed text from the document:

Perhaps I spent too much time on this matter, but the letter was a very convenient device for re-discussing the whole situation. Sgt. Chaves indicated that Menzel should have been a science fiction writer. Actually Lyle Boyd has done some of this, and I believe also Menzel has.

I left Albuquerque in the late morning on Saturday and arrived in Socorro about 1:00 P.M. Raynor, Shrode, and I visited the site and took some more samples, particularly of the sap, and I took a few more pictures, particularly of the dynamite shack to show Menzel. Then I went back to the radio station.
