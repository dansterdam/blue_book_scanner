HANDWRITTEN TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

A descending, brightly lit air object was observed over a highway near Bryte, California about 8:15 p.m. on June 9, 1965. The object appeared to be about 70 feet in diameter and emitting alternating light beams of a bluish-white color. The object descended slowly, then shot upwards at a high rate of speed, disappearing from view. The witness called the Air Force, who said it was a routine aircraft. The witness insisted it was not a normal aircraft but something very strange. No further investigation or explanation was provided.
