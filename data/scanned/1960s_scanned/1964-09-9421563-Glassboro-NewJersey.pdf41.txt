On 13 sep 64, this office received a telephone call from Capt Ewing, 6570th Aer Rec Sq, Ladd AFB, Alaska. He advised that he had received reports of unidentified flying objects in the Glassboro, New Jersey area. This office was informed that three objects were observed for approximately 30 minutes. They were described as bright lights which moved rapidly from one location to another. One object was described as "pulsating" and appeared to go through some sort of change or transition. They were observed from approximately 1900 to 1930 hours.

This office has sent three officers and photographer to scene to investigate. They will be assisted by personnel of the FAA at Atlantic City, N.J., for consultation. We will submit any metal samples, if any are recovered, for analysis.
