The next day we started out earlier and decided that we going to return there and see what we could see in the daylight. It took us two hours from the bottom of the hill to get to the top of the hill in broad day light. We saw this

there was no sign of life. there were no fuses in the fuse box there was no machinery in operation. There were no signs. inside one of the domes there was a typewritten sign that said this property stolen from somebodys garage in snohomish. It wasnt scary in the day light and looked as if it were a tv relay station or something. I called every one that we could think of that would verify that there was something there and no one would admit to it. One engineer asked me what time of day it was and I told him it was 10:30 at night. He said "are you crazy" and hung up. Well you can see why we were and are afraid to mention to many of these things to the wrong people. Ok You tell us what it was and what it is and we will be satisfied that we are a bunch of nuts that are looking for some excitement (to fill up the emptiness of our lives) that has been suggested by people that cannot take the time to look, listen, or hear.

The next interesting thing that I can think of was "The star that stood still". My nephew, my self a 20 year old neighbor girl and our daughter were sitting on the roof watching the skies we watched this brilliant star for at least 2 and a half hours. when much to our surprise and fright before our eyes it began to fly away. It traveled east toward the peak of the mountains that we can see from our roof. It appeared to fly around the mountain at least it would disappear and reappear at various points along the peak of the mountains.
