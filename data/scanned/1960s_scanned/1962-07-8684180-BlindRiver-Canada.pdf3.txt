July 21, 1962

Dear BSO-
This was just received today. Someone seems quite eager over this observation, and they've inquired about having a reply in a hurry. At the moment I don't feel too eager, but I think I had better get this off. It's a bit of a bother, but I'll do my best to be helpful.
(1) No photograph - this sighting seems visual only.
(2) Observer reports:
July 8, 1962, Blind River, Canada, 11:27 pm. Object first seen hovering over lake, then moved rapidly away. Described as round, glowing object, no sound, 2-3 minutes duration.
(3) Observer wants to know if this sighting compares with any known or reported observations. Also asks whether it might represent any known type of aircraft.
I hope this summary is of some use. Let me know if you need any other information.
Sincerely,
[Signature]
