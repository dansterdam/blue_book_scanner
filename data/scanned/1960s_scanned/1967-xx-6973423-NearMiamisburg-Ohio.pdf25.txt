The image contains two photographs. 

The first photograph is a compass rose diagram with directional labels. This diagram appears to be instructional, providing guidance on how to use the compass rose to indicate the direction of an observed phenomenon.

The second photograph shows two sketches. The larger sketch depicts a landscape with a road or path leading towards a distant horizon. There is a small figure standing in the foreground. The smaller sketch shows a more distant, hilly landscape.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text in the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "O" ON THIS COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH IT WAS HEADING TO.

2. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. BE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS IMPORTANT AS IT WILL ALLOW US TO CALCULATE THE SPEED AND DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON.
