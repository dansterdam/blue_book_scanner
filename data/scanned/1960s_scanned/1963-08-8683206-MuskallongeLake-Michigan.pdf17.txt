The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text appears to be a written report or account of some kind. I will now proceed to transcribe the text contained in the document:

The witness reports seeing a luminous object over the lake on the above date. He states that he was fishing on Muskallonge Lake in northern Michigan when he saw a bright light in the sky approaching his location. The object appeared to be oval in shape and was hovering approximately 500 feet above the water. After observing the object for several minutes, it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. The witness further states that the object made no sound and emitted no exhaust or trail. He reports that the sighting lasted for about 5 minutes.
