Text from the document:

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT. SUCH AS A LAMP ON THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. HOW LONG HAS ALL TO BE PERSON TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. ESTIMATE AT WHAT FRACTION OF THE MOON'S DIAMETER THE OBJECT APPEARED.
