My Dear Friend re the sightings at Red Bluff California , 13 August, I960
was retraction of the planet Mars and the two bright stars, Aldeberan and Betelgeuse. (This was his first conclusion and he was waiting for weather information to see if that conclusion is still correct). There were not only inversions but on some days double inversions. Feals positive that the original conclusion is that as stated above.
In instances where people say that they start driving toward the object that is a great distance away, it always gives you the impression of its being close with you without accurate estimate equipment. The angular variations are such too small for them to cover.
