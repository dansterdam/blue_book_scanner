Transcription of the text:

9) Apparent size - 1/4 to the length of the diameter of moon, at the time it was observed passing the view of the observer. The size of the object appeared to be from 1/4 to 1/2 the width of the adult hand held at arm's length viewing.

The width of the UFO could have been obscured from view partly, as the edge could not be clearly distinguished from a point due north the craft appeared to come on the scene. It appeared to slow down to a point where it was going to hover or stop, and the object also appeared to slow down and to come closer to the observer, and then it went away rapidly. The brightness of the light from the object became much brighter, and the UFO disappeared behind a hill. When the UFO reappeared, the intensity of the fire one was about 1/4 that of the initial intensity.
