The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

The text visible in the document is as follows:

"The rather unusual picture comes to this picture that was found around 1.5 miles in the direction of Woodbridge, RJ. 8.15p.m. The report states that he was watching the stars about 1/2 mile away from the airstrip of the Bridgeport, OF Airport when he observed the objects appear and remaining stationary for several minutes before disappearing very rapidly. He states that he has had the experience of seeing this incident occur on several occasions and that he has reported this phenomenon to the authorities in the past. The pictures were taken with a Brownie Hawkeye camera using standard 620 film. The report further states that the picture depicts the facts as the witness observed them within the time in question."
