Gentleman: 
A report was made of what I would call a "flying object" at 9:15 p.m. - The time I saw it was 3:30 a.m. 4/19/67. The object, according to the report, was very low and seemed to be traveling at a fast rate of speed between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m. The object was observed by several people in the Murfreesboro, North Carolina area. It is difficult to tell what the object was, as it seemed to be changing directions and altitude very rapidly. It is assumed to be a strange phenomenon of some kind. I saw the object and I can assure you it was a real object - not a star or planet. When I turned to look at it, it disappeared from view within a very short time. I had a red flashlight and I tried unsuccessfully to get the object to hover and let me look at it more closely, but it would not. I am convinced it was not an airplane, helicopter, or other known object. I am reporting this incident for whatever it may be worth.
Sincerely, 
[Signed] 1/64
