DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20330

August 2, 1967

Dear Ray:

I appreciate the copy of Lt. Marley's briefing, and we sincerely appreciate your interest and response to our public affairs problem with UFOs. I think we are a long way from solving a handle on this problem.

I have thought about the problem many times since your briefing. I am more convinced than ever that a positive program in extra-terrestrial life or communications studies should not be tied to the UFO problem. 

I know you don't agree with this and I am not sure Bill Bollendinere does either. However, I am convinced that we need to take the public flash on UFO problems if the public ever is to be convinced that the US government is trying to involve itself in this matter.

I realize that Condon must address this subject, but this is different from conducting active research. I think research in this area should be accomplished by an entirely unrelated activity.

Please pass on any ideas you have and keep us alerted in any way that we might help.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM C. GARLAND
Brigadier General, USAF
Director of Information

Colonel Raymond S. Sleeper
Commander
Foreign Technology Division (AFLD)
