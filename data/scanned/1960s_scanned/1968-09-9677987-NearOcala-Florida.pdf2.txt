This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. Instead, it appears to be a transcript or record of an interview or conversation regarding a reported UFO sighting near Ocala, Florida.

Let's see. They left lease that long.

Oh yes. Here is says "Jacksonville Center couldn't pick it up on radar. We followed him until we were almost to Ocala, and he disappeared off into the sky on a heading of something like 200Â° and then as we approached Ocala there was an object. At first it was a white light. It was hanging right over Ocala"--where is Ocala?

Do you know where Gainesville is? (Yes) Directly southeast of there.

Fine. And then he said, "It was hanging right over Ocala and just as I finished reporting the other one this one came right at us. We were on a collision course. I would say he missed us about 1 mile. He came straight at us in an angle. We were about 15 miles out of Ocala still on a heading of 120. This object came straight at us in a climb attitude then turned right in front of us to the west. He went out about 15 miles west of Ocala and just hung there at an altitude of 9000, I would guess that he was at probably 6000 or 7000 ft."

What are the chances do you think, Captain, that these fellows were sufficiently poor observers to have mistaken stars at various times? Of course, they were on a straight course at that time, they were not making maneuvers.

I'm not a firm believer in UFO's and I've never observed anything like this, but from the way they verbally talked to me, I would say they saw something.
