The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing mathematical equations and text discussing various physical phenomena and theories related to the disturbance function, zero frequency, and the relaxation of the quasi-isotropic distribution.

Furtheron we note the following special cases:
a) Zero frequency: the disturbance function becomes
Xoo = Ke-ax* [1 + Ma2/6RT (x*-3/2)] (96)
The temperature T'= T[1 + Ma2/12RT (a/e)*] = T[1 + Ma2/6RT] (96a)
b) Zero frequency, zero magnetic field. We put w = 0, y = 0 so that z = 0.
Xoo = Ke-x* [1 + 2a/12 M (x*-3/2)] (97)
with a RT = RT or a = z(a/e)
The relaxation of the quasi-isotropic is little influenced by the movement of the ions. We may write:
S = Ke-x* [1 + 3/4x* + Ma2/6RT (x*-3/2) + 3/8a2/2(3z=2x*)]
Conclusions
The disturbance function was found as a development in terms of series in powers of the electric field strength. The magnetic field leads to complications involving the anisotropic terms in Qm.
In the presence of an electric field it is possible to show clearly how an isotropic distribution is re-established; starting from an arbitrary non isotropic distribution the an isotropic distribution is attained after some relaxation processes have taken place which take a time >/~ characteristic of the order k of anisotropy. An initial isotropic distribution can be decomposed into a Maxwellian-component Yo and non Maxwellian components Yp, p#0 which relax with relation times of an order of magnitude (Ma/12RT)~p, the much more slowly than the anisotropies.
In the presence of an electric field the anisotropies are represented by spherical functions Yp with amplitudes proportional to (E/Em)p (where Em)
