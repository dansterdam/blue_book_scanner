RECEIVED 15 AUG 1968
TO: LOU CHERNIN
FROM: DANIEL CHRISMAN
SUBJECT: INCIDENT REPORT

On 8 August 1966, at approximately 2230 hours, I was driving alone in my personal vehicle on Highway 611 near Philadelphia, PA. As I approached the intersection of Highway 611 and Blair Mill Road, I observed a bright light in the sky, approximately 150-200 feet above the ground. The light appeared to be circular in shape and extremely bright, illuminating the entire area.

As I continued to observe the light, it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from view. At no time did I observe any solid structure or object associated with the light. The light simply appeared and then vanished.

I immediately stopped my vehicle and contacted the local police department to report the incident. The police responded and questioned me regarding what I had observed. I provided them with a detailed account of the event.

This incident was subsequently reported to the United States Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, the official government program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs). I was later contacted by representatives of Project Blue Book and provided a further statement regarding my observations.

To the best of my knowledge, this incident was thoroughly investigated by the Air Force and determined to be of an unknown origin. No satisfactory explanation was ever provided for the bright light that I observed.

I hope this report provides the necessary details regarding the incident. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
DANIEL CHRISMAN
