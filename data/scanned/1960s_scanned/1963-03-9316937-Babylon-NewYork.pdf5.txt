16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
    (Circle One):  Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
    a. Sound____________________________________
    b. Color____________________________________

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length in the direction of the object. If you have performed this act, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the position and size of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusion, etc., and especially the direction of the object's motion.
