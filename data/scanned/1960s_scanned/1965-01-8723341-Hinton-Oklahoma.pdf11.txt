The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, containing text describing an incident where some boys claimed to have seen a UFO.

The text reads as follows:

Boys See UFO

Five boys claim they saw a UFO during their lunch period on January 8, 1965 in Glover Park, Washington, D.C. They claim they saw a bright light in the sky and that their teacher told them after school that evening. He had told his school teacher that the principal had an opportunity to question his sons friend during lunch, who had also seen the object. The teacher interrogated the boys and found their stories consistent.

The next day Jordan was reminded of the incident by his friend. Jordan then questioned his son's other encounters with the boys, and whose description tallies with Christopher's. However, the objects seen by the boys were not weather balloons, but the inability to identify the object with certainty does not mean it was a UFO. The sighting is merely a lack of talent.
