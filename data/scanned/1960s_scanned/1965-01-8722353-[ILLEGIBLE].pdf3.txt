Dear Major:

There are several things I want to talk about: 
1. I have an unexplained sighting of a bright object, apparently at 6 o'clock on Wednesday April 28. It was very brief - about 5 seconds - because I was watching the television and caught a glimpse of it out of the corner of my eye. It appeared to be traveling from the east to the west across the northern part of the sky. Without warning it accelerated rapidly and disappeared. I would appreciate any information you can give me about this sighting, or any other sightings in this general area during that time period. 
2. I have been studying the UFO problem intensively for some time now and feel I have come to some interesting conclusions. If you are interested, I would be happy to discuss these with you.
