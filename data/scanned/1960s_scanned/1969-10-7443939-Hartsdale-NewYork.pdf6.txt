The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left is a compass rose, with directions labeled around the perimeter. The smaller sketches on the right appear to be illustrations of a UFO sighting, with a person standing and looking up at a UFO-like object in the sky.

Transcribed text:
"HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A Y ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
THE SKETCH SHOWN PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A Y AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. ALSO INDICATE WITH ARROWS BOTH THE SIZE AND DIRECTION OF MOTION OF THE OBJECT. AN OBJECT APPEARING TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH."
