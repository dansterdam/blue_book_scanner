No Case (Information Only)

11 October 1960
Anaheim, California

The individual sighted what he believed to be a strange, unusual, and unidentified object in the sky. He could not determine its size, shape, or altitude, and he could not identify it as any type of known aircraft. The object was spotted for only a few seconds before it disappeared from sight. There were no other witnesses, and no further details could be obtained.
