William J. Feyorian, Pound Ridge, N.Y., reported seeing a saucer-shaped object, approximately 20-25 feet in diameter, which passed overhead at a normal speed and appeared to be at an altitude of 500-600 feet. The object had a brillant glow, was very steady in its course, and appeared to be 15-20 feet in thickness from the bottom view. 

On Sunday, August 15, 1965 at approximately 4:10 p.m. I was in my home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. 3 year old daughter was playing outside, when she came in and said, "Daddy, look at the thing in the sky." I immediately went outside and observed the object for approximately 3 minutes. It was traveling in a westerly direction at a normal speed and an altitude of 500-600 feet. The saucer-shaped object had a brilliant glow and was very steady in its course. It appeared to be 15-20 feet thick from the bottom view. There was no sound associated with the object. Gradually the object moved out of sight and disappeared over the horizon. From the point of first sighting to its disappearance it was approximately 3 to 4 miles. I was unable to distinguish any windows, ports or markings on the object. This flying object crossed the entire countryside in a straight and level course and disappeared over the horizon to the west. I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this report. Thank you.
