Ua.the shape o√Ñ the object waa very claar. Moat 
probably it was some kind of craft. Thaobjact 
waa dark against the sky and wae travelling at a 
fairly high altitude. It appeared larger than a 
normal aircraft and seemed to be travelling at a 
rapid rate of speed. I watched it for a few
minutes and then it disappeared. I most certainly 
cannot explain what this object was.
