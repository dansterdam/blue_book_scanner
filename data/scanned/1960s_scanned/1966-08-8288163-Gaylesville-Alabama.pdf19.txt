The image contains a diagram and explanatory text related to a UFO sighting. The diagram depicts the movement and position of a "center light" or "object" that was observed, including the estimated point of equilibrium and the most forward and aft positions of the center light. The text provides details about the sighting, such as the frequency of the object's movements and the witness's perspective on the event. No human faces are visible in this image.

When "lights" passed over the car (station wagon), I first saw them. The figure being in 45 degrees to the north (center line of car), they were of a bluish color and varying in size from about the size of a dime to that of a silver dollar, occurring in rapid succession, with a frequency of about 2 cycles per second. (Notice that the object was single formed by the leading light.)

Figure 3.

As viewed when looking slightly directly straight up. 

Most forward position of center light.

Estimated point of equilibrium.

Most aft position of center light.

The dotted circles show limits of movement of center ("object") light. When in the more forward position, as shows in the figure above, the center light "overlapped" the leading light. When this occurred there was a "blink" as shown below.

My wife and I are both positive of this.
