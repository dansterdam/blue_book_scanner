Dear Sgt. Moore:

Thank you very much for your assistance concerning the recent UFO activity in Oklahoma. Your explanations certainly helped clarify my understanding of how the Air Force handles the UFO program.

As you will note in the attached letter, I simply advised the NICAP that no FAA radar tracked UFOs on the date and location referred to in their letter.

Thanks again for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
K. E. Jones
Public Affairs Officer
