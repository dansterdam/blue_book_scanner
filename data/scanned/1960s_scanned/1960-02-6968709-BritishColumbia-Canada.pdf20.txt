NOT OTTAWA POLICE MATTER.
REGINA, CANADA

Sirs:

Please be advised that the ATHABASCA INDIANS near FORT McMURRAY, Alberta, in western Canada, recently reported seeing a strange object in the sky.

According to recent reports from a group of Indians in the area, the object was described as a bright light, which hovered over the Athabasca River for about 15 minutes, and then moved off at a high rate of speed. The Indians state that the object may have made a sound, possibly a 'hissing' sound, but this is said to be unreliable.

The RCMP is of the opinion that this appears to be another UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) that has been seen in the area of Athabasca, Alberta. Previous reports of UFO sightings in this district have been received by the RCMP.

The object is said to be approximately 20 miles from FORT McMURRAY, Alberta, (N.W.T.) in the northwest.

P.S. Data read, via mail - GRAY comes messenger car. ATHABASCA Indians is NOT an OFFICIAL REPORT that this DAYLIGHT OBSERVER/SIGHTING should be looked into further by official channels. This was an UNOFFICIAL report put into this office by a private person, but should not be disregarded, as it may contain useful data."
