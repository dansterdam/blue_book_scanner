Investigator: Sgt. S. Curtis Claver, 8920 51st Ave., Elmhurst, N.Y.
Date: 14 Sept. 1964
Witness: Arnold B. Campton, Deerfield, 22 July 1964

This report has been prepared from information provided by the witness at the time he reported the incident. The witness is considered a reliable and credible source.

The incident occurred on 22 July 1964 at approximately 2330 hours. The witness, Arnold B. Campton, was driving his automobile northbound on Route 47 near Glassboro, New Jersey. As he approached an intersection, he observed a large lighted object hovering over the roadway, approximately 300 feet ahead of him.

The object was described as being about 100 feet in diameter, silhouetted against the night sky. It appeared to be chrome in color and was illuminated from within, emitting a bright white light. The object was observed to hover motionlessly for a period of about one minute before it suddenly accelerated in a vertical direction, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.

The witness stated that the object was completely silent and that there was no evidence of any exhaust or propulsion system. He further reported that the illumination from the object was so intense that it completely illuminated the surrounding area, enabling him to clearly see the road and countryside. He stated that he experienced no physical effects as a result of the encounter and that his automobile operated normally throughout the incident.

The witness is considered a reliable and credible individual. His report appears to be a straightforward and honest account of what he observed. No other witnesses have been identified at this time, and there is no physical evidence available for examination. The case is presently classified as "unidentified".
