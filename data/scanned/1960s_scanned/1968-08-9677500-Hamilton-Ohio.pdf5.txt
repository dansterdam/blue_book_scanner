The image contains two sketches or illustrations, but no photograph. The larger image appears to be a compass or directional diagram with various labels and annotations. The smaller images depict two silhouetted figures standing in a landscape.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text from the document as requested:
