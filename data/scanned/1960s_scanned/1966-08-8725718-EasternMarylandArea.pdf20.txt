The image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it appears to be a page from a UFO report document that includes illustrations and written instructions.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.

28. Draw a picture of the terrain that you were looking at, including the horizon. Place an "X" at the point where the object was first sighted, and a "Y" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
