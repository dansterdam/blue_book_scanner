UFO Recovered at Dover AFB, Delaware 
29 October 1965

FTD (TDRA) (USO)

1. Reference Telcon between Maj Moody and MSgt Formander on 25 October 1965. I was notified that the object could be examined. After discussing the matter with Lt Col Peyton, our decision was to conduct the examination and identification on the 29th of October 1965.

2. After notifying FTD (TDRA) on 21 October 1965 that the object would be sent to them for identification, we received a phone call from Maj Hill, requesting us to hold the object for purposes of examination by members of the FTD (TDRA). Maj Hill stated, they desired to make the identification themselves. A team, consisting of a balloon manufacturer, Mr. Coleson, company engineer, and Mr. Arnold, arrived to make positive identification.

3. On 29 October we received a call from Mr. Bob Long of NASA Operations, Wallops Island Station, Va. Mr. Long stated that the balloon through the recovery of which the object was recovered, was a similar one manufactured by the Schjeldahl Co. He said a check could possibly indicate a relationship to the 20 October incident, and the UFO that we informed him of, that a representative from the Schjeldahl Co. had indicated was their balloon. We informed Mr. Long that a representative from the Schjeldahl Co. had already arrived and was making the identification.

4. Further information on the status and ownership of the balloon can be obtained by calling Mr. Bob Long at Wallops Island Station, Va. Phone 703 (824-3411 ext 2522).
