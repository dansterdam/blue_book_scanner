Insufficient Data: Witness provided all data requested but data was not of a sufficient quality to enable an evaluation. The objects observed were like a white cloud and like a mirror. The first object broke up, the last object did not. The objects travelled from North to South, made no sound, and turned or reversed direction. The objects were like golf balls and then split into two smaller ones which looked like golf balls. MAXCE refers to much was observed.
