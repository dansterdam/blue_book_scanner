NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

18 MAY 1963
CLEVELAND, OHIO

LOCAL SIGHTINGS:
SHALANGA FALLS, OHIO - Sat. May 18, 1963
At about 10:45 PM a restaurant worker at Shalanga Falls, Ohio, stopped outside during a restaurant break. He observed a round reddish-orange object which remained stationary for about 15 seconds. He described the object edges as uniform reddish-orange color, and though more brilliant than a condition (traffic) light, was "like a silver dollar," but upon close questioning, the object was determined to have been about the size of a silver dollar at arm's length.
After watching it for what he thought was approximately 15 seconds, the object moved to a position directly to the southeast, where it disappeared at a fast rate of speed, going straight East.
The witness, a male approximately 25 years old, was alone when the observation took place. The object was estimated as overhead at 20 degrees elevation, and about 1/2 mile distant. From the data it would seem that the 25-second observation was in the neighborhood of the intensity as described, just instantaneous disappearance.

DETROIT MILITARY BULLETIN:
We reported an object sighted by two military observers at 2:02 AM EDT on May 18, 1963, over Ravenna, Ohio. That object was determined to be a satellite re-entry scheduled at that time and place under normal atmospheric conditions.
