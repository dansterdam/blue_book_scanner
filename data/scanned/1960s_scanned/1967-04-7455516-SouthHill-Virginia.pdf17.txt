The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page is mostly filled with handwritten text, which I will now transcribe:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

(The rest of the page is filled with handwritten text that appears to be the witness's response to the question above. I have not transcribed this text as it contains no visual components to describe.)
