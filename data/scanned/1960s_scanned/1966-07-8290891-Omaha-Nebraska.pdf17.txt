THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED ON 8 JULY 1966 BY A CREW OF THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD SWITCH ENGINE, OMAHA, NEBRASKA
THE CREW MEMBERS WERE CHECKING FREIGHT CARS ON A SIDING IN OMAHA WHEN THEY NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY. IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 40-50 FEET IN DIAMETER AND HOVERING APPROXIMATELY 750 FEET ABOVE THEM. THE LIGHT SEEMED TO EMANATE FROM THE OBJECT AND THERE WERE NO VISIBLE WINGS OR OTHER PROTRUSIONS. THE OBJECT MAINTAINED ITS POSITION FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES AND THEN SUDDENLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. THE WITNESSES WERE VERY CERTAIN OF WHAT THEY SAW AND REPORTED IT TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES IMMEDIATELY. THEY WERE DESCRIBED AS SOBER, RELIABLE WITNESSES.
