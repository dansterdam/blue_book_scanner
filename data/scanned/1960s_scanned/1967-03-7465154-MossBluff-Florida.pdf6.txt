Dear sir:

I would like to report a UFO sighting Danny Harber and I made a month ago.

It was about 8:00 p.m. We watched it for about 3 minutes near Moss Bluff, Florida. It was a clear night with a full moon about 80 to 85 degrees above the horizon. It was just one object. It appeared solid, like a sketch of it:

It was moving three times as fast as a plane. It gave off a bright glow.
