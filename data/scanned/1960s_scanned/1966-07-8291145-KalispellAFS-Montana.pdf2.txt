The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, with various questions and fields for the observer to fill out.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Faded from vieW in a descending spiral of smoke.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered Yes, go to Item 16.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered Yes, go to Item 17.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Wave
b. Color White light

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object. Measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Approx 1/32 the size of full moon.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the direction from which you first saw such as winds, prominences, etc., and especially whether trails or beams of light were seen.
(The handwritten drawing appears to be a rough sketch of a glowing, saucer-shaped object with some swirling or spiral trails behind it.)
