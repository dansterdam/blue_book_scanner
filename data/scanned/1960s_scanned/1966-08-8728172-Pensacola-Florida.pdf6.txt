The image appears to contain a hand-drawn illustration rather than a photograph. The illustration depicts the motion of an object or objects, showing a path with a directional arrow and an annotation describing the motion as "DIVING DOWN AND AWAY FROM US." There is also a compass rose diagram in the upper right corner of the image.

THE MOVING OBJECT DIVING DOWN AND AWAY FROM US
IT MIGHT HAVE GONE ONLY HALF WAY. COULD ONLY TELL FROM TOP
