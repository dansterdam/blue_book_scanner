The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, specifically the document with the filename "1966-08-8727534-Harvard-Mass.pdf13.txt".

Text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 21 April 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Sightings was similar to the usual cover of a UFO, in the spittle of head trails of light particles. It moved fast toward a blinding at full-wide open that lasted not longer than one-half minute. No motion afterwards till it vanished in the cloud cover at a tempestuous moment. Mass Rt. 11:22 and Mass Rt. 11:11.
Note: I am trying to determine an effective position and describe sighting, which affect only a short time from C.B.S. Army Post. The effects be determine from Weather Bureau data on height of clouds during the storm.
