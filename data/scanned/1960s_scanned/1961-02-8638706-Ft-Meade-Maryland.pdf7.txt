Memo, AFCIN-4E, 6 Apr 61, Request for Evaluation of UFO Report
1st Ind (AFCIN-4612/Maj. Oliveros/jc/7/2011) 12 May 61
TO: AFCIN-4E (Maj. Friend)

1. A final evaluation cannot be made on the basis of the limited information submitted. Since no temperature data below 10,000 ft. is available, there is no evidence of a specific condition considered essential for visual or instrument detection. However, the observer states that the weather was "ceiling and visibility unlimited." It is very likely that a temperature inversion conditions existed, which may be appropriate for consideration. Lack of specific information on the behavior of the object precludes definite analysis, since the behavior is the major factor for detection of a radar beam. Since the behavior of the reported UFO is synonymous with this type of failure to track, it is difficult to determine validity of the report.

2. As is the case with all reports of this type, the possibility of equipment malfunction causing the false target cannot be ruled out completely.
