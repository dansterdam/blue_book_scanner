MAY 16 1967

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

Reference your recent letter concerning your unusual observation of March 31, 1967.

I want to assure you that the Air Force has never called anyone to report a "secret" or honest observation of something sighted in the sky. When the Air Force decides to investigate a UFO report, this is done quietly as not to excite public interest in the individual. For this reason we do not release the names of observers without their permission.

The description of your sighting is very consistent with those reported of hot air balloons. The Air Force has been plagued with reports of unidentified objects which turn out to be a variety of known objects such as aircraft, balloons, and satellites. In flight, balloons often appear to provide a platform for candles of some type. This is, of course, only a possible explanation; however, your description is quite similar to past reports which have been positively identified as hot air balloons.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
