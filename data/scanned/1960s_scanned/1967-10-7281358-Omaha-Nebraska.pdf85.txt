Dear [redacted],

This will reply to your letter of October 8, regarding your two sightings of UFOs.

The first happened so long ago, and so many details need to be verified, that positive identification is not possible at this point. Identification would be virtually impossible.

The second sighting was more recent; however, necessary details are missing. Description of the object, if you would care to determine this, would be helpful. In the envelope we are enclosing, to the address given on the envelope, we shall try to determine what you observed.

In the future, should you sight another UFO, please contact the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately. By so doing, you will have a much greater chance of having a detailed lighting identification.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STUBBSS
Major, USAF
Acting Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
