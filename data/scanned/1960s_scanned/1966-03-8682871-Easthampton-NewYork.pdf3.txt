Sighting 30 March 1966
and Mrs & Mrs *** sighting of UFO.
Report by Lt Campbell at Suffolk AFB was forwarded to Dayton 
on April 8 - 9 1966 (East Hampton, Long Island (N.Y.S))
writer for the New York Journal of America has requested
copies of the two peoples reports above. Before I can release the
reports to him I want to know if the witnesses want it released to
him. If the witnesses do not wish their names and reports released
to Mr. *** request a letter signed by the above witnesses be
sent to us stating so. If they can be released, request a letter
signed by the above witnesses be sent to us stating so. Request
Lt. Campbell prepared the letters and contact the witnesses at
once.

Inform Lt Campbell that there is some confusion inthe data. Message
indicates that 3 pller observed object on 30 March 66 plus observation
of 7 Apr 66. Your txt of 9 Apr 66 states under paragraph k
saw something 30 Mar 66 (03452) and reported it to us. After
checking with 62 DW Operations, we had no acft flying in that area
at this time: However, these eleven people heard jet acft. Also, Discussion
with Easthampton Patrolman Paul J. Green Wood ### . . . revealed
some facts
1. Spicers report of 30 Mar = What was it?
2. 7 Apr 66 combining two reports. Need separation.
3. Did 31 people see observation of 30 March or did 11 people
see observation of 7 Apr 66. Appears to be inconsistent apply to 30 Mar sighting
or 7 Apr 66
REPORTS SHOULD BE SENT TO PIO (INFO/UFO), W-P AFB, NOT AFSC ANDREWS AFB, (OVER)
