Dear Major
I saw a unidentify flying object Saturday Dec 14 1968 at 6:00. I have a guest- ionarc at home that comes out at my the air force. If you want me to send you the questionary I would be happy to. Would you please send me back a letter so you want me to send it to you or do you want me to send it to the police?
Your friend
