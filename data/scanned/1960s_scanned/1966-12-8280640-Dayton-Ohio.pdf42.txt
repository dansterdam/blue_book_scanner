Very well, that is what I saw. The object on my house was about the size of a medium balloon, white in color, moving around rather slowly & suddenly shot straight up & beyond at a remarkable speed & instantly disappeared & was thereafter non-existent (sightings merely reflective & not moving) * I was just reflecting & looking up at the sky & they came just reflecting & amidiate & on the whole at a point within a minute. But there was a cloud a little way of & steady, white motion ball on the side of it & in a few moments gone to an object about the size of a marble but fluttering & sharp & rather far away. Looked just like it was on the side of this white cloud. It was at 9:55 PM on the 6th, but plainly & quickly saw it was stationary & rapidly moved & then disappeared. I thought miteors or planes but it was still & any motion came from this white ball near the cloud so I concluded it was an object, not explained & to intelligent. Quiet. Respectfully, your.
