The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing a UFO sighting.

We got down to our camp at 12,000 feet at 0300 hours. We noticed two more of these objects in the clear side of the first one. They came to about 800 yards and five distance, Away more to the first object twice in the distance seconds to becom. They did when we turn to look at it away, motion object and we at once. These objects about 1600 p.m. and we still 12,000 observed.
Will you please tell me what you saw. If you need more information, I will be glad to furnish it.
Sincerely yours.
