The handwritten text reads:

On the evening of 12 Nov, 1961 at approximately 8:00 CST in Diboll, Texas, I observed from a house a bright light in the sky moving S.E. I looked overhead and noticed a slight reddish blue light at an angle of approx 70 degrees from the horizon in the NNW sky moving to the north. Occasionally it would stop and then proceed again. It was a large light and not a star like. I observed it moving steadily to the north. The light appeared to be constant with some flickering. It was higher than the trees across the street. I watched it for about 10 minutes before it disappeared. The light was not a plane or helicopter as I have observed them many times. The light appeared to be a UFO as I have never observed anything like it before.
