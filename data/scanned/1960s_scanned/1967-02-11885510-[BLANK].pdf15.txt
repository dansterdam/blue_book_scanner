SECTION III
POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING CONTACT

In view of the complete absence of concrete data on extraterrestrial civilizations the only possible formulation of the problem is this: Assuming that there are extraterrestrial civilizations, what would be the best way of getting in touch with them? This problem is twofold: (1) How can understandable signals be transmitted and (2) how can signals from outer space be detected and interpreted?

Radio signals from other civilizations, no matter how clear and strong, would have had no significance 50 years ago, since nobody on earth could intercept them, let alone interpret. According to modern astrophysics the development of stars is a continuous process and they certainly were not all created at the same time. If there are planets around them, and if there is life on these planets, and if there are civilizations, they must be in various stages of development. The extraterrestrial civilizations obviously must be in a similar or higher state of development than our own in order to make a contact possible.

On the earth, life has existed for something like two or three billion years. Written documents can be traced for some 6,000 years, while in contrast the use of radio for interstellar communication has only existed for around 100 years.
