UFO Over Milwaukee, Wis.
At 11:30 a.m., CST on August 3, 1962.
Mr. and Mrs. Mark Spruna of Milwaukee, Wis. were driving near the intersection of a busy highway when they saw a bright, round object in the sky. According to their report, the object appeared to be hovering, then suddenly accelerated and moved away from them at a high rate of speed, going higher than any known type of aircraft. They say the object had a "sunflower-shaped light" blinking in an uneven pattern as if it were a series of flashing lights. It then disappeared from sight, taking the same course it had taken.
The distance and altitude of the object was estimated by the witnesses to be about 3 miles and 4,000 feet, and it remained in sight for over a minute before suddenly accelerating and disappearing. The area was clear-shaped, and it had a color similar to bright copper or bronze. They also reported it had "lighted a trail as it went." No sound was heard.
According to their description, the object "was clearly unusual or strange" and they compared its appearance to that of a mushroom, with a dome-shaped top and a lower portion that seemed cylindrical or somewhat more elongated.
