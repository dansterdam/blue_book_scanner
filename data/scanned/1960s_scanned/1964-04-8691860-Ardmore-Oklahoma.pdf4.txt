SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Ardmore, Oklahoma, 9 Apr 64

TO: Hq USAF SAFOI PB (Mrs. [name redacted])
WASH D C 20330

1. Reference the attached letter from Miss [name redacted] describing a sighting object which she observed on 9 Apr 64. This letter is forwarded to your office for reply.

2. The information presented in Miss [name redacted]'s letter contained insufficient data for evaluation. It is suggested that an FTDM be furnished for a complete evaluation.

3. The object cannot be associated with any known type of weather phenomena. Sometimes the object had definite shape and construction. The duration was omitted as well as motion of the object. The duration indicates the probability of an aircraft and/or astronomical phenomena. Rollin's observing only the banner. Similar sketches have been submitted by witnesses observing this phenomena. She could not identify the object at the local airport and inquire as to various companies flying in the area. They would no doubt keep a record of all flying activities.
