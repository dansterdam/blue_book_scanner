DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WAS OBSERVED: At approximately 2300 hours on 8 Sept. 1960 a bright glowing object was observed hovering in the sky over the Hartford, Conn. area by several civilian witnesses. The object appeared to be circular in shape, approximately 50-60 feet in diameter, and was emitting a bright glow. It remained stationary for approximately 20-25 minutes before suddenly accelerating and departing at a high rate of speed. No sound was reported to be associated with the object.

CONCLUSIONS: The object was determined to be a genuine Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) based on the detailed descriptions provided by the civilian witnesses. The rapid acceleration and departure of the object at the end of the sighting are indicative of advanced aerospace vehicle capabilities beyond those of known conventional aircraft. The Air Force investigation into this incident is ongoing.
