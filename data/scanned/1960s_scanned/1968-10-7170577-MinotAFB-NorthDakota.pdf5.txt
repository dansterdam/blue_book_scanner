SUBJECT: 26 OCT 69 UFO SIGHTING FROM MINOT AFB, N.D.

At 11:35, 26 OCT 69, Sgt Jones received a call from Col. Wayant, HQ SAC, Offutt AFB, Nebr.
He wanted to know how we received the UFO report from Minot AFB. Sgt Jones informed him it was received by phone.
Col Wayant then asked what interest we took in a report like this and what we do when we receive the report. Sgt Jones told him it should have been given to the UFO Investigator but since it was passed into V-INT-DITURBO. Lt Pearson would get in-touch with the UFO Investigator at Minot. Col Wayant then said "the Investigator would handle it in accordance with AFR 80-17". Sgt Jones told him that we can't do anything until you receive their report". Sgt Jones said, that's right.
Col Wayant also wanted to know if there was any other reports for that period or time from that area. Sgt Jones told him to the best of his knowledge, he didn't think there was. Col Wayant said, who ever is handling the report to give him a call at 5556/1235, Sgt Jones informed that would be Lt Moreno.
