The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a project Blue Book document, which is a government investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text produced by the OCR system:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

North North West
(Horizontal)

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

ABOUT SIZE OF FULL MOON

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or a man's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

1/4 OR 1/3 MATCH HEAD

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

YES SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED 3 TIMES

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a motion picture of the object, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you observed.

1. AT FIRST APPEARS AS A LARGE BRIGHT SPOT
2. WHEN TURNED TO DISAPPEAR LOOKS LIKE A LARGE BUTTON.
