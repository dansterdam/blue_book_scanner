On the evening of May 8, 1967, my wife and I observed a strange, bright light in the sky over our home near the Sassafras River in Maryland. The light appeared to be in the shape of a somewhat elongated oval and was glowing with an intense white-yellowish color. It remained stationary in the sky for several minutes, and then suddenly shot off at a tremendous rate of speed, disappearing from view within seconds. Neither my wife nor I have ever seen anything quite like this object before, and we are at a loss to explain what it was. We are both convinced, however, that it was not a conventional aircraft or other known object. It appeared to be some sort of unidentified flying object. We would be most interested in learning if anyone else in the area reported a similar sighting on that evening.
