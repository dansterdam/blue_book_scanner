Dear Mr ******,

This replies to your recent correspondence concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).  Your sighting will be filed in our files.  However, a detailed scientific investigation is not conducted in each of these cases.

Without essential information such as flight characteristics, angular measurements, color, size or shape of the object, it is impossible to make any positive identification or analysis.  It is important that any description or observation be reported to the nearest Air Force headquarters so that a proper evaluation can be made.

Thank you for your interest in the Air Force UFO program.

Sincerely,

BARNETT E. YOUNG
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Division
