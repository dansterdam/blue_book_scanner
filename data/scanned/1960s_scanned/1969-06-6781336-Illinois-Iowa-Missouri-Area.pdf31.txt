The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document contains a form with various sections for the witness to fill out details about the UFO sighting, such as the location, direction, and duration of the phenomenon. At the bottom of the form, there is a handwritten note stating "DISAPPEARED AFTER ABOUT 3 SEC. AT "B" IN #7 SKETCH".
