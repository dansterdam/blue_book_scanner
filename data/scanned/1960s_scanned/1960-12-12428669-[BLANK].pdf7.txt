The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"Incidentally, there's one little phase of this where some of the UFO people say we do withhold information; they will go to an individual air base or someplace else and ask for given details on a specific case; and they're referred again to this big picture. Where we have the big picture, we know that ATIC is working on it out in Ohio -- Aero Space Technical Intelligence people -- we know that the air base is doing something, and we know what investigative group is on it. And they're referred up here mainly because we have the big picture.

DAVIS: Colonel, you're a man that does a lot of flying, and the airline pilots do a lot of flying, and these are competent people:

COLONEL TACKER: Absolutely!

DAVIS: --serious people, a lot of airline pilots have made statements in the past that they are convinced that they saw something that might have come from another planet, that was an object flying -- not a mirage, not a refraction of any kind, not a sky-hooked balloon. Now how do you answer these questions?

COLONEL TACKER: Well I I'm convinced that they saw something. Said, but I'm also convinced they didn't see a space ship as yet; many things enter into a pilot's way of life. Some fatigue, vertigo -- that type of thing. Many of them have seen lights which they couldn't identify for the moment, and a moment later they were identified as a light on the ground.

GORDON: Colonel Tacker, I'm sorry to interrupt, but our time is up. 

UP-: Thank you for providing a Washington viewpoint about flying saucers. Our guest on Washington Viewpoint tonight has been Colonel Lawrence J. Tacker, Chief of the Magazine and Book Branch of the United States Air Force Office of Information. This program originated tonight in Colonel Tacker's office in the Pentagon. This is Ann Corrick with Sid Davis.
