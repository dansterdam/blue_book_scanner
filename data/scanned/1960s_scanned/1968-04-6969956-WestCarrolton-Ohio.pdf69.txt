The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document, containing two main components:

1. A sketch/diagram showing the elevation of an observed object above the horizon, as well as its position relative to a compass. The sketch includes labeled angles and lines to indicate the object's position.

2. A request to the viewer to draw a picture showing the motion of the observed object or objects, indicating their path and any changes in direction during the course.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

90°                    A
    75°
      60°       25°
        30°
          15°
            0°           B

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
