The image contains a photograph depicting two illustrations of a "Tailored Expandable Structure". The illustrations show the structure in a compressed and expanded state. There is no human face visible in this image.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
TAILORED EXPANDABLE STRUCTURE
FIGURE 4
Dr. Ross: Leaving the airship for a moment and looking at one of the inflatable structures, Figure 4 shows the contraction and expansion of this type of structure. This is a major advantage over sheet metal structures, since we have the capability of making the structure as big as we want. This is an advantage over sheet metal structures, whether required or not. If we have a big load in one direction, we can put few yards into that direction, and this gives us the advantage of only putting the material where we want it. Can you visualize this? Also, it has the advantage of making these lightweight, that is what we talking about.
Also, every time you have a pressurized structure, where you have pressure in the center and carry all the material around it, should the internal pressure be reduced, the whole structure will tend to go down. The airship is a body of revolution of this type.
We attach the envelope to the bottom and distribute its load into the envelope by centenary attached to the top. Actually, you will find that we have to put pressures down on those areas to take the strain.
If we carried that over a wide span, you would find we could pull every bit out on the top and bottom and get the shape shown in the lower part of Figure 4, and have what you might consider a flat airship.
I also consider that you might take this and put an infinite number of these what you might take and go along as a pressurized structure that don't have to be limited to round structures, cylinders, or torus-type. This gives you great flexibility.
