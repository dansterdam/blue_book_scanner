IT IS SUGGESTED THAT IF SEVERAL SIGHTINGS HAVE BEEN MADE, USE SEPARATE SHEETS AND INDICATE DATE, TIME, LOCATION AND ANY OTHER PERTINENT DETAILS ON EACH SHEET. PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND PLACE A XXX AT ANY SUBSEQUENT POSITIONS OF THE PHENOMENON AS IT APPEARS TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
