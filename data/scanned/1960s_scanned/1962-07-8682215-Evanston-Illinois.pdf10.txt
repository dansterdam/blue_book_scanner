Three school newspaper boys, Mark Channing of Dalysmpic Street, Invarc ar gill N.Z. reported seeing 6 objects like polished silver discs about 75 feet in diameter, at an altitude of about 7,000 feet on 7 July 1962. Page 2 of the APRO Bulletin for May 1962. The boys reported the objects moving at a high rate of speed, moving northward across the sky, then suddenly accelerating and disappearing in less than 3 minutes and appeared to be moving at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
They estimated the objects to be moving at a speed of over 700 mph. The objects were observed for a total of 3 minutes and no sound was heard.
