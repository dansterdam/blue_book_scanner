Dear Mr. Goodwin:
It is very difficult for me to appreciate your telephone conversation regarding this incident on the evening of June 14, 1961. The times quoted, 3:00 and 3:05 A.M.
Direction low in the northeast over Maynard & vicinity heading north.
Duration, approximately 10 minutes.
This incident is to be treated as confidential as expressed to be desired by yourself on last evening as confidential for reasons of your own. I still have no additional information as to the nature or purpose of these cases which have been reported to me from one or two other sources, and I have made no effort as yet to pursue the matter further.
I trust the information herein will be of some interest to you.
