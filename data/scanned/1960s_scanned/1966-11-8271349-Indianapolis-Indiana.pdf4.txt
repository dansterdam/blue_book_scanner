At 12:30 a.m.
A telephone call was received reporting a strange light in the sky. The caller said the light appeared to be hovering and was a bright orange color. The light was seen by several other persons in the area. It was described as round or oval in shape.

The object was observed for about 3 to 5 minutes before it suddenly disappeared. There was no sound associated with the object.
