The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a hand-drawn sketch and diagrams. The sketch appears to be a geometric representation of an object moving across the sky, with instructions for the observer to mark various positions of the object. The diagrams include a compass rose and instructions for drawing the motion of the object. There is no text visible in the image that would require OCR processing.
