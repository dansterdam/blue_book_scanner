GARNET BAG HOT AIR BALLOONS

Hot Air Balloons, made out of garnet bags, usually appear as a red, orange, yellow or white light in the sky and may remain short as long as ten or fifteen minutes. If they stay longer, they may appear as two objects, one on top of the other. The bottom object is the heat source and is quite bright; the upper dull glowing object is the garnet bag. Usually the heat source is on a wood platform. When the object is aloft it may move in an erratic manner or a straight trajectory, depending on the wind. The balloons also flash and flickers as the wind blows the candles down, the platform may catch fire and pieces of burning debris to fall; however, they usually burn out before they hit the earth. Shortly after the sparks stop falling, the object disappears.
