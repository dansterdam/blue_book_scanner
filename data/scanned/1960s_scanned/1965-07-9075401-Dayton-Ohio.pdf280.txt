"No 9375401 
Dayton, Ohio 

The proprietor can see that he is upset and does not for a moment assume that his friend Joseph X. Masse is off his head. X. Masse says, "I did not want to say any any more, that nobody would believe him." 
So Masse, who has never been in any sort of trouble, and does not want to have any, tells what he has seen. It all starts with the following: 
"The call proprietor then rushes off to the field, and finds the marks, and this is how it all came about. 
It is at this point or shortly afterwards that the material that of journalism and espionage from the town of Belleville, Mass., becomes important. M. Masse confirms himself to his statements, firm evidence of truthfulness as he has a calm and objective manner far away. Whereas he used to sleep entirely normally before, he is now affected by an insomnia - he cannot sleep daily during the daydately after the incident. 
On the evening of July 14, he went to the spot with his 16-year-old daughter - he saw once again the famous landing legs of the craft. He explains that two of the six legs left their marks on the ground, namely from (a) and (b).
That morning, after the machine had remained muddy there throughout the night, M. Masse finds that there were still some little traces of the mud. In the evening he goes with his daughter and finds near the place where the craft had landed, two holes close to it - he finds that the mud had dried completely."
