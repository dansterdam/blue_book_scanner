Extracted text from the document:

Subsequent to their observation they had received numerous telephone calls from others in the area who had observed or heard the same existing object. The witnesses stated that the object was approximately 50 feet in diameter and described the sound as extremely loud. They received a call from a nurse at the Lansing County Jail who had also observed the object and a member of the township fire Marshall, had observed the object that same night.

The witnesses stated that the object was silent as a child a few months old and was the one that was awakened by the noise. The noise of the object did not disturb the sleeping child. Also, Mr. Moody observed that the object appeared in the sky and is attested to awaken at a bell, siren or telephone.

Following the interview with Mr. and Mrs. Moody and Bill Powers, they described to the home of Sgt. Moody and Sgt. Bill Powers at Grand Ledge, Michigan (about three miles east of Grand Ledge). During the interview, it was apparent that the sighting was not related to those objects with similar observed during the latter part of May. As they departed in their car, they turned on to a road leading to their home.
