AGAIN

Indiana.

March 18, 1961

To whom it concerns

Last night March 13, 1961 at around 7:55 p.m. EST a bright light object
was observed as it passed over the town of Osgood, Indiana. The object
low appeared to be about the size of a medium star and was observed for
about 3 minutes as it passed from the north to the south at a relatively
slow speed. It would disappear at intervals and then re-appear during its 
flight. I observed it until 9:00 r.m. and it was my own opinion as well
as others, that this was not an airplane, satellite, meteor or star as
it could be seen distinctly at intervals and was not noticeable like the
stars in the sky. I would appreciate an answer to this sighting.
