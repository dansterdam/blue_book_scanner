The text on the page is handwritten and appears to be a statement or report from an officer, Samuel T. Martin, Jr., 2nd Lt., USAF, Assistant Ground Training Officer, at an unspecified location.

OCR output:

Training Officer, BOI, Ext. 3106, Box 693, Whitefish, Missouri, 65301. Personal interview with the witnesses indicates that they observed 5 "lights" and that I found them very reliable and positive in relating their information. However, after considering all the information with our weather officer, LT Wade, I believe the "lights" were caused by weather conditions at that time which consisted of a front moving across the area causing radical changes in atmospheric temperature and visibility. There has been a plane sighted in the area soon after the "lights" were seen.

FOR THE COMMANDER
