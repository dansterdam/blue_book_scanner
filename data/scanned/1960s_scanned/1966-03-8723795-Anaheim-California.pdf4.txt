The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, with a form that has several questions and response fields. The text on the page is:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 2 Feb 1960

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
