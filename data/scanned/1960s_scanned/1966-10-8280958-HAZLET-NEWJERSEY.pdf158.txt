Patrolman had us come out to see object in southern sky. It seemed about 300 feet high. It was hovering, there and was about as large as an ordinary head light. It hovered about 3 minutes then suddenly darted to the east and curved around to the northwest at a tremendous speed. An instant flash of light seemed to come from the object as it passed. It was curved and passed out of sight. The whole sighting lasted for about 5 minutes.
