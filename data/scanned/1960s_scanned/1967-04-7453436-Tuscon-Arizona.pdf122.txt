Dear Sir:
The Air Force reached a conclusion pertaining to a sighting of a UFO near your location. This conclusion has been forwarded to the SAFOI to be specific Patterson, and you are being notified of this. Please note that this does not constitute a final conclusion on this case. I was unable to determine whether a representative of the Air Force could be called in to discuss the details concerning the conclusion on the UFO question. If you have any further questions, please notify me of the results. I am awaiting your reply.

Sincerely,
