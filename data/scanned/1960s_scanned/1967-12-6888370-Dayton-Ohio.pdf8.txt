it appeared as a very bright light, almost blinding, which changed dimensions and shape frequently. at first it looked small and round, then it elongated and became brighter, then contracted again. the brightness varied greatly, from very bright to dimmer. at no time was the object solid or well-defined. it appeared to be self-luminous rather than reflected light. there were no definite colors, but the light was white-bluish in tone. the movement was such that it did not resemble any known objects. there was no sound associated with the object.
