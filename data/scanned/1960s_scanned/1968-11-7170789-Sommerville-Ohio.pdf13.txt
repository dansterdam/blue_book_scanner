AFR 80-17(C)1) THE UFO APPEARED OVAL IN SHAPE. WHEN IT WAS MOVING, STRANGE LITTLE LIGHTS COULD BE SEEN AROUND THE EDGE OF IT. ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVER, IT SEEMED TO BE LUMINOUS OF SOME KIND.
(2) IT SEEMED TO BE HOVERING ABOUT 3 FEET FROM THE GROUND. THE WITNESS STATED IT SEEMED TO BE ROTATING DURING THE TIME HE OBSERVED IT.
(3) HE STATED THAT THERE WAS NO NOISE COMING FROM THE OBJECT. (EXTREMELY QUIET)
(4) HIS INITIAL REACTION WAS ONE OF EXCITEMENT, AND HE STATED HE WANTED TO APPROACH IT, BUT FELT SOMEHOW HELD BACK. HE'S NOT QUITE SURE WHY HE FELT THIS WAY.
(5) AND SO CLOSE HE WAS UVRR 85 IN THE CAR NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT WAS CRAZY TO SLOW DOWN AND LOOK AT IT.
THE ONLY THING THAT MADE ME LOOK, IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE IT WAS THERE.
