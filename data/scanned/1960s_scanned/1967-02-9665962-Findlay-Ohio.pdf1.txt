11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched 3 lights that were about the same size or aircraft lights. At times the three lights increased to about 5. The lights appeared to be red and appeared to be moving in various directions, but did not disappear. The witness had to stop looking because his yard lights were turned on and interfered with observation.
The observer did not report any azimuth or elevation for the lights. The data is not consistent with that of an aircraft observation; however, the case is being carried as insufficient data.
