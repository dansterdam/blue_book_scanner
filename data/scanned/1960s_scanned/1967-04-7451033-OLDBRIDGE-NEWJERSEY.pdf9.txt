OLDBRIDGE, NEW JERSEY
APRIL 7, 1967

On 7 April 1967, a USAF investigator was dispatched to Old Bridge, New Jersey, to investigate a reported UFO sighting. The witness, a resident of Old Bridge, reported observing a bright light in the sky on the evening of 7 April 1967. The witness claimed the object was much brighter than any star and was moving rapidly across the sky.

The USAF investigator interviewed the witness and examined the site of the sighting. No physical evidence was found, and the investigator was unable to identify the reported object. The case was therefore classified as "Unidentified."
