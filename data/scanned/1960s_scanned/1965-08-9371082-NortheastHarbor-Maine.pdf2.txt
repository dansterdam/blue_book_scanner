UFO Sighting
Reported by Nun
RINGWOOD, N. J., March 11
(UPI)â€”The Mother Superior at Mount St. Francis Convent in this Passaic County town told police she spotted an unidentified flying object that appeared "like a kite on fire" early Friday near the convent grounds.
Mother Superior Veronic said the "unusually bright" object was flying above the nearby abandoned Ringwood Mines. Police searched the area but could find nothing.
A rash of other unidentified flying objects were reported two months ago at the nearby Wanaque Reservoir
