WPAFB Probes Hoax In Saucer Case

A local spokesman for the Air Force stated that a hoax. has been indicated in a recent UFO sighting near Michigan City, Indiana. According to the report, the spokesman said that a "reasonably conclusive investigation" has indicated that the objects sighted were probably a hoax and not a genuine UFO. Quinatilla, project officer for the national Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, said that the hoax "could have been made up" and that the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that would indicate the presence of a genuine UFO. Quinatilla stated that a press conference will probably be held to discuss the findings of the investigation. The report mentions that several other recent UFO sightings in the area around Hillsdale, Michigan, under the direction of Dr. Hynek, have also been found to be hoaxes.
