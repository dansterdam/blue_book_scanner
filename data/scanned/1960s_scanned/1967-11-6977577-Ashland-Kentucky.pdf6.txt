The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANOTHER PLACE
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY!
STAND STILL AND RESPOND?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE YOUR DIRECTION?
FLASH OR BLINKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?

A round object going straight and mounting a student turn as others paper.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

It went out of sight.

B. DID IT DISAPPEAR MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING?
