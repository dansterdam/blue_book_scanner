The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which is an Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Recommendations:
1. Instructions be issued to investigating Air Force personnel to take additional data. The distortion of the true orientation of the two shapes would have been available to show them to be located in other than a mere coincidence.
2. It is suggested that an appointed member of the Civil Perceptions or Radio Section, Technical Branch, be called upon every time a UFO sighting, A/P/CG/OTH, has suggested that this course could be employed. Such appointment should be authorised in writing in a formal manner: a more accurate estimated weight acting on the disturbance can be made in the investigation of future reported cases.
3. It is mandatory that a more accurate layout of the photograph. Pieces of string tied to photograph can serve as valuable reference lines. At the minimum, a straight line should be drawn bisecting the photograph through the center. The reason for this line is that an accurate diagram can be reconstructed to show the angle of approach and relative altitude of the UFO, depending on the particular case, no record whatever was made of the angular measurement, which handicap in the analysis of the evidence.
