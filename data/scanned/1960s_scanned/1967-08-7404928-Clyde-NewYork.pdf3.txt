On July 23, 1967 at about 8:15 pm, my wife and I were sitting in the backyard of our home on Wright Road, Clyde, New York, watching the sky as we often do. We noticed a bright red light in the northwest which appeared to be moving. The light appeared to be round like a basketball at arm's length and quite brilliant. It seemed to be about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. After watching it for a few minutes it appeared to stop or hover for a few seconds and then continued on its course. It seemed to get smaller as it moved away to the northwest. It had no blinking lights and made no sound that we could hear. It was visible for approximately 5 to 10 minutes. It was a very clear and starlit night and the object appeared to be at a high altitude. After it left our sight, we went indoors and I called the Williamson Air Force Base, about 15 miles north of us, to report the sighting. I was told by the person I spoke with that they had received no other reports of any unusual aerial activity in our area that evening. I have been a very interested sky-watcher for many years and this was the most unusual and unexplainable object I have ever observed. I am at a loss to identify it as anything manmade or of natural origin.
