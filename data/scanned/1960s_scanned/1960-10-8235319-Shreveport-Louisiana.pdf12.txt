HARVEST HOUSE
THIS REPORT CONCERNS A VISIBILITY ITEM THAT OCCURED ON 6 MAY 1960 NEAR SHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED BY SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE WESTERN SKY - THEY CALLED IT A "FLYING SAUCER" BECAUSE IT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR OR OVAL SHAPED AND SILVERY IN COLOR, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE AUTOMOBILE.

IT SUDDENLY BEGAN MOVING ACROSS THE SKY AT A RAPID RATE OF SPEED AND CHANGED DIRECTION SEVERAL TIMES, THEN SHOT STRAIGHT UP OUT OF SIGHT. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 TO 20 MINUTES. IT APPEARED TO BE VERY HIGH UP AND VERY BRIGHT, ALMOST METALLIC IN APPEARANCE. THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IT APPEARED TO BE PERFECTLY ROUND AND QUITE LARGE COMPARED TO KNOWN AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA.

THE OBJECT WAS REPORTEDLY SIGHTED BY SEVERAL INDEPENDENT WITNESSES IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME. IT DOES NOT SEEM TO MATCH ANY KNOWN NATURAL PHENOMENON OR ESTABLISHED AIRCRAFT. THE WITNESSES APPEAR TO BE SINCERE AND RELIABLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO REASON TO FABRICATE SUCH A STORY.
