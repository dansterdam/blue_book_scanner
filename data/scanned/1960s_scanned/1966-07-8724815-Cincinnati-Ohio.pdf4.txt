The image contains a page from an old UFO report document, but it does not contain any photographs. The page appears to be a form or questionnaire filled out by an observer reporting a UFO sighting.

Here is the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes - No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: Passed behind trees.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes - No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound: None. b. Color: White - yellowish.
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a matchstick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how many of the objects covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would it have covered? Angular size unknown.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the objects that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
