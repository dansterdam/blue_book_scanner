The image contains three illustrations. The first illustration is a sketch depicting a curved path showing how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second illustration shows a larger sketch of the object's position when the observer first saw it, and a smaller sketch of the object's position at a later time. The third illustration shows a person standing on a road, looking up at something in the sky.

In the following text, I will act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
