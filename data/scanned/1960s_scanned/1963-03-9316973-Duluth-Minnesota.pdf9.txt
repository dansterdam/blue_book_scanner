THE ABOVE PHOTO (not related to the Moore story, which begins on Page 10), was taken at about 2:30 P.M. on the afternoon of March 12th, 1963. The witness was a correspondent of SAUCER NEWS, who was sitting on the back porch of his home in Albany, New York, when he noticed a strange object in the sky. The object was hovering for several seconds, then suddenly shot upward at a steep angle and disappeared. The witness claims he had no time to get his camera to photograph the object, but he was able to sketch several pictures of it as it appeared in the sky. No further details are available as yet.
