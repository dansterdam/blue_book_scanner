Then as far as the actual observation, you couldn't determine a distinct shape?
Not myself. How I took the shape from what the pilot was talking to me about.
From your own observation, could you determine any color?
Well, with the sun shining on it, it looked silver. The pilot described it from the beginning very reflective and accelerating rapidly to the right or east; and accelerating.
From your own observation, this silver color--was it shimmering as if it were going back and forth or?
It looked solid to me. He said it seemed to tilt. And I think maybe the sun would hit it, it would--it looked solid color to me. It didn't seem to be shimmering any.
There's your description of it. Is there any features such as you would find on a manned aircraft?
From my observation, there were no features that I could see at all. There was no tail section, no wings. It was pencil shaped, according to his description. There was no tail section.
What would you say the angle or altitude would be?
Well, I would say that at first, it was 5,000--first I would say at that distance it would be hard to say exactly, but it would be about--over this well, maybe 5,000 I'd say that when he pulled up to within 3-1/2 miles of it he was at 6,000 I would verify that when he.
And you say it appeared to be about 30 miles away?
Right.
Which direction would that be?
South. I was looking out the window when I saw it, talking on the phone, and at the same time trying to talk on the phone to him.
And it would be due South of the Central Aviation?
Right.
With regard to the flight path of the object--did you see it move at any time?
I saw it in this one position; the first time it was low on the horizon and the second time it was to the flight and higher--I'd say maybe 6-10,000 ft variation.
How much time would there have been between the two sightings?
