ON 4 AUGUST AT 12320Z (APPROXIMATELY) THE CREW OF A TAC C-130 AIRCRAFT REPORTED THAT THEY HAD OBSERVED AN OBJECT IN THE AIR WHILE PRACTICING INSTRUMENT APPROACH TO KAHULUI AIRPORT, MAUI, HAWAIIAN ISLANDS AT 2290. LOCATION OF THE AIRCRAFT WAS 125 W TO 128 W MILES OFFSHORE.

(1) OCEAN STATION NOVEMBER SIGHTED THE SAME OB-JECT AND REPORTED THAT IT LIFTED UP THE WHOLE SKY AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD.

(2) INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY AN ALIAS CASSEGRAINIAN TELESCOPE (A TYPE USED IN MILITARY BY COMMAND FIGHTER FIRE CONTROL OPTICS). THE FLASH FROM FUEL STILL LEFT IN THE BOOSTER ON SEPARATION RESEMBLED THAT OF THE MAIN FIRING WAS 13 MINUTES LONGER THAN THE SIGHTING REPORTED BY THE AIRCRAFT. HOW-EVER, THE INTERVENING REPORTS BY THE AIRCRAFT ON-STRUCTION OF THE OBJECT, INCLUDING THAT THE OBJECT SEEMED TO INCREASE IN SIZE, IS IN FACT ONE AND THE SAME.

ON 5 AUGUST AT 14572, REPORTED A ROCKET FIRING FROM THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN. THE OBJECT CLIMBED RAPIDLY AND FLEW INTO THE CLOUDS ON HEADING 0495. ONE AIRCRAFT ALSO REPORTED A SIGHTING OF THREE LIGHTS WHICH TRAVELED AT GREAT SPEED ACROSS THE LAUNCH AREA.

(1) A QUERY TO CINCPACFLT OPS PLOT REVEALED THAT THE SIGHTING WAS PROBABLY DUE TO A NAVY OPERATION BEING CONDUCTED IN THAT AREA AT THAT TIME.

ALSO ON 5 AUGUST AT 0500Z, A TEENAGER REPORTED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY. SINCE NO OTHER DETAILS WERE AVAILABLE AND NO CONCLUSION COULD BE DRAWN, THE SIGHTING WAS RULED NON-SIGNIFICANT AND NO INVESTIGATION WAS MADE.
