Dear Mr. Brown:

We have for some time felt remiss in not writing to you and thanking you for your interest and efforts on behalf of the case of the UFO sighting near Sherman, Texas in the summer of 1965.

It was a very unusual incident and we feel that with your assistance, we were able to obtain a reasonably complete account of what occurred. As you know, the case received a great deal of publicity at the time and we have had numerous inquiries about it since then.

I did mention to you at the time that we would be interested in obtaining any additional information you might be able to provide, particularly with respect to any official Air Force investigation or evaluation of the incident. If you have any such information, we would be most grateful if you could forward it to us.

We have filed this case in our permanent records and consider it one of the more puzzling and interesting UFO reports that has come to our attention.

Again, our sincere thanks for your cooperation in this matter. We appreciate your interest and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
