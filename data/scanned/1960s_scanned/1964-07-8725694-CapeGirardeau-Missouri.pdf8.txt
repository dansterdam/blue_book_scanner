The witness, Mr. James Duesler, has stated that he saw a circular, silvery object with lights hovering over a wooded area near his home. Mr. Duesler also reports that the object eventually descended into the trees and disappeared from sight. 

We would appreciate receiving any information you may have concerning this incident. Please let us know if you require any additional details.

Sincerely yours,
