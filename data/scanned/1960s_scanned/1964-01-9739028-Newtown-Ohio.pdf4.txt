The image contains a sketch illustrating the path and motion of a UFO or unidentified object. The sketch includes directional arrows and a compass rose. There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an x on the curve where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Indicate how the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the start of the path, a "B" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and an arrow to show the direction they moved.
