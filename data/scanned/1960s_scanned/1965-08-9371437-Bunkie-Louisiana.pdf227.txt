The text found in the document is as follows:

THE OBJECTS WERE FIRST OBSERVED AS BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE SKY. THEY MOVED IN AN ERRATIC MANNER, SOMETIMES REMAINING STATIONARY AND THEN ACCELERATING RAPIDLY, MAKING SHARP RIGHT ANGLE TURNS. THEN THEY WOULD DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR IN ANOTHER PART OF THE SKY. SEVERAL PEOPLE OBSERVED THESE OBJECTS AND REPORTED THEM TO THE LOCAL POLICE AND THE AIR FORCE BASE AT ALEXANDRIA, LOUISIANA. A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE AIR FORCE BASE WAS SENT TO INVESTIGATE. HE TALKED TO SEVERAL WITNESSES AND OBTAINED WRITTEN STATEMENTS FROM THEM. HIS INVESTIGATION REVEALED NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THE OBJECTS WERE ANYTHING MORE THAN NORMAL AIRBORNE OBJECTS. HE STATED IN HIS REPORT THAT IT WAS HIS OPINION THE OBJECTS WERE PROBABLY AIRCRAFT, SATELLITES, OR OTHER ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENA. HIS REPORT HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO HEADQUARTERS OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK FOR EVALUATION.
