The image appears to show a black and white photograph of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified flying object in the sky. The object is somewhat blurry and indistinct, but it appears to be disc-shaped and hovering above the landscape.

CASE 2 MILLEDGEVILLE, GEORGIA - 12 OCTOBER 1967
On 12 October 1967, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Mr. and Mrs. Carl Hickman were traveling on Georgia Highway 22, about 8 miles west of Milledgeville, Georgia, when they observed a bright light in the sky. The light descended rapidly and passed over their automobile at an estimated altitude of 400-500 feet. The object appeared to be round in shape, with a fixed red light on the top and a pulsating white light on the bottom. It was estimated to be about 30-40 feet in diameter. The object hovered for approximately 2 minutes, then accelerated to a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view. Mr. Hickman immediately stopped his automobile and he and his wife observed the object for about 2 minutes before it departed. They described the object as making no sound and having no visible means of propulsion.
