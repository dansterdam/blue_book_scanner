The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It consists of a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a series of questions and answer fields related to the sighting of an unidentified object.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
The image shows a hand-drawn oval shape, representing the motion of the unidentified object.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
The answer field contains the response: "Current object"

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The answer field contains the response: "About one inch"

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The answer field contains the response: "NO"

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
The answer field contains the response: "Wing lights of an ATC"
