The text in the document is as follows:

It was about 2:30 P.M. at the time and there was a very bright flash of light in the sky. I was in the yard of my home at the time. The flash was extremely bright and intense, and it seemed to fill the whole sky. I noticed that the birds in the trees became very agitated and started flying around in a circle. After the bright flash of light, I noticed a small white object moving across the sky at a very high rate of speed. It appeared to be circular in shape and was traveling in a straight line. The object was only visible for 3 or 4 seconds before it disappeared from sight. I have never seen anything like it before.
