The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned page from what appears to be a newspaper or magazine called "The Aduorate" dated March 17, 1965. The page contains text that appears to be a letter from an individual named Alan Pentz, who is described as the "Greenville Advocate" from Greenville, Ohio.

Transcription of the text:

Dear Majors:

The enclosed clipping will show you how we handled the information on the "Florida" sighting. We would appreciate knowing the outcome of the paper and symbol studies, but realize, of course, that this is a private matter. We know that these reports are being packed away in the paper basement, so if there is any way our report can be held open for further study, we would appreciate knowing this at the earliest convenience, or if they can't figure out what it is perhaps some additional questioning along the same lines could be made.

We appreciate the assistance you people give us in reporting out the final answers. 

Cordially,
Alan Pentz
Greenville Advocate
Greenville, Ohio
