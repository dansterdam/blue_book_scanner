The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be a questionnaire or form that the observer would have filled out to describe their UFO sighting.

The text on the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It travelled straight through with a smooth motion and then suddenly disappeared with no trail or smoke at all.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes *** Don't Know. 
IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes *** Don't Know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - All I heard was the object, I heard no sound.
b. Color - Silvery white.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object could have been covered by the match head?
Match Head Cover (Blank)

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically indicate trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
