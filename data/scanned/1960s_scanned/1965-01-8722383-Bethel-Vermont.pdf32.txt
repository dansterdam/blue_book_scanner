FRIDAY, MAY 13, 1965
BETHEL, VERMONT

3 UFOS WENT FLYING BY

On May 6, 1965, Herman Holbrook was suddenly awakened at 3:00 a.m. by a noise. Looking out the window, he saw 3 unidentified flying objects (UFOs) moving rapidly through the sky. They were large, round objects with bright lights and were traveling at a very high rate of speed. He estimated they were about 1,000 feet above the ground. The objects were moving very rapidly and he was able to observe them for only a brief period of time as they passed out of sight. He estimated their speed at about 500 mph.
On the following Monday between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m., Mr. Holbrook and a neighbor, Meryl Welch, were having a conversation and observed another UFO in the sky. This object was somewhat smaller than the previous ones and also had bright lights. It traveled at a very high rate of speed across the sky in a southeasterly direction and soon passed out of sight.
Mr. Holbrook reported these sightings to the Bethel Police Department and also notified the local newspaper, the Bethel Courier.
