Dear Sir:

In my capacity as Scientific Consultant to the Air Forces' Project Blue Book, I am trying to get more details on the April 24, 1964 sighting at Socorro, New Mexico, made by Lt. Zamora.

I would very much appreciate your help in obtaining the name and address of the individual referred to in the enclosed copy of Mr. Hisherger's letter who might also have witnessed this sighting.

I wish to assure you that my interest in this matter is entirely professional and under no circumstances do I use this material for publicity purposes or for any other reason than to solve this puzzling phenomenon of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
