SECT 84 1947

Dear Sir,

This will reply to your letter of October 9, 1967, to Major Richard F. Hinkle, Headquarters Air Force Liaison. 

We are sorry that you believe there are discrepancies in the handling of your photographic - (negatives?) you might be interested in sending the original negative(s) to Dr. Edward U. Condon, CUFOS Institute, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80302, for photographic analysis. This is a part of their investigation of unidentified flying objects and is searching for a photographic or a home film UFO.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STERNER
