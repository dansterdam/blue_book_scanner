The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document discussing the details of a "Motion Picture" that was apparently reviewed or analyzed.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"Memorandum to: Brigadier General Arthur C. Adkins
Commanding Officer, USAF Project "Blue Book"
Subject: Motion Picture - Unidentified Object

1. Reference is made to memorandum dated 15 August 1955, which mentioned the possible examination of a "Motion Picture" of an unidentified object.

2. Approximately 6 months ago, a leading commercial airline pilot who had reported a sighting of an unidentified object which was confirmed by other pilots, told me he had a color motion picture of the object. He stated he would make the film available to the Air Force for examination. He has now informed me that for personal reasons he does not wish to have the film examined at this time. He feels that the release of such an unusual type of film might jeopardize his position with the airline. This will unfortunately delay any comprehensive study which might have been made of the film.

3. It appears that from time to time reports are received concerning motion pictures or other photographic evidence of unidentified aerial objects. Procedures for the evaluation and study of such materials should be considered, in the event further offerings are made.

4. A UFFO-type sighting was described by Mid-Continent Airlines pilot, high visibility, as reported to O.F. Bartron."
