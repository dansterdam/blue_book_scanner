INTERVIEW WITH ---- - - SON OF THE OWNER OF THE d'CALL RANCH JUST NORTH OF THE GRAVEL PIT AREA

(Mr. --- was chosen for an interview because the gravel pit area is partially visible from the farm and because a number of horses are kept adjacent to the area of the sighting. It was during this interview that I learned that Mr. --- was a friend of Mr. ---)

Mr. --- reported that damage had been done to the side of his barn during the night or early morning periods in which the sighting occurred.

He stated that only one horse, the most gentle on the ranch, could have done the damage. He also reported that he had not heard any disturbances during the times of the sighting or observed any injuries to the horse on the morning following the incident.

Mr. --- frequently visits the gravel pit to practice shooting. He reported seeing ice on the pond during a visit of February 17. A second visit on February 17 revealed that the ice was breaking up. Estimated thickness of the ice on February 17 was 1.5 inches. He mentioned that the gravel pit was a cold spot on the island, but that it was warm and melting on the 17th and for the next two days, leaving little chance for the ice to last.

INTERVIEWER'S COMMENT

Mr. --- gave the impression of accuracy in his statements. He did not jump to the conclusion that the horse had damaged the barn, because he had not heard a disturbance or observed any injury to the horse. He stated that he thought it was "unlikely" that the horse had done the damage.
