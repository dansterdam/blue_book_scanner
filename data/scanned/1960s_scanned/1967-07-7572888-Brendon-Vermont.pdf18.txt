The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten description of a UFO sighting. The text describes four similar objects that "appeared suddenly and disappeared in the distance." It notes that the objects were not conventional aircraft or heavenly bodies, but were "silently controlled." The text also provides details about the sighting, such as the time it occurred, the course the objects took, and that they landed in approximately the same spot. No humans are identified in the image.

Here is the text transcribed from the image:

"It then spel up suddenly and disappeared in the distance. It was a clear night and stars were visible. This was not a star, meteorite, etc.

All these sightings have much in common:

All four were similar on the same objects.

All four were silent and did not resemble conventional aircraft or heavenly bodies, but did seem to be intelligently controlled. 

With the exception of their last sightings, all followed approximately the same course at approximately the same speed, and all landed in approximately the same spot.

The last sighting was following the opposite course of the others (west veering northwest) and appeared to be either smaller or farther away.

All were sighted between 10:15 P.M. and 11:15 P.M."
