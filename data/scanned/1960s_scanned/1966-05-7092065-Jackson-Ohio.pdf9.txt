Dear Sir,
On that date around 6:45 I was outside and noticed a peculiar object in the sky. It was round and appeared to rotate or spin. It was also making a slight humming noise. The object was about the size of a large airplane and was about 1000 feet in the air. It remained in the same position for around 5 minutes before disappearing suddenly. I have no explanation for what I saw. Please let me know if you need any additional information.
Sincerely,
[Redacted], Ohio
