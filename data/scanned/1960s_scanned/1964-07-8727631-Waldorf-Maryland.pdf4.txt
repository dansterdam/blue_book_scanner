There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It seemed to just fade away as it disappeared, there were no signs of any trail left behind.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One):   Yes    No    Don't know.    If you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes    No    Don't know.    If you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound None Whatsoever
b. Color White and seemed to be glowing

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, what would the result have been?
I did not do the match stick experiment, but the object seemed to be quite small and round, maybe 2-3 inches in diameter.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please try to show the direction the object was moving.
[The hand-drawn sketch shows a roughly circular or elliptical shape representing the UFO, along with some lines and shapes that appear to depict movement or trails.]
