The text in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 15 OCT 1956

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The object seemed to move and hover after I lost sight of it near the ground. It was very bright and clear.
