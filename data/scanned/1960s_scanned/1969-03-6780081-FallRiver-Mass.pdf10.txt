IF THIS FIGHTING WAS AT TWILIGHT OR NIGHT, WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE STARS AND MOON?

NO UNUSUAL

WHAT COULD YOU SEE OF THE OBJECT(S) IN DAYLIGHT, WHAT PART WAS VISIBLE? [X] THE ENTIRE OBJECT [ ] PART OF THE OBJECT

THE ENTIRE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE

IF THE OBJECT WAS SEEN IN DAYLIGHT, WAS THE SUN VISIBLE? [ ] YES [X] NO. IF YES, WHERE WAS THE SUN'S POSITION ACCORDING TO THE OBJECT?

Reported kindly, there appeared to be a brightly gleaming metallic object, spherical to round in shape, bright silver or white in color, appearing to be in flight during daylight, just below an overcast sky. The object maneuvered at various angles, swiftly and smoothly. In appearance it seemed about the size of a car or perhaps smaller, but it was difficult to judge its exact size and distance as it continued its flight. There was no trail or exhaust visible, and it did not seem to be powered by any conventional means. It was in sight for several minutes before disappearing quickly, almost as if it had burst into the clouds or beyond. The observer was unable to determine the exact flight path or final destination of the object but it was observed to be in powered, controlled flight.
