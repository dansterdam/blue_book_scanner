The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report with handwritten text.

Text output from the image:

This was not in my previous report
It was added later on and no pictures were taken.
The only pictures taken were of the plane and the landing
gear of the aircraft.
This was not a meteorite and could not have been a
weather balloon or any other type of aircraft.
It did not resemble any known type of aircraft.
T.C.C. as not in my first report
it was added later on and no pictures were taken.
