The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an official U.S. Air Force document with a questionnaire about observations of an unidentified object.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear, while you were watching it? If so, how?
IT WENT VERY HIGH UP IN THE SKY AND DIRECTLY UNDER ANOTHER BALL 
OF LIGHT AND JUST WENT OUT OF SIGHT.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One):     Yes     No     Don't know.  
If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following about the object:
a. Sound: 
NO SOUND AT ALL

b. Color:
WITE BALL SHOT

18. We want to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw or picture what you saw. Show the shape of the object or objects, their size, and include in your sketch any details of the object that may help identify what it was. Please sketch the direction the object was moving, if it appeared to be moving.
