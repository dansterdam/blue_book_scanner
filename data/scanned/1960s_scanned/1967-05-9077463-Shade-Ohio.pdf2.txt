The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page describes a witness report, including questions about the sighting and personal information about the witness. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before. If so give date or dates and location.
Mr. Sharpie, David Crank Mr. Sharp, Shirley Crank L--------, in Ashland
31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One)   Yes   No
31.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One)   Yes   No
31.2 Please list their names and addresses:

NAME  
ADDRESS Street  City  State 
TELEPHONE NUMBER   AGE 19  SEX FEMALE
Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent.
I HAVE HAD SOME PECULIAR AND INTERESTING EXPERIENCES INVOLVING STRANGE CLOUDS WITH LIGHTS AND COLORS, WHICH COULD BE CONNECTED WITH THIS SIGHTING. ONE OCCASION WAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO NEAR ASHLAND OHIO AROUND 8:30 PM. THERE WERE LIGHTS AND COLORS IN THE SKY THAT WERE UNUSUAL.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
I WAITED FOR A WHILE TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAD REPORTED ANYTHING BEFORE I DID. I FINALLY CALLED THE ASHLAND COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE ABOUT 3 DAYS LATER.
