Dear Sir:

As I realize how busy you must be, but kindly take my letter into consideration!

I and the rest of my family had just arrived home and were trying to make up the sidewalk to our house when an object of about the size of the 2nd star of the Big Dipper attracted our attention. It did not make any noise and the color was a definite orange color and traveled in a straight line downward for about 200 and then suddenly disappeared.

The duration of time that I saw it was about 60 seconds. It appeared it about 25 degrees west of the horizon & the lower end of the dip-per. The time was about 6:50. I saw this from there Janesville, Wisconsin where I was living. I saw it disappear and was about 5 or 6 minutes from the time I first saw it until the end of the sighting. This time was from 6:50 until about 6:55 or 6:56.

I swear with the utmost sincerity that the above is the truth.

Yours sincerely,
