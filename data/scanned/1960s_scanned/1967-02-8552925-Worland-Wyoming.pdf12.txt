Hill Air Force Base, Utah:

Dear Major:

After reading the article in the Worland, Wyoming newspaper. I decided it best to clarify the report. As you know, the Western UFO Command recently had an interesting encounter and it seems I have been chosen to help. On the night of the 11th, they were quite successful. Our daughter, who is an enthusiastic member, was on the scene. The light was overpowering, but as it moved away the earth was enveloping in a bluish mist. On the following morning C2 people called at our house, when the encounter Mother said Dad had for their guests. We appreciate your thoughts and he asked me to tell you this saves you further trouble.

Sincerely,
