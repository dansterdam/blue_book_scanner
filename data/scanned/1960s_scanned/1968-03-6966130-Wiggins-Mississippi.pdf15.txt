Text from the document:

Dear Sir:

There is a lot of talk about the Air Force doing away with civilian reporting of UFO's. This is not true - at least not completely true. The Air Force wants the public to continue reporting UFO's and will continue to investigate all reports. Briefly, here is what the new UFO reporting procedures will be:

1. All UFO reports will be handled through local law enforcement agencies. When a citizen observes a UFO, he should report it to the local police. The police will then notify the nearest Air Force base, which will dispatch an investigator to interview the witness. This will save the Air Force a lot of time and effort in tracking down witnesses.

2. The name and address of the witness will be kept confidential upon request. This should encourage more people to report UFO sightings without fear of publicity or ridicule.

3. There will be no more public Project Blue Book reports. All UFO data will be classified as "confidential" and handled on a need-to-know basis within the Air Force and other government agencies. Public release of this data will be very limited.

So, in summary, the Air Force wants the public to continue reporting UFO observations, but through a new procedure utilizing local law enforcement. This should result in more complete investigations and better data for analysis.
