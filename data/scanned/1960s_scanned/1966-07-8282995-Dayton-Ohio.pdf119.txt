The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains a series of questions about the observer's experience with a UFO sighting, including whether the object disappeared, moved behind something, or moved in front of something. The last question asks the observer to draw a picture showing the shape of the object and any details observed, such as wings, protrusions, and exhaust trails or vapor trails. The filename suggests this is page 119 from the document "1966-07-8282995-Dayton-Ohio.pdf".

"14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?  

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?  
(Circle One):     Yes    No     Don't Know.  
If you answered YES, then tell what.  

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?   
(Circle One):     Yes    No    Don't Know.  
If you answered YES, then tell what.  

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please do not aside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving."
