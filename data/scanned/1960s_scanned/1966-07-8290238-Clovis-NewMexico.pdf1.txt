The brief summary and analysis states that the observer watched a clear shaped object with its long axis parallel to the ground flying toward the NW. The altitude was about that of a high flying aircraft. The object followed a course from SE to the NW. The object had the color of red-white flames, and an inconsistent exhaust about five times the length of the object itself. The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation.
