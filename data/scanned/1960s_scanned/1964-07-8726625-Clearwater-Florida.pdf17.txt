Capt, A. H. Hanger, observer
Visual observations of satellite-like object
Ocala, Florida
6 June 1964

My attention was drawn to a strange object in the sky on the night of 6 June 1964. It was approximately 830 pm local time. The object seemed to be drifting or moving slowly. It appeared to be a grayish or whitish color and very bright. At one point, it appeared to become slightly elongated in shape. After a few minutes, it faded and disappeared. I would estimate its total flight time to be approximately 10 minutes. I did attempt to get a camera but was not able to obtain any photographs of the object before it faded from view.
