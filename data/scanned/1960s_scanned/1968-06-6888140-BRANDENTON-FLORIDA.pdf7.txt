Dear Sir:

On May 23, 1968 I observed something very unusual. I was outside may home at about 8:00 in the evening observing the constellations when I noticed a very bright light in the southwestern sky. At first I thought it might be a satellite, but the light was brighter than any I had ever seen from a satellite. It seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly in an east to west direction. After observing it for several minutes, I called my wife to come and look at it. She agreed that it was very unusual and we watched it for about 15 minutes. During this time, the light seemed to be getting closer and appearing to change in shape. At one point it appeared to be shaped like a football. Then it began to fade and finally disappeared from sight. We were both amazed at what we had seen and could not think of any logical explanation for it. The whole incident left us very puzzled. Often the would-be occurrence of such events makes me wonder if there is indeed more to the universe than meets the eye. It may be a mistake to discuss it further, but I felt I should pass on my observation from the start, if it is of any interest.
