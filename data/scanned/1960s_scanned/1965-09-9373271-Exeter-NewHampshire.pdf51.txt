There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text found in the document is as follows:

AS BEFORE. The lights moved out across the field at an estimated speed of 100 feet and finally disappeared in the distance at the same altitude. The lights were always at about 450 angle. When the object and the lower lights were abreast of the observers, the lower lights were always observed of the others... Local time of the observation was approximately two hours. 

COMMENTS
The general description of flashing lights is consistent with reports of aircraft, refuelling operations or low level photographic air force operations in the area. An investigation was made as to the possibility of aircraft in the area at the time of the observation. The Air Force "Big blasts" was indicated in the New England area at aircraft (from Pease AFB) were between 22:34 and 23:33 local time. The description does not fit normal aircraft operations although several reports world wide have been received of similar objects and reports, presumed to be aircraft, were evaluated, was the preliminary impression of the investigator.

The preliminary impression was that the lights were the cause of the sightings. These aircraft were in the traffic pattern at Pease AFB between 22:34 and 23:33, which does not correspond to the time observation. Since no aircraft can be identified as the Air Force, the case is listed as unidentified by the Air Force.
