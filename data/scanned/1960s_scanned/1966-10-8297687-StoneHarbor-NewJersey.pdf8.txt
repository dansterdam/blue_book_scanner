Gentlemen:
I am writing you a letter to you that my friend and I saw a UFO. We have been hesitating to write to you for fear we will be ridiculed because I am ridiculed all day by my classmates. They think I am crazy believing in UFOs. I have read four flying saucer paperbacks. They are as follows: Anderson's Observation, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, Flying Saucers, and The Starting Evidence of the Invasion from Outer Space, and Flying Saucers Serious 13.

I think that The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects was the most interesting. I believe the UFO almost certainly exist. I hope they will find the answer in this decade, and I hope the answer is that there are space crafts from other world beside ours.
