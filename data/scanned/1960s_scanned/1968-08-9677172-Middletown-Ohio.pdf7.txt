There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. This seems to be a textual document from Project Blue Book, specifically a memo for the record regarding a UFO sighting on August 7, 1963 in Canada, as reported by Dr. Hynek.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: UFO Sighting, 7 Aug 63, Canada, by Dr Hynek

Dr J Allen Hynek called the Aerial Phenomena Office on 7 Aug 63 at 1300 hrs, EDT, to inform them that he saw a funny thing. Saw a jet chasing something at 11pm due North, a very bright ball of light, brighter than Venus. 10 deg behind the unknown object was a jet. "We don't think we could hear any sound from the bright object but we did hear noise from the jet." Could see the wing tip lights from the jet but only one big light from the object. Plane probably from Kincheloe, so Dr Hynek thought. Dr Hynek said he saw the object for presumably two minutes, but it may have been three. Dr Hynek said he was going to call Kincheloe and ask for information and would appreciate our office doing so. Dr Hynek will call/tomorrow morning.

At 1400 hours got through to Lt Col Quintanilla who was TDY in Wash, D.C. We will not contact Kincheloe to obtain the data. Additional information to obtain from Dr Hynek is: Are or sky covered, Did it pass directly overhead? Did Dr Hynek get any photographs? He always carries a camera. What was Dr Hynek's estimation of the weather? Was it clear?
