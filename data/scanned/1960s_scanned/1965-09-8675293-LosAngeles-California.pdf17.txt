MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: UFO, 9 September 1965
SIGHTING "A"

TIME AND PLACE: Between 2140 and 2145/- 9 Sept 65, Los Angeles, California

REPORTED BY: K.R.C., social worker, Bureau of Public Assistance, Los Angeles County, California

Residence: Los Angeles, California  

Mr. R. said he could testify to the time pretty accurately as he had been checking the time in his telephone just prior to the sighting. 
He had been out on the front porch of his home at 1425 Lemon Grove Avenue, just off Normandy Avenue, Los Angeles, and made the observation from that location. The sighting was in a S.E.S. direction from his location.

Mr. R. stated that the moon was full and clear. For Los Angeles, it was a clear night, especially when looking upward.

Mr. R. said he couldn't determine how far away the object was, how high, or its exact size. He said it looked very low down. At first it appeared to be about saucer size, and then changed to a size of about a dinner plate. The light coming from the object was brighter than a dinner plate. The light looked like electrical house lights.
