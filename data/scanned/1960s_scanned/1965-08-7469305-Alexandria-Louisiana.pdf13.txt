The object appeared to be a very large vehicle with very bright lights around it an extremely bright light at a very high intensity at its base. The object appeared to be hovering at a very high altitude over the Esler Air Force Base near Alexandria City. As the object maneuvered it appeared to change shape. It was observed for several minutes and then accelerated away at a very high speed and disappeared from view.
