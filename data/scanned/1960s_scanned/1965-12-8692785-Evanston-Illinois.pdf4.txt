Gentlemen:

On Sep/23 last Dec.7,I saw a star-like object which moved almost exactly westward along over DEPAUL univ. and took a trajectory similar to that taken by a meteorite from here.It moved from higher elevation to lower as it went off and on the sky appeared to be distorted or not clear as it appeared to be on one side only.

I realize you can't answer all things,but if you have a moment,I'd appreciate knowing if my "UFO" was simply an unusual asteroid or a satellite whose motion estimate "gascock".

Thanks
