BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: "At 11:45 p.m. EDT the witness said she saw a bright light move rapidly across the sky from the NE to SW and then stop abruptly - it held still for a few seconds and then disappeared by seeming to go straight up rapidly, almost straight up.  It was like a brilliant star. The object was seen by the witness going behind some trees but she could not tell its actual size or shape because of the distance."
