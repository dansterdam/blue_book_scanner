The image contains three illustrations. The largest one is a compass rose diagram with the cardinal directions labeled. The other two illustrations appear to be schematic representations of a person's perspective of the surrounding landscape or environment, with a person standing on a road or path in the foreground.

6. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU WERE TRAVELING WHEN FIRST OBSERVED ON THE HORIZON. PLACE A 0 ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE OBJECT MOVED.
7. THIS WILL GIVE AN APPROXIMATE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "0" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON.
MOVEMENT: THE PHENOMENON MET SEEN AT AN AZIMUTH OF 270 DEGREES AND DISAPPEARED AT AN AZIMUTH OF 090 DEGREES. THUS, IT IS SEEN LATERALLY ACROSS THE FIELD OF VIEW, FOR EXAMPLE 10 TO 2 O'CLOCK AS VIEWED FACING THE LARGER SKETCH.
