Transcribing the text from the image:

So, as I could estimate, it covered about 10-12 seconds on my stopwatch and moved westward along the two minute time.

Weather conditions: Clear, cold, half-moon, a number of stars, but the item was blue and moved very low, just over the treetops.

Observation point: An East window, top floor, main office, the W.Va. Works, Conners Steel Division of H.R.E. Regional Inspection Supervisor's Office.

Note: this U.F.O. was visible only a present to light, it was too far away to make out a tail or superstructure. It did not pulse or dim out. It did not vanish or appear to change direction or speed at any time. This report in December of 1963.
