PROJECT MERCURY
Naval Air Missile Center, Naval Air Development Center, Naval Parachute Facility, and the Pacific Missile Range, under U.S. Navy management, is aiding in the operation of the Cannon Islands and the southern California tracking stations.
Support by the Department of Defense has, in general, been excellent for any requests or agreements between NASA and the particular military service concerned. As a rule, these agreements cover and above normal military operations.
Overall coordination of Department of Defense support for Project Mercury is handled by Gen. Leighton I. Davis, USAF, Department of Defense representative for Project Mercury, and Mr. Walter C. Williams, Associate Director of Project Mercury.
In addition, scores of working-level committees and coordinating groups have been organized, to effect day-by-day coordination between NASA and the military services, and industry.
PROJECT MERCURY FUNDING
Initial funding for Project Mercury was provided in fiscal year 1959, when $46,416,333 was obligated for Mercury research and development.
In fiscal year 1960, the obligation for research and development totaled $54,570,000, and for construction and equipment $57,595,000.
The fiscal year 1961 figures include supplemental funding of $12,500,000 for construction and $5,500,000 for construction and equipment.
Early in fiscal year 1960, Congress was advised that NASA intended to transfer $15 million from research and development appropriations to construction and equipment for construction of the Mercury network. The fiscal year 1960 figures reflect this fund transfer.
For fiscal year 1961, the current allocation of funds is $69,525,000 for research and development and $15 million for construction and equipment.
