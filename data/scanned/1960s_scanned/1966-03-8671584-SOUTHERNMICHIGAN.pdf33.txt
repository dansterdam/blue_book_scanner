There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

I therefore presented this likely explanation at the press conference. 
The entire matter of a full dress press conference was most distasteful to me because I would rather present carefully weighed and consistent evidence and conclusions to a body of scientific colleagues than to a barrage of fact-news hounds whose chief interest appears to be in getting a quick story. I recommend once again, as I have often in the past in my capacity as scientific consultant, that the UFO phenomenon which has now plagued us for a score of years, and has been responsible for countless words in newsprint during that time, should be recognized as a scientific and evidentiary problem of our times and studied as such by competent men in various fields. Further, the first recognition by any scientific investigation is concerned for the quality of the basic data, much more attention should be paid to the immediate gathering and processing of such data. I would be most happy to submit a more specific recommendation on the handling of this problem, based on my score of years of experience with the problem if this seems appropriate at this time.

All notes obtained were gathered all through my working hours on the three days are available in my files.
