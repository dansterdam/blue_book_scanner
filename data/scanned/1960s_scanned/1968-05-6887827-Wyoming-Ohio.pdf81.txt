The image contains a photographic illustration of a UFO, which is shown as a cigar-shaped object with flashing lights. The text above the image is titled "Not From Mars!" and describes the object as being sighted, with the witness stating that it was not a meteor or any known aircraft, and that the object hovered and flashed for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

Not From Mars!
"All right, let's not start calling every strange light in the sky a flying saucer from Mars," some will say. This man, however, is quite convinced that the object he saw this past week-end was no meteor, no airplane, no star and not anything generally recognized as a part of our world.
Here's what he told me: "I went outside for a smoke about 10:15 p.m. and immediately noticed a bright, steady light in the northwest sky. It appeared to be some distance away and quite high up. I watched it for several minutes and it did not move or blink like a star. Then, suddenly, it began flashing on and off, first rapidly, then at about one-second intervals.
"After flashing this way for four or five minutes, the object shot straight up and disappeared in a flash. The whole performance lasted about ten minutes. I am quite familiar with planes, satellites, meteors and the like, and this was definitely not anything I've ever seen before. I know about flying saucers, of course, but I have always been a bit skeptical about them. This, however, was so strange I can't think of any earthly explanation for it."
