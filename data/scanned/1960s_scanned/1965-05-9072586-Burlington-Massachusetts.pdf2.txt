Gentlemen:
I am very interested in U.F.O. sighting's own State. There have been sightings in my own Town, and my friend has seen them too. How would be very interesting if you would send me information on the U.F.O.'s. Also I would like to know how many States they have been seen in. I have read on this subject and find them very interesting.
I read an article in my home Town paper which is Titled "Chasing Flying Saucers" By George Fawcett. There is information there, but not as much as I would like. Please send me any thing you have on this Subject as I would like to know more about them. Thank you.
Yours truly
