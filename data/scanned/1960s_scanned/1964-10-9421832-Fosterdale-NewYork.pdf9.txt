NATURE NOTE
Rosary Pea
BEWARE of a bright red pea-bearing pod,
Two black seed in it. It looks beautiful, but it is
deadly poison.
The Rosary pea, sometimes called the Crab's
eye, is a bright scarlet pea-shaped pod containing two hard, black, shiny seeds. While the
plant is beautiful, it is one of the most deadly
plants known. Once the seeds are chewed and
swallowed, the plant's poison sets in, causing
violent vomiting, intestinal pain, trembling and
sometimes death.
A single pea can prove fatal to a human being.
Children are often attracted to the pretty scarlet
pods and the shiny black seeds, not realizing
the deadly danger within. Take care to keep the
children away from these plants.
