The sighting occurred on the evening of may 7 1962 at approximately 11:30 pm. I was outside my home in Glen Falls, New York, looking up at the sky. There was a bright object crossing the sky from north to south that was moving very rapidly. It seemed to change direction to the west, then continued on its original course to the south. It was much larger than any satellite or star, and seemed to have a reddish glow around the edges. It disappeared from view after about 2 minutes. There appeared to be no sound or trace of the object. I was very surprised and puzzled by what I saw, as it did not resemble any known aircraft. I have seen satellites and other objects in the sky before, but this was very different and quite unusual. I would be very interested to know if anyone else reported seeing the same object that evening.
