Dear Sirs:
The letter you will find is the same one I sent to General Mills Balloon and Research Station, as indicated in paragraph third which read as follows:
"I may be told with considerable interest your letter of September 6 in which you describe many strange sights which you saw in the sky in recent days."
The General Alluminum Company, and Raven Industries, all within a few hundred miles of Minnesota. We inspected the sites of the September 6 sighting. We find that these unexplained sightings have been in the air of this area for some time.
I am making the liberty of returning your letter which you sent to us and I hope you will find success in securing more information regarding this matter. Good luck.
Dear Sirs:
I am writing to you at the suggestion of our local police department to answer a question which has several of us extremely curious. It's about some objects we've seen in the sky.
