Knock-out Blow at Felixstowe

[UNDER the heading "UNDER THE HEADING KNOCK-OUT BLOW AT FELIXSTOWE" there is a lengthy text describing an encounter with an unidentified flying object. The text discusses the sighting by a driver and his passenger, and their experience of the object hovering above their car and causing a temporary blackout or knockout effect.]

There was a high-pitched humming noise, and the entire car seemed to have stilled and collapsed. This was described in the opening paragraph. The text then goes on to describe the location near where Paul Green (as mentioned in a previous article) had also encountered an unidentified flying object. The report states that Dr. Finch, a professional investigator, looked into the case. It also mentions the 25-year-old driver of the car in which the incident occurred. The text then describes the timing of the incident around 10:30 p.m. and the reactions of the witnesses. The report concludes by stating that the author himself wondered where the car window to see the object was pointing, and he looked but could not determine the car window's orientation relative to the object.
