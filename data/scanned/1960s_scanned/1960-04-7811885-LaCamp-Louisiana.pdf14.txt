STATEMENT

1. On 25 Apr 1959, I was working the shift (23.30-07.15) on the llth of April 1959. I had just turned a C-121 type aircraft out on departure and checked his low equipment, also aiding in the preflight. 

I noticed this A/C out approximately 35 miles and cleared him engines on.

I was sitting at the scope position talking to Tower on the land line for approximately 10 minutes more. I then hung up and was watching the Radar scopes which was set on the 20 mile range with ten mile range marks.

I observed an UIP target coming in from the Northwest at approximately 5 miles out. It appeared the target was moving at a tremendous speed. I immediately called and alerted Tower for a possible radio out aircraft. Tower looked for a/c and reported none. The UIP target came down the extended center line of runway 11 and disappeared in the vortex of the scope for approximately one minute and then I observed target going back out on a heading of 330 degrees. The target when visible indicated speeds I & 3 for positive identification.

I changed my Mode selector to Mode 2 and target disappeared. I then turned my Radar beacon off, and target disappeared. I then switched my selector back to Mode 1 and 3 and turned beacon on again. The target was approximately 6 miles out on 3t5 - outbound. I called New Orleans center for a/c in vicinity of Alexandria and they reported none. I called local GCI site and asked them if they had the target on their weapon. They reported negative, but had BIF target ringing the scope. I kept tracking target until he was 20 miles to the Northwest in which time GCI never reported contact. The target then disappeared from my scopes with a capability of 100 miles radar coverage. I watched the 200 mile secondary scopes and the only target within 200 miles again was approximately 190 miles.
