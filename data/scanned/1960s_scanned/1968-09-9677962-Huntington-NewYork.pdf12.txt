The image appears to be a scan of a page from a Project Blue Book report. It contains a sketch or drawing of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified aerial object. The text below the image states "SHOW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENA. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROJECTIONS, AND INDICATE AGAINST OR VAPOR TRAIL. INDICATES IF THE PHENOMENA WAS MOVING." Beneath that, there is a hand-drawn sketch of an elliptical or oval-shaped object with some text written underneath it.

The text in the document states:
