The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, specifically a proposed reply to a letter regarding an unidentified observation of a bright glowing ball in March 1966.

Proposed reply to letter from
Dear
Reference your unidentified observation in March 1966 of an unusual bright glowing ball that was observed by both you and your wife. We have studied the information submitted and are unable to locate the exact stimuli. Without the exact date and more precise information on how the object disappeared we are unable to make a complete investigation.
It is possible that you observed an astronomical body. However, the only such body in the immediate part of the sky where you observed the object in March, was the star Antares. This is reddish in color and should not have appeared bright blue-white. As such, the information you submitted is categorized as insufficient data for evaluation and filed accordingly.
