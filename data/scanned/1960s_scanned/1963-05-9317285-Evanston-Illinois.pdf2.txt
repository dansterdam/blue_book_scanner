[Handwritten text]:
We have been watching this thing for about 1 1/2 hours. It would appear, disappear, reappear, move around & remain stationary at times. It seemed to be surrounded by a haze or glow and was illuminated. The color of the object varied from white to reddish-orange and it seemed to be metallic in appearance. There appeared to be no visible means of propulsion and no sound could be heard. At times it seemed to cast a shadow on the ground. The object was estimated to be about 30-40 feet in diameter and was at an estimated altitude of 3000 feet. There were no other aircraft in the area at the time. We have no explanation for what we observed and hope this report will assist in determining what this object was.
