The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

The text in the document can be transcribed as follows:

"YO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
1 AUG 196a
Claim: AES, Harrison

Dear Sirs:

The President has asked that I reply to your letter concerning unidentified flying objects. This reply is made to the press release which you enclosed in your letter. The Commander of the Ballistic Air Force Station in Michigan has stated that he was on duty on 5 August 1965 and that no unidentified flying objects were tracked on radar. There was no report made to this extract:

We have not yet received the evaluation of the sightings' data reports. This will be interpreted to show that the unidentified objects picked up or tracked on radar have been analyzed as flocks of birds, weather phenomena, or reflections from ground targets.

I am enclosing a report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects. This report will provide you with information on this program since its origin in 1948.

I will be happy to offer assistance in providing this information to you.

Sincerely,"
