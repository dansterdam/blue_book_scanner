The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a declassified military document, specifically a "Naval Message" from the Navy Department.

NAVAL MESSAGE
UNCLASSIFIED
NAVY DEPARTMENT

The text in the document discusses an "Unidentified Flying Object Report" where an object was observed near Vandenberg Air Force Base. The object was described as egg-shaped, nickel in color, approximately 5 feet in size, and exhibiting no sound. The object was observed for about 30 minutes and moved towards Vandenberg Air Force Base before disappearing from sight. The analysis seems to indicate that the report is considered "insignificant" by the Navy.
