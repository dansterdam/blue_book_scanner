The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

I clearly observed both objects about 2 minutes and therefore I was about 6 feet or close to that and size of them)-both were in the same direction with Verrazzano bridge far to the left and with dim a between them-both objects were above Staten Island but I am sure that they were many miles behind my latitude-after my observation the small round object began to shine with a bright flash (as if touching fire)-so about 4-5 seconds later the light distinguished at once-both objects became dim and they began to withdraw in the direct line from me very rapidly-they diminished in the range manner and disappeared.
I am deeply convinced that both objects were UFO-s. I am only trying to give a the possibilities-descriptive desription of what I have "seen" without any unnecessary additions.
My personala are following: I am 75 years old, former judge and lawyer in Europe where war "now I am working as organist in the church in Southbrooklyn,God thanks mentally that Almighty God for "giving Service"; since 6-7 years and I am very alert, for all UFO apparitions. I don, t read or watch any so called "Science Fiction" (TV).
Please excuse me this I am badly Your-and my personal too-personally I am deeply convinced in the existence of the extraterrestrial,flying machines which are visiting and watching our Earth.
Please accept from me the words my deepest gratitude.
Sincerely yours
