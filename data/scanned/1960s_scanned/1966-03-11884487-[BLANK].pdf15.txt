NICAP BACKGROUND
(1536 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036)
NICAP--the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena--is the only full-time private organization investigating UFOs in the United States.
It was founded in 1956 to fill the need for an independent agency which could conduct research openly and seriously on a subject which was bogged down in official secrecy, public ridicule and the baseless wild tales of publicity seekers.
Among NICAP's more than 7500 members are over 300 professional scientists and engineers, at least 200 professional pilots, active and retired military officers, doctors, lawyers, businessmen, and other professional persons.
NICAP's operations involve:
1. Collecting data on UFO sightings;
2. Investigating the most promising cases through 25 Subcommittees composed of technically-trained volunteers throughout the country;
3. Analyzing and evaluating this data with the help of a Panel of Advisors--specialists in many branches of science and engineering;
4. Making the significant data available to the scientific community, Government and the press.
Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC (Ret.), was appointed NICAP Director in 1957, and Richard Hall was appointed his assistant in 1958.
In 1964, NICAP submitted its "UFO Evidence" report to Congress. This thoroughly-documented 200,000 word report is an analysis of investigations through 1963, containing data on the best 750 UFO cases selected from more than 5,000 in NICAP's files. More than 10,000 copies are in the hands of scientific research organizations, government agencies, universities, military installations and libraries.
