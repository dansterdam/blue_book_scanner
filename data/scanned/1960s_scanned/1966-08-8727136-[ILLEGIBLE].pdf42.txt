35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

All of the stars stars were visible in the sky at that time of night. 
There were only wispy clouds and the air seemed very clear.
There were no planes, helicopters, or satellites in the sky that I am aware of.
The object seemed to be propelled at an extremely high rate of speed.
I am not certain, but I think the object was metallic or at least had a light, metallic surface.
Regrettably, I did not observe it in detail long enough to provide a more complete description.
This sighting was somewhat frightening to me at the time, and I did not feel very rational about attempting to observe and analyze it in detail.
The object disappeared from sight so quickly, there was no time for me to gather any kind of scientific data about it.
I regret that I cannot provide more concrete information about this sighting that would be useful in identifying the nature of the object I observed.
