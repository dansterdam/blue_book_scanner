14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
DISAPPEARED IN MOMENTS BURST OF SPEED

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

a. Sound: 20 SOUND DISCERNIBLE SLIGHT WIND THAT MAY) 
b. Color: BRIGHT METALLIC LOOKING OBJECT WITH LIGHT

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and indicate by an arrow the direction the object was moving. Place an arrow inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
