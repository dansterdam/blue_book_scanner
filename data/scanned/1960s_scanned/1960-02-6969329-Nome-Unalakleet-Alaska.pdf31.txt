NORAD PROBES FLYING OBJECT

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP)- The people of Nome, Alaska, are not excited that the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) in Colorado Springs said they had "unconfirmed" reports from civilians saying a flying object had been sighted over Alaska.
"NORAD had received no reports of a flying object from Nome," said the spokesman.
The reports were made to the observation center at Colorado Springs on Sunday evening and were relayed to NORAD, the spokesman said.
"It was registered on 'any military devices such as radar, nothing to excite it,' the spokesman said. "If they wanted to reports a flying object, moving slowly northwest in the direction of Nome, Unalakleet, Alaska."
The second report, also from civilians in the area, said the object "was handled through normal channels" as an unidentified flying object.
The spokesman said that reports on this object from civilian sources at Unalakleet and other areas were being investigated.
"NORAD officials in Colorado Springs said they were merely standing by to be advised of any further reports on the object.
The spokesman said there were no details available on what the object was or its speed or altitude. He said, "If there really was an object there and it wasn't tracked by the radar - it was handled by the control room."
