The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing various types of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that have been observed and reported, including unconventional aircraft, meteorological phenomena, and other high-altitude objects.

The text of the document is as follows:

introduce, ad hoc, another phenomenon in explanation.
Confirmed identifications of UFOs have been made with 
the following: unconventional aircraft; aircraft under
uncommon weather conditions; aircraft with unusual external
light patterns; meteorological and other high-altitude bal-
loons; artificial earth satellites; flocks of birds; reflec-
tions of searchlights or headlights off clouds; reflection
of sunlight from shiny surfaces; luminescent organisms, in-
cluding one case of a firefly lodged between two adjacent
panes of glass in an airplane cockpit window; optical mirages
and looming; lenticular cloud formations; ball lightning;
sundogs; meteors, including the rare green fireballs; planets,
especially Venus; bright stars; and the Aurora Borealis.
Radar detection of unidentified flying objects has also oc-
curred occasionally. Many of these sightings have been ex-
plained in terms of radar reflection off temperature inversion
layers in the atmosphere, and other sources of radar "angels."
Considering the difficulties in tracing out the visual 
and radar sightings, it is remarkable that all but about 1%
of the reported UFOs have been identified as naturally-
occurring -- if sometimes unusual -- phenomena. In October,
1957, Sputnik I, the first earth-orbiting artificial satel-
lite, was launched. Of the 1,178 sightings in that year,
701 occurred between October and December. There is a clear
