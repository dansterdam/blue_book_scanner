UFO Observation & Photographs, 7 July 1967

1. Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs of 7 July 1967. Photo analysis has been accomplished with the following results:

Visible examination reveals that the "unidentified object" is partially visible in the frames merged of the negative, and that the imagery is not the result of double exposure or retouching. The object is not visible in its entirety due to the fact that about 1/5 inch has been cropped from the left margin of the negative. The object appears to be symmetrical and contained what appear to be structure of medium size that extends from the center of the bottom edge of the negative almost to the center of the frame. Source indicates the entire length is attached to his neighbor's house.

2. The object appears as an elliptical in shape. Its length being about twice its width. It displays medium reflectivity and is fuzzy around the perimeter. A narrow band displaying slightly greater reflectivity is positioned along its minor axis. No reason or purpose has been determined for this change in reflection.

3. The exposure was made with a fixed focus camera having a nominal focal length of 105 inches. Bracket settings indicate the object was 100-200 feet in distance and covered about 200 feet above his neighbor's house. The clarity of detail and relative size of the antenna indicate that source was perhaps 75 feet from the object as it was about 200 feet from the object as it.

4. If, indeed, the object had the 100-200 foot diameter (as stated by source) it would have had to be 500-1,600 feet from the camera to produce the imagery recorded.
