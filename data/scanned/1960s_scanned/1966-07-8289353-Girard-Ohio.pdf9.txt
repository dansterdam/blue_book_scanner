The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten letter or document discussing a UFO observation. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text present in the document:

Dear Sir,
A detailed examination of U.F.O. observation which may be of interest to you was recently made at Warren A.F.B. This observation was of an excellent visual and photographic nature, and it is pertinent to your files. It occurred May 16, 1965 at approximately 8:10 PM, CST, near the town of Girard, Ohio. The object was observed to be approximately 50 feet in diameter, ovoid in shape, and glowing orange in color. It was observed for approximately 30 minutes, during which time it performed various maneuvers, including vertical ascent and descent, and lateral movement. It was observed by several reliable witnesses, including a university professor, a businessman, and a military officer.
Samples of the photographic coverage were processed, and copies are attached for your information. This report is forwarded for your consideration and use.
Sincerely,
John H. Girard
Colonel, U.S.A.F.
Commanding
