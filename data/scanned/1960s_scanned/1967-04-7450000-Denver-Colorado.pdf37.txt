The object was a dark, reddish-orange light which appeared to be coming from a high altitude. It seemed to be moving in a zigzag pattern and was visible for approximately 5 to 10 minutes. The size was comparable to a basketball at arm's length. No distinct outline or shape was observed, just a bright light. As I watched, the light suddenly disappeared from view.
