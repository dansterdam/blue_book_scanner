I am the object of the report to you. It looked to me to be as large as my house, with a movement in every direction. It seems to be moving up and down and vibrating as a glowing bright object a big light like shape. It will definitely be a sighting to me and my husband and son also the scene. 25 husband said son "let's go home".
