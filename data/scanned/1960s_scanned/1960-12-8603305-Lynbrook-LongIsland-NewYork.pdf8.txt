Sept 17, 1961

Reported on October 12, 1961. My husband and I were looking out of a window in our home about 9:30 p.m. when we saw a bright light moving in the western sky. At first we thought it was a plane, but it was moving much faster than any plane we had ever seen. It appeared to be oblong in shape and red in color. As it moved it seemed to change shape, sometimes appearing round, other times oblong. It moved in a zig-zag fashion, then would stop momentarily, then dart off in another direction. The speed with which it moved was incredible. After watching it for about 2 or 3 minutes, it suddenly disappeared. We have never seen anything like it before and have racked our brains trying to figure out what it could have been. We are both very level-headed and certainly not prone to imagining things. This was a definite, unexplained phenomenon which we observed with our own eyes. I would be very interested to know if anyone else in this area observed the same thing at about the same time.
