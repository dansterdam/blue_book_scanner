Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This letter follows up our telephone conversation the other evening. I also apologize for the opportunity of thanking you for the information as requested.

I'm also enclosing a duplicate for your own files.

I would very much appreciate if you would again continue of the longer letter you mentioned on the phone. That this there must be a perfectly natural explanation for the sighting lighting and motion, but I would hope that you can give me the latest details on the subject. My interest is in the theory and angular rates of motion, relative placement of lights, etc.

It occurs on November 8, that this lights you saw were actually quite some distance away, and moving rather rapidly, but towards the horizon very low. Just returning to more normal height. These lights were off, and certainly no attempt is intended to making an absolute statement.

It occasionally happens also, that distant objects, such as (a) church steeple) silhouetted against the sky, may present a flickering appearance, like to some observers as moving lights. Short, I am asking whether you have there is any chance that this might have been a mistaken observation in which moving lights a considerable distance gave the impression of nearer and faster motion which did not in fact occur. Of course, and I'm advancing this only as a suggestion.

Please read this letter carefully and please don't forget to send along a copy of the letter you mentioned.

Sincerely yours,
[REDACTED]
J. Allen Hynek
Director
