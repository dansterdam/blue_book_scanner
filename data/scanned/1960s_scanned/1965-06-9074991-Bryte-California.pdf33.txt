GT-4?

On June 3, 1965, GT-4 Pilot Major James McDivitt and Lt. Jlhjor David Price Walker Edward White were launched into orbit from Cape Kennedy. 
Major McDivitt stated that while in the GT-4 spacecraft, at an altitude of 122 miles, he and Lt. Col. White saw an object outside their window. They got out of the GT-4 and walked through the hatch into deep space.
Major McDivitt wrote a letter to Maj or McDivitt relates that he has seen a great number of pecullar lights and objects while in the space flight even in the day. However, in almost every instance he was unable to identify the objects.
The objects observed were all unidentified as to shape and size of and not be able to explain. "This object that I observed I just haven't been able to identify what it was." However, I know that there have been many reports of UFO's, and I'm sure mine is one of those as well.

Major McDivitt sighted three objects maneuvering in space during the four day space flight.
McDivitt made one other contact while over Hawaii. He took five frames of movie film of it, but officials said all it showed was a "tail of light and a faintile glow. (Cover photo-1 went into the 12 slint orbit at Ibloor.)
McDivitt spotted the second object during the 20th orbit, as the spacecraft was moving at 17,500 m.p.h. This object appeared to gain speed and altitude rapidly, and appeared to be larger and brighter than the one sighted earlier.
