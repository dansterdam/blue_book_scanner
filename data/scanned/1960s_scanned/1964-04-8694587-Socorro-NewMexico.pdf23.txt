A Taos New Mexico, United States law enforcement officer, police sergeant, named Lonnie Zamora, reported seeing a landed craft and two small human-like figures near it on April 24, 1964, in Socorro, New Mexico. The document describes how Zamora heard a roar and saw an object rise rapidly from the ground, leaving deep impressions. It also mentions that the New Mexico State Police captain, who investigated the incident, said it was "definitely something" and that other reports of similar sightings were received around the state.
