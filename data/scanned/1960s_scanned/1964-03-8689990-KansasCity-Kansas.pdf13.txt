SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for FEBRUARY 22, 1964
THE FIELDS
ENTOMOLOGY
Indian Insect
To Fight West Pest
CANBERRA, QUEENSLAND'S worst insect pest, a boring beetle that ravages forests in New South Wales, may be brought under control by an Indian insect parasite. The beetle, Sirex noctilio, is estimated to cost the Australian forestry industry between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000 a year. 
John Mann, director of the biological section of the Queensland Department of Forests, has returned from a four-month mission where he collected large numbers of a parasite wasp, Rhyssa persuasoria, to launch field trials in Queensland.
The parasite, a boring beetle, will be effective under Queensland conditions in bringing the Sirex borer under control, Mann believes. They will be released in the Forestry Department's Sherwood laboratory, where they will be held to complete their life cycle, then liberated in the field. They will be ready for field tests which will begin this year.
ENGINEERING
Improved Traffic Flow
Can Save Many Lives
MORE THAN 23,000 LIVES could be saved each year if rational controls were applied to street and highway systems, traffic engineers believe. Much of the traffic congestion on city streets, overcrowding of certain streets and roads, and the resulting accidents, deaths and delays could be prevented through proper application of traffic engineering principles.
Efficient flow of vehicular traffic on streets and roads is essential to the economic life of a city. It contributes to saving time, energy and expense for both individuals and the community as a whole. Many a city has lost industry or seen its growth hampered by inadequate and congested traffic arteries.
But better vehicle design will only partly reduce the drag and congestion. What is needed is the application of advanced traffic engineering know-how.
