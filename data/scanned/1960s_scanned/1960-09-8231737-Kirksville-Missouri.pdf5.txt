1. Reference your memos dated 21 Sep 60 and 29 Sep 60.
2. All three radar sightings reported are from the same radar station and were noted on the same radar equipment. This equipment is quite powerful and occasionally picks up reflections from various weather situations such as is encountered when dealing with cold dry air. The appearance and disappearance of targets as reported, along with the extremely rapid changes in altitude, indicate to the possibility that some form of weather condition was responsible for the unidentified targets which were reported.
3. No reports of similar targets have been received from other stations in the area which might have confirmed or denied this explanation.
