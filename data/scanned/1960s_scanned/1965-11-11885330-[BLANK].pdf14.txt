Dear Dr. Roberts,

Now back in Belgium, we have, Dr. Roland and myself, to thank again you and your collaborators (in particular Mr. A.L. Morris) for your help and all the advices which have been given to us during our last visit.

We have also visited the balloon facilities in Holloman Air Force Base, and we appreciate is now clear. The telemetry and ground commands were excellent during our experiment, and we have no more any reason to hesitate. You will find, here enclosed, a "more official" letter signed by Prof. Migeotte, and applying formally for NCAR collaboration to fly our gondola.

Confident that our project will be considered with attention, we thank you again, and repeat that we will be pleased to receive you at the Jungfraujoch.

Very sincerely yours,
L. DELBOUILLE
