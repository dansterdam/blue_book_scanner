UFO Sighting

Mr. USAF SARGIL-CC (Mrs. Hunt)
Analysis personnel have revised their investigation of the sighting of 7 Dec 1965 near Northwestern University. The investigation and description of the incident and interview with Mrs. Hunt has been completed. While it has not been identified, there are several research institutes flying lampost vehicles which could be the source. Northwestern University is one such project and the launch site is at the Philadelphia Co. plant; observations of this report is a possible correlation.
