11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Three observers called Craig AFB and reported seeing an orange glowing object in the sky: it moved in a straight line. The investigating officer said that he and another officer at approximately 8:11 CST were on the flight line and observed a B-52 east of Craig AFB pulling a short contrail. Both the B-52 and the contrail were glowing orange in color. It was his opinion that this is what the three witnesses saw.
