The object was first observed through binoculars by staff sergeant and two neighbors, at 1930 local time. Object, elongated, about the size of a Piper Cub airplane, was observed as it moved across the sky and out over the Missouri River. It was launched at 1915 and 1925, so this object is eliminated as a weather balloon. Object was observed on 3 August and 2 September.
