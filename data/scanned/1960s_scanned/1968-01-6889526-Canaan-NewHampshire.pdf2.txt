Canaan, New Hampshire, December 7, 1968

Brighter than usual aircraft pares: 
At about 3 o'clock in the afternoon of January 14, 1968, I stood before a series of motion of what appeared to be an unusually bright object in the sunset sky. At first it seemed like a jet contrail, but soon I realized it was something quite different. It was moving quite swiftly, leaving a sharply defined, evenly bright trail. It moved in a straight line, was observed for only a short period of time, perhaps 2-3 minutes, then disappeared from view. The light was brilliant, whiter than a welding arc. It was not like a meteor or anything I had ever seen before in the sky. 

This incident does not tie in with any accounts of military activity in the area at the time. I turned my attention to it, watched it carefully, but am unable to account for its nature or origin. The next morning the sky was normal.
