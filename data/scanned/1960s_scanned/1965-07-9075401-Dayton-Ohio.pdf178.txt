This image does not contain any photographs, only some sketches and text. The sketches appear to be related to a UFO sighting report, with instructions for the observer to draw diagrams showing the motion and positioning of objects observed.

The text in the image is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the point where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the point where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
