The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an analysis report with a table showing the composition percentages of various elements in a sample. There is no human face visible in the image.

The text in the document is as follows:

However, this entire analysis proves only the very thin layer just the surface, and in this layer the proportion of Barium is very high.

A comparison was made between Sample #2 and standard containing the following:

Ba 15.%
Zr 0.6
Sr 2.0 
Fe 4.0
Mn 2.0
Cr 1.5
Ag 90.
Ni 2.

The results indicated that the sample contained all of these elements, with perhaps 1% variation above and below the percentages shown. The proportion of Barium is high because in a analysis of the surface layer.As indicated in the previous section, Aluminum and Titanium also make up part of the specimen.

Without destroying the sample by homo-genizing it, we cannot make any quantitative estimates of analysis by weight. However, the following guesses might be put forward on the basis of the surface layer examination.

Element	Percent Composition
Ba		15.%
Zr		0.6
Sr		2.0
Fe		4.0
Mn		2.0
Cr		1.5
Ag		90.
Ni		2.
