LETTER OR DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

The handwritten text states:
"The object that I watched was very intense. the lights that I saw - I do not believe to be a part of conventional aircraft. we watched the movement of these lights to be rather unusual. in the report questions - the movement of these lights fits no particular pattern. we watched them move and disappear so swiftly."

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
"The object just seemed to leave, it moved at a high rate of speed and watched it disappear from our view that was quite sudden, for a moment or two we just looked at the area where it left and when we looked back it was gone."

B. DID THE DESCRIPTION MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
