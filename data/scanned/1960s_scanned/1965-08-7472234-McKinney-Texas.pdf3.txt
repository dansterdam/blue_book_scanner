MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS SEEN OVER AREA
By GEORGE CARTER

Bright colored lights and strange unidentified flying objects have been sighted over the McKinney area the past two days, according to information received at the McKinney Police Department.
Highway patrolmen also report seeing the strange objects last night. Patrolman Bennett Anderson of the McKinney Police Department said he saw a strange red object hovering in the sky for several minutes about 9 p.m. Tuesday. He said it seemed to be moving in a spiral fashion and then suddenly disappeared.
About 10 p.m. Tuesday, a number of other persons telephoned the police department to report seeing strange lights in the sky. They were described as red, blue and white and seemed to be moving in an erratic fashion.
"We are puzzled by these reports," one officer said. "We have no explanation for them."
The Associated Press reported similar sightings in other areas of Texas this week.
