The image shared appears to be a photograph from an old UFO report document. The photograph shows a blank page with some handwritten text that reads: "The sighting of these strange object might be of some importance. However a photo of what the sceen looked like would ringer". The rest of the text is redacted.

As an OCR system, I can output the following text from the document:

The sighting of these strange object might be of some importance. However a photo of what the sceen looked like would ringer.
Sincerely, [REDACTED]
