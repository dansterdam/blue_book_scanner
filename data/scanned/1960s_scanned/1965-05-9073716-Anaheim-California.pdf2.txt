On 13 May 65, Dr J Allen Hynek spoke to Mr C G Allen, a California, concerning a sighting on 1 May 65 in Anaheim, California. At the time he was in an Apollo Space Craft. It was one of the strangest things he has ever witnessed. It was brighter than immediate stars.

The object was brilliant brighter than Venus as evening star. It traveled south from 175 degrees North to South, then disappeared very fast at about a 15 to 20 degree angle.

The object was moving, but not erratic. Its motion was brighter than immediate stars and changed in brightness, size, and color. It changed from a brilliant white to a reddish color, then to a bluish color, and finally a greenish color. It then disappeared very fast at about a 15 to 20 degree angle. It would be most difficult to fall out of a roll. It appeared to only be a few 100 yards away and maybe 100 yards long.

Object was in the sky directly overhead at 50 degree elevation. It was 45-50 feet long when first sighted, 17-18 feet wide, cigar shaped, clear white, no trail. As it moved it varied in size, thought maybe it was rotating. Do not recall it going in front of any stars, just about in the middle of the sky. Was not blinking.

He suggested that it might have been a burn out after a reentry. Time was 1012 local. Object looked like it was going to come down. Observer thought perhaps it was going to crash, but it simply disappeared and no sound, no clouds, no distortion at all, other than it got smaller and smaller.

Object was about gone in 5 or 6 seconds. Impression of going up and away, only because object faded, no sound, no trail, no distortion, no satellite motion. The only unusual thing was the definite change in the size and shape of the object.
