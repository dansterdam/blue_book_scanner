TRANSCRIPT OF PHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN HYNEK & METZ

H    Is Mr. there?
M    This is he.
H    Well, Hi, this is Allen Hynek at Northwestern University.
M    How do you do sir. I didn't get to see you when you were down. 
H    No, and I'm sorry about that. What happened?
M    Well, I'll tell you what happened. There were several things that happened. 1) I didn't get a phone call telling me when to meet you or METZ: and I didn't know exactly when to meet you.
H    Well now, I definitely sent the letter, because . . so something just must have gone wrong, because I was short of at the airport there in Columbia I was looking around for you. 
M    Well, the mail service, I guess, didn't come through that time. Probably what happened I built a new home, see, and they probably got the mail confused.
H    Yes. Something must have happened because I was definitely disappointed in not seeing you there . Then, I thought, my reaction, unfortunately, I guess, was the wrong one. I thought to myself, well, He doesn't care enough about this, so 
M    No, I care enough about it, but I also am not uncouth and therefore, I wouldn't go where I haven't been intended to go or invited, and so consequently I did not, since I did not receive your letter, or your phone call, I figured that you had made other plans, and I excused it at that level.
H    Yes. Well, two hits - no runs, no hits and two errors. Uh?
M    Absolutely right. I really didn't - this didn't bother me at all.
