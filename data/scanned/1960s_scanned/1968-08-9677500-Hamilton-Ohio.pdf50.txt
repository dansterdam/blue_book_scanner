The image appears to be a photographic reproduction of a weather or astronomical chart or diagram, possibly from a UFO report document. The image does not contain any human faces or identifiable individuals. The image appears to show a complex diagram with various lines, curves, and symbols, but I do not see any distinct photographic elements.
