The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch of a landscape with mountains or hills in the distance. The text below the sketch provides instructions on how to describe any photograph that may be present, but in this case there is no photograph, only the sketch.

Transcribing the text from the document:

No Exhaust
No Vapors 
No Noise
No Percussion

This is about how to estimate the size of the object in comparison to a known object, such as a match held at arm's length in front of a known object. The text indicates that the object could only partially cover or obscure the known object when held at a certain distance, and the fraction of the known object covered could be estimated.

The text then states that "Length would just about cover the object when first sighted, but would only half cover it as it went overhead."
