AIR DEFENSE
TWO OBJECTS SEEN
EARLY MONDAY IN
SKIES OVER ALASKA

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA (AP) - A spokesman for the Alaskan Air Command said today that unidentified flying objects were observed in the skies over the early Alaskan morning.

The spokesman said at 2 a.m. yesterday the command center at NORAD received reports of two objects in the skies over Nome and Unalakleet, Alaska.

The objects, the spokesman said, were described as bright lights which moved rapidly and silently across the sky. The objects also produced a flash which was observed at Nome, it was reported.

THE SECOND OBJECT was described as a bright light moving at a high rate of speed and finally disappearing from view, the spokesman said.

Whether the objects reported are explainable or are, in fact, unidentified flying objects, officials said, is a subject of the continuing investigation.

Command officials reported that no additional information is available regarding the sighting of the unidentified objects.

THE SIGHTINGS were reported from civilian observers in the Nome and Unalakleet areas, the spokesman said.
