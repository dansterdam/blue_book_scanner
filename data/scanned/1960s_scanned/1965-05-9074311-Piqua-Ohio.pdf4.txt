UFO form continued
At 11-15 P.M. we noticed. And didn't want to leave. I was with my roommate. We were walking towards the barn when my roommate screamed and said there was a bright light in the sky. I looked up and saw a round object with a small blinking light on the bottom of it hovering over the barn. I did not report it of the reason, I was scared that they wouldn't believe me. While I was walking home after seeing this object, my mind began to think of what I had seen. My roommate and I are still puzzled over what we saw that night. I do not report this incident to anyone at the time of the observation.
