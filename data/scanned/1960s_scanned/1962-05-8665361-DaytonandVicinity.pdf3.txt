Dear Sir:

This letter is an response to your letter regarding the sighting of a flying object on May 9, 1962.

According to our investigation, the object you observed was probably a meteor or some other astronomical phenomenon. In most cases, reported sightings of unidentified flying objects can be explained as misidentification of known objects or phenomena. Without more detailed information about the object you saw, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the sighting.

While we understand the interest and concern over unidentified flying objects, our analysis suggests this particular sighting does not represent anything extraordinary or requiring further investigation by Project Blue Book at this time.

If you have any additional information or would like to discuss this matter further, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
