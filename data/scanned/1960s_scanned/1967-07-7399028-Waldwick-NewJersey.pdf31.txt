The image appears to contain a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. There is no photograph present in this image. I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

Date 1967 April 5.32 G.M.T.
Time past time at end point 92 sec
Apparent elevation at end point: 
- at 20° = 42° 52' 2 = 48° 28' at 129 km
Ending ele at 89 km 
Ending azm at 89 km 23° 11' 0 = 44° 23' at 81 km
Altitude: s= 555 km h = 519.3 km 
Observed velocity: 41 km/sec
Radiant with atmosphere correction h = 19.3
         a = 144.1°
         d = 39.2°
Parabolic orbit: 
a = 146.9" 
e = 1.0
q = 0.93 A.U.

FIREBALL of 1967 July 24.69 G.M.T.
I.A.U.C. No. 2113

This fireball is unique, so far as the writer knows, in that it appeared over the Atlantic Ocean and its radiant was determined by the Project Duplication Team, W.W. Salisbury of the National Research Council, Canada, and others. The essential data follow in order:
Arrival time: 1967 July 24.69 G.M.T.
Duration: 3.0 sec.
Brightness: Comparable to full moon
Trajectory: Last seen heading upward and slightly ESE.
Apparent altitude of point of disappearance: 15 to 20 deg. (precise value uncertain)

R.A. = 20° 31', DEC = +46° 36', 20° 10.15 sec.
H = 155° 50', W = 55° 28' PI = 19° 30' D = 1.10 sec.
H = 13° 30', W = 52° 55', PI = 16° 37' D = 0.90 sec. 
H = 11° 00', W = 51° 00', PI = 14° 01' D = 0.75 sec.
H = 9° 00', W = 49° 15', PI = 12° 18' D = 0.60 sec.
(Precise times uncertain)

It is obvious that as two longitude and three latitude are given only to whole degrees, the precision of the results is compromised. The duration, however, is 3.0 sec. with a beginning flash lasting 0.2 sec. as seen at all stations. Such reported events differ because of differences in sensitivity, location etc. This fireball is considered to be a real event, being reported from several stations throughout eastern North America. Its brightness suggests that the apparent magnitude may well have been -12 or even more. For location, the usual place would be a spot in the Atlantic Ocean about 75 n mi SE of New Jersey, latitude 38° N, longitude 72° W.

Date 1967 July 24.69 G.M.T.
Ending over 65.90° W 37° N, at 99.6° h = 15 km
Path ling 65.90° W 
Path 39 km 
Radiant uncorrected R.A. = 304°, DEC = 24°

It is obvious that the solution is too approximate to warrant calculation of an orbit, but despite this shortcoming, the fireball's probable errors in the sightings, the conditions are too unique and to place this fireball on record.
