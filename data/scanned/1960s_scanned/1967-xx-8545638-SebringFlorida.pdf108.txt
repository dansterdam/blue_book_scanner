AT SEA TO THE EAST.

COMMENTS
MR BRAY HAS NOT NOTED JET AIRCRAFT FLYING AT LOW LEVEL AT ABOUT THAT
DISTANCE AWAY FROM HIM, AND SO CANNOT MAKE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THAT
AND THE OBJECT OBSERVED. HIS ESTIMATE OF ALTITUDE AND DISTANCE ARE
ADMITTEDLY RATHER ROUGH APPROXIMATIONS, A BETTER ESTIMATE MIGHT BE
CALCULATED SEF THE LETTERS ON THE BARGE CARGO & LETTERS OBSERVED, WHICH
WAS REPORTED AS ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE AWAY AND THE 12 POWER BINOCULARS
THROUGH WHICH THE LETTERS WERE CLEARLY VISIBLE.
MR --- HAS, AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT, NOT TALKED TO ANYONE OTHER
THAN HIS WIFE WHO HAVE STATED HAVING SEEN SUCH AN OBJECT, DURING RECENT
DAYS.
WEATHER AT 1-23E FOR THIS AREA WAS SCATTERED CLOUDS AT 2200 FEET, VISBY 
10 MILES.
