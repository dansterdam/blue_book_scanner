"egg-shaped disc", and moved with fast jerky motions from one point to another, remaining within a generally oval area some 30 degrees wide. Mr. Diserly was at that time located 300 south and 300 west on the county grid system, in which roads one mile apart are given numbers by the hundreds; he was therefore two miles south and three miles west of the 0,0 point, which is in the city near its center.
Mr. Diserly arrived about five minutes after the call came in, and when he did arrive, the lights were overhead and moving south as a group, slowly; he decided to follow them. He drove south on 360 west (Malfalfa Road) to the intersection of 300 west and 225 south, where he parked and turned his headlights off. He got out of the car and watched the lights in the sky for perhaps twenty minutes, the lights having moved straight south to an elevation of some 30 to 40 degrees.
At this point the three ladies drove by and recognized the car of Mr. Diserly, thinking he was in trouble they pulled over and called to him, asking what he was doing. Diserly said he was watching "the objects in the sky," which the ladies had not yet seen. The ladies turned their headlights off and got out to watch, too.
The lights at this time (about 2230) were about 20 degrees up from the horizon, just over some woods, and were moving back and forth through an arc of perhaps 30 degrees, an oval pattern with the north-south dimension about one-third of the width. The pattern of movement within this area consisted of rapid dirtings and "chasing" motions; at one point, one witness said two of the spots stopped, and became narrow with rays of light extending upward from them, while the left remained stationary in the normal shape, and two others to the right went around each other in circles.
