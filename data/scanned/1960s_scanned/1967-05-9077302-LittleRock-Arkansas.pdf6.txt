The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text output from the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. Place a "X" on the compass where you lost sight of the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
