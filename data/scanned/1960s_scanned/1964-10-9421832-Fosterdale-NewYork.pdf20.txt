TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

UFO REPORT - 10/1/64
WITNESS: (name redacted)
OCCUPATION: Chemical Firm Superintendent 
LOCATION: Sylvester Parking Lot, Leverett, Massachusetts
DATE: 1 October 1964
SIGHTING: (name redacted) and some friends had just returned from lunch and were sitting in the car on the Sylvester Parking Lot. As they were leaving, he thought he saw a large, dark object in the sky. At first he thought it was a plane, but as he got closer it was clearly something else. The object was hovering at an estimated altitude of 500-600 feet. It was silver-gray in color, disc-shaped, and about 35-40 feet in diameter. The object was motionless for about 3-4 minutes, then it shot straight up and disappeared from view. 
EVALUATION: This is one witness that I know very well as he is my brother-in-law. The object observed appears to be a good case of a disc-shaped UFO that was observed at close range. The description is similar to the typical disc-shaped objects reported. The size and distance estimated appear to be reasonable. The rapid vertical departure is also typical.
