The image contains two sketches. The top sketch is a compass rose diagram, which appears to be used to indicate the direction of a phenomenon that was observed. The bottom sketches depict a person standing on a road with mountains or hills in the background, as well as a separate landscape image.

GA. YOU'RE LOOKING YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS SIGHTED. ALSO PLACE A '1' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE OBJECT MOVED.

1. THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A '1' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST OBSERVED. CONNECT THE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO SHOW THE PATH OF MOVEMENT. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT. IF THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAGING, REFER TO A SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS SECTION.
