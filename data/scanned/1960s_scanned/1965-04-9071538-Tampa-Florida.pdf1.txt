11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS : Our being 31,000 feet, looking north at 135 degrees, we sighted two bright objects appearing as stars but moving at high rate. They appeared to be travelling about 30 degrees per minute and were at an extremely high altitude. They soon faded from view. This is probably satellite phenomenon and not unusual.
