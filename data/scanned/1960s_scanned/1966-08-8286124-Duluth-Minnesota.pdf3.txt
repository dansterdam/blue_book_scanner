The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing a conversation between Lt. Stoecker, who was with the 29th Air Division in Duluth, Minnesota, and an unnamed person about UFO sightings in the Duluth area. The text explains that the local air force base has limited information about the sightings, as they only have records of aircraft taking off from the airport. The document also mentions that the initial report of a TWIX it (a type of teletype message) was reported, but Lt. Stoecker said he had no record of any talking off from the Duluth Air Force Base during the time of the particular sightings.
