SITE:

At 0050 the evening, I sighted a strange object flying at about 10,000 feet. The object was moving in a southeast to northwest direction.

This object was colored a person or white, and gave off no apparent light. As it passed, either conventional or jet, would have made some sound.
This object had no apparent red or green running lights. Only the constant red or green running lights.

The circumstances for this sighting are as follows: I was walking in a northerly direction from the college when this object came into my view. It moved at a speed more than fifteen to twenty seconds.

Any additional information on this object will be sent to you or reported.
