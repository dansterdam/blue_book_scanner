WESTERN WYOMING COMMUNITY COLLEGE

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

Enclosed are photos and a letter that I received when I sent a UFO report to the University. They failed to return my report and I fail to see why, if it were not to be handledbyour Division. They also mentioned the witness and signed a "waiver" and also asked them a witness. The witness also wrote a report.

I have the negatives so these photos plus the original report they returned but failed to mention they had the photos and the witness and the original negatives, reports and other items is they will be examined and the person who is responsible for losing it even if the Commission at so was writing a report they could have examined some easily as I think it said well that "A thing worth doing is worth doing well."

and another person observed three UFO's in a space of one hour in a space which was close enough to give an image that could be photographed. The photos are on kodochrome color film (green being so). The spectrum of the light could be studied by us or filters. I believe this only worthy because they showed two people are also able cary my photography as legitimate. (They saw me take the pictures as they rushed.) I think this meets a criteria legal set forth by Hynek in his Popular Photography article.

I have not had any previous significant experience so I am only able to say they object looked like nothing I've seen before in the sky at night. I am willing to admit it.
