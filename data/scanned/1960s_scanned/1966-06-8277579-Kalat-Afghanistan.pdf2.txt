Kingdom of Afghanistan
Province of Kabul
City of Kabul
American Embassy

Before me, Charles L. Darby, Vice Consul of the United States of America at the United States of America Embassy, personally appeared who, being duly sworn, deposed and says as follows:

1. My name is [redacted], who, being duly sworn, deposed and says as follows:
2. I am a Foreign Service Officer of the United States of America presently assigned as [redacted] at the American Embassy.
3. Because I was requested on the night of June 10, 1966, and the morning of June 11, 1966, to drive from Kabul to Kalat, Afghanistan, accompanied by Patrick Doyer, ROCCIO of the Marine Security Guard, American Embassy, Kabul, to investigate a reported sighting of an unidentified flying object.
4. We left Kabul at approximately 10:30 pm on June 10, 1966, and drove directly to Mukkur, Afghanistan. We reached Mukkur at about 2:15 AM.
5. At about 3:00 AM W/Sgt. Doyer had an intestinal attack and asked that we return to Kabul, which we did, arriving at the American Embassy at about 5:15 AM.
6. At the American Embassy W/Sgt. Doyer was checked by the medical officer and appeared to be an extremely bright star very low on the horizon. It appeared to be an extremely bright star with rapid gyrations and about the size of a car headlight. I asked it to look at the object, but it did not respond. Stating that it was probably just a star, I had to look at the object, stating that it was definitely not a star and that it appeared to be a mechanical device in the air, hovering and performing maneuvers. I watched the object for a few minutes and assured that it was moving, but not in any pattern. It seemed to move in a random fashion, sometimes hovering, sometimes moving about a central point, moving horizontally and vertically as described in the following figure.
