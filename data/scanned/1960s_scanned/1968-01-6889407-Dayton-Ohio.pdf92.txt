The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document describing a UFO sighting.

On the evening of January 17, at around 9:30 PM, the witness saw two bright lights and a car over the Ohio Beach area. The car and lights then disappeared behind the trees, and the witness then saw them reappear and fly away very rapidly. The object seemed to be hovering and then took off at a high rate of speed. The witness reported being very excited and unsettled by the incident and had a difficult time sleeping afterward.
