The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with handwritten text at the top that says "18 Jan 67 (hot I edit3 apryor)". The bottom portion of the page contains some text-like patterns that could be related to some kind of analysis or documentation, but there is no clear photograph present in this image.
