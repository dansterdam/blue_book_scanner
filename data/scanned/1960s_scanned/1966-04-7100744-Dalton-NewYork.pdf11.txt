The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a letter from a government agency, likely Project Blue Book, responding to a sighting report submitted by a civilian.

The text in the document is as follows:

PTD (TSBD)
Wright-patterson AFB, Ohio 45433
9 June 1966

Dalton, New York 14836

Dear Sir,

Reference your recent unidentified flying object sighting. The information in your letter of 9 April 1966 is not sufficient for evaluation. Request you complete the attached AFD Form 164 and return it.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
