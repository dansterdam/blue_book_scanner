20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" over the path or "spot" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course of the sighting.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? Please explain.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and estimate how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this test, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw.
