Dear Senator Keating:

This is in response to your inquiry in behalf of your constituent concerning unidentified flying objects (UFOB).

With regard to the truth to allegations that the Air Force has a secret documentation of its past studies of UFOBS, we must state categorically that this is not the case. The Air Force has made public all data and information concerning UFOB problems including negative case findings. There are no secret files or secret procedures which are also used in the evaluation of UFOB problems and reports.

The Air Force does not have the resources and facilities to make an exhaustive and conclusive investigation of every UFOB report. However, we do accept valid reports of UFOBS from reliable observers and analyze these in order to determine, if possible, the nature of the sighting. In addition, we maintain periodic contact with major news media and other interested parties in order to evaluate public attitudes and develop procedures which are designed to obtain more complete information in a timely manner.

The United States Air Force will continue to serve as the agency responsible for the receipt, initial investigation and analysis of UFOB reports in the United States. The services of qualified scientific personnel and periodic public officials will be utilized in this process.

Sincerely,

MAJ HARR
