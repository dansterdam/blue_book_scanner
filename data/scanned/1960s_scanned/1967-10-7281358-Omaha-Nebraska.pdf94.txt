1. This replies to your request for information on your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation and photograph. Your photograph is presently being forwarded to photo experts at Wright-Patterson AFB for analysis. It is quite likely that the analysis will take several months, since our photo section experts must take time to carefully examine every detail of the photograph.
