The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a form with questions about the sighting of an unidentified object. There is a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a triangular-shaped object in the bottom portion of the page.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes - Faded and disappeared beyond the horizon.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. 
IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Completely silent - no noise at all
b. Size: Appeared to be very small portion of sky
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
Very, very small portion

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially outline trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
