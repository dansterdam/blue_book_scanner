The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which is a collection of reports on unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings investigated by the United States Air Force.

The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or survey form with questions related to a UFO sighting. The page is labeled "Page 7" and contains questions 34 and 35, which are asking for the date the questionnaire was completed and for any additional information the witness felt was pertinent to their sighting but not adequately covered in the specific questions.
