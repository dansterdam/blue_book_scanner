There is no photograph or image present in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. However, I have produced an output of all the text found in the document:

The object was not sighted for a long period of time since it was several miles away. It appeared to be about the size of a small airplane, very bright(which worried some deer hunters in the area) and It gave the appearance of rotating as it moved along at a steady rate of speed and at a fairly good altitude, say 2-3000 feet. It changed course several times, once making a sharp right turn. It gradually slowed down and disappeared from view.
