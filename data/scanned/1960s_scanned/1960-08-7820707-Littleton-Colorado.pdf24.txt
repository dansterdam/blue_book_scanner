Discoverer XIV Goes Into Orbit
1 Missed Explodes After Launch; 
2 Others Fired Successfully

WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 - The Discoverer XIV satellite, carrying a man-made recovery capsule, was launched into polar orbit yesterday on the west coast. Although the recovery capsule failed to eject, the satellite itself was placed in a successful orbit.

The satellite, riding on a Thor-Agena rocket, was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., at 3:17 p.m. (EST).

The firing of Discoverer XIV came two days after the unsuccessful launching of Discoverer XIII, which was intended to be the first American satellite to recover a man-made object from space. The Discoverer XIII capsule failed to eject properly.

The Discoverer XIV satellite, like its predecessor, is part of the Air Force's Discoverer program, designed to develop equipment and techniques for satellite recovery. The ultimate aim is to recover film and other material from satellites for study without the need for them to return to earth.

Echo Gains In Altitude After TV Demonstrations
WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 - The Echo I balloon satellite, used for communication experiments and television demonstrations, has gained in altitude since its launching.

The communications satellite, launched Aug. 12, 1960, continues to circle the earth at an average altitude of about 1,000 miles - some 50 miles higher than originally planned. This altitude change is being studied by scientists.
