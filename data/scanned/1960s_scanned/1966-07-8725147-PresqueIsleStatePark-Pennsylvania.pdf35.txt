The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The image does not contain any photographs, it only shows the title "REPORT FROM CAPTAIN METER (NIAGARA FALLS AFD)".

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

REPORT FROM CAPTAIN METER
(NIAGARA FALLS AFD)
