Dear [redacted],
Reference your latest correspondence of August 3, 1967. We are still unable to reach a definite conclusion on your observation because the description you submitted could be that of a hot air balloon. Many individuals have not been able to determine whether one was in the area at that time.

The form you completed is a copy of an official Air Force document and your submission of information was quite satisfactory. Before reaching a definite conclusion, we recommend you contact the investigator to collect additional data. It is impossible to reach a conclusive determination based on the information provided.

The base investigator is in a better position to collect additional data and resolve this matter satisfactorily. Any further investigation would be necessary to support or disprove this observation. However, it is necessary to report that you are unsatisfied with our present policy; however, if you desire to continue the investigation, the investigator at Stewart AFB will be available.

Sincerely,
BARRETT H. YOUNG
Lt Colonel, USAF
