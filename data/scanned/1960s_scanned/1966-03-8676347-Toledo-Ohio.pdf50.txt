REF :

Enclosed for the use of the appropriate U.S. Government office (presumably the Department of the Air Force) is a report regarding a flying object sighted at Maputo. According to the report, the UFO was relatively stationary for several hours during the night near Maputo. The three witnesses, including a newspaper reporter and a local artist in the town of Maputo, described the sighting. According to the article, the UFO was relatively stationary for several hours during the night near Maputo. The three witnesses, including a newspaper reporter and a local artist in the town of Maputo, described the sighting. The artist was able to sketch the UFO as it appeared from the closeup position of observation, and c) the UFO as it appeared to the artist from Maputo.

Concern is expressed about government censorship, and the naming of witnesses. We doubt the accuracy of the reports and artist's observations. Other details and more early reports of UFOs in Mozambique have appeared two or three times during the past year or two.
