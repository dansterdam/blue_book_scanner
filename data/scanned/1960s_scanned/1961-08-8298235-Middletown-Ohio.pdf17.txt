Gentlemen:

During the past two weeks I have been visually observing an object in the sky. This object appears to be a satellite and has been visible to me all this time. I am able to determine that it takes about twenty-four hours for it to orbit, and that it travels in a southeasterly direction. This course was followed the night of August 15, just as it has on succeeding nights, and each time it disappears from view after about twenty-four hours.

I do not know if you have any information as to hearing of a satellite being put in orbit that would take this long to orbit. Also, if it takes twenty-four hours to orbit, is it possible that this is some satellite that has been around for a while and is at this altitude, it must be something very large, because it appears about as bright as a second magnitude star.

I wonder if you have any information as to what it is. If so I hope you will let me know.

Yours Truly,
