Following is a description of what he observed as he related it to me:

At approximately 11:00 P.M. he sighted a large reddish light at about 35 degrees from horizontal at a point due north. The object was traveling eastward at a very slow speed and what appeared to be a low altitude. The large light did not flicker but changed in intensity from a pale glow to as bright as the brightest star, pulsating in intensity. The object continued eastward for a short but unknown period of time. When it was at approximately 150 from horizontal, it stopped moving and remained motionless for more than a minute. It then began moving westward and passed over the observer at approximately 70Â° from horizontal. At no time were individual pulsations of light observed, only a large reddish light which was circular in shape. There appeared to be no periodic pulsation of light intensity, but there was a definite change in brightness going slowly from dim to bright and back again. The size of the light was compared as slightly smaller in size than the moon. There was absolutely no sound connected with the object. The object continued westward and disappeared from sight, not from view.
