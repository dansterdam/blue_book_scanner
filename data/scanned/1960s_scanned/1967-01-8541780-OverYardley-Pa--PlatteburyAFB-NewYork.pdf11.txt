Wematerial that this report by at about 2:00 a.m on 8 JAnuary 1967 and discussed with Lt. JONES was an unusual light observed in the sky over Yardley, Pennsylvania by one of the observers. He stated that the light was first observed to the west of Yardley, PA and was moving in a northeasterly direction rapidly. The light was described as having a pulsing or flashing appearance and was similar to a meteor but was much slower in speed and appeared lower in the sky. The observers followed the light as it moved across the sky and it eventually disappeared from sight to the northeast. Both GUTHRIE and the observers were unable to determine the exact nature of the light and no conclusions were reached by them. GUTHRIE stated that the observers appeared to be sincere and did not notice any evidence that they might be fabricating or exaggerating the report. It appeared to be a valid report of an unusual phenomenon observed in the night sky.
