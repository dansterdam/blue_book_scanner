PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 9 Oct 60
2. LOCATION: E of Misawa AB, Japan
3. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
4. SOURCE: Military
5. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
9. COURSE: Not available
11. COMMENTS: Observations indicate that object was a meteorlogical balloon. The radiant color of the object, close to being lost in the twilight, together with the apparent motion, supports this conclusion. The difficulty (normal) of determining the size of light sources is the major factor against being completely definite.
