Object buzzes car
We are indebted to Mrs. Charlotte for the following account from the diary of the Reverend Melvin J. Parsons:
"On the following Sunday (June 29), while he was driving home from Lancaster, at about 8:00 P.M., he noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of him. This light came closer and seemed to be hovering over the road. As the Reverend Parsons approached, the object suddenly darted up and down and from side to side, just above his car. It appeared to be pacing his car and was no more than 30-40 feet off the ground. It cast a white beam of light down on the car. The Reverend Parsons said the object was about 30 feet in diameter and seemed to have a red-orange center with a bright white light around the outside. He estimated it was hovering 50-60 feet above the road.
"As the Reverend Parsons watched, the object suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from sight. The entire incident lasted about a minute and a half. Afterward, the Reverend Parsons said his car motor seemed to be affected.
"A.C. Mancine, a newspaperman, said on Thursday night, June 25, while driving on Highway 521 near Lancaster, he saw a bright light flash across the sky. It moved vertically down, hovered and then shot straight up and disappeared. Mancine said he notified the local sheriff's office, but no one else reported seeing the object."
