14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
YES - Blinked OUT

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) YES No Don't Know If you answered YES, then tell what:
APPEARED TO BE BEHIND A SMALL DARK CLOUD

16. Did the object move in front of or behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) YES No Don't Know If you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Shape - OVAL
b. Color - MIDDLE-ORANGE
c. Size - 5-6 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or coin's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the width of the match head. If you had this object at the time, what would have been the match head's angle?
TIMES THE SIZE OF THE MATCH HEAD

19. Draw a sketch that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object, such as wings, projections, etc., and especially show the direction the object was moving.
