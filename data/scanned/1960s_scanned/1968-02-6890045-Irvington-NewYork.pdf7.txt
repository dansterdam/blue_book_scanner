Analysis at the U. S. Air Force Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, concluded that an object which glimmered no earlier than mid-February was a portion of the unmanned Apollo 5 spacecraft launched from Cape Kennedy on January 22, 1968.

Apollo 5 was one of a series of test launches being conducted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in preparation for a manned lunar mission. 

Reports in the South American press described a strange, 125-pound metallic object which produced three loud, sonic-boom-like explosions as it came down in the Colombian province of Meta on February 12.

Orbital analysts at ADC had predicted that the descent stage of the Apollo lunar module would decay on February 12 within plus or minus five minutes of 17:51 Greenwich Mean Time (10:51 a.m. EST). The north to south track over Mexico and the Caribbean Sea would have carried the object to the Colombian impact area.

This evaluation was provided by the 1st Aerospace Control Squadron, 9th Aerospace Defense Division, ADC, which operates the Space Defense Center in the North American Air Defense Command's Cheyenne Mountain complex near Colorado Springs.

The Space Defense Center is the command post for a global network of electronic and optical sensors operated by the ADC Aerospace Defense Division to detect, identify and track earth-orbiting satellites.
