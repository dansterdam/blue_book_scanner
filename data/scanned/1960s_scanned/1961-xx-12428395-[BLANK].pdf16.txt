facts that Major Keyhoe was behind previous efforts which resulted in Congressional briefings during August 1958 and July 1960; that present NICAP leadership charges to write to their Congressmen and request that there be a hearing on UFO's and that Major Keyhoe has, on his many television and radio appearances, spoken out for Congress - 
5. It was indicated that Congressman Joseph E. Karth, Minnesota, will be the chairman at the hearing. The hearing will last approximately five days for testimony of witnesses and the last day for an executive session. The Air Force will be required to provide witnesses, and I understand Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the Air Force's consultant, and Major Friend is the project consultant and Major Friend is the present chief of the Aerial Phenomena Branch.
6. Mr. Hines indicated he was favorably impressed with our handling of the Dewitt, Michigan case and felt that further assistance which he might need in preparing for the hearing. He also indicated that it was designed to acquaint Congressman Karth prior to the hearing, a view with which Mr. Hines readily concurred.
