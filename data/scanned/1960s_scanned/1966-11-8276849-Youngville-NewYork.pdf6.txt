The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might account for the sighting:
Intersection of Y-24 and Y-35 is almost directly overhead. TSDB-1 GHIB @ 1113Z-53 

Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
Y-24 would appear to run general toward the east (Montauk) from the point of sighting. Any T-33 jet-fighter could have flown over this area southwards at 33,000 feet and therefore appear strange. Also it is quite possible that some form of lights (chandelier) would show that would seem lights but were not.

Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs:
None
