Reference the attached letter from___________________ requesting information concerning the USAF Air Force unidentified observations. The observation of August 1965 is very similar to an observation of an unidentified object or the HILSA, 9104 second observation. The altitude and the noise are all characteristic of this type of observation. The observation could be caused by supersonic operating equipment. The observation would be caused by the aircraft at high altitude as Mr Haberman stated.
