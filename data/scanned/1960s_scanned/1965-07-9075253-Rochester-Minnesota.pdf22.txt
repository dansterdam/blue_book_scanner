There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document, containing various sketches and instructions related to documenting UFO sightings.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line where the object was when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling in. There were exactly 3 objects and they were arranged roughly in a triangular shape about 90 units apart. All originated from the same general area.
