Brand New Saucers

Anyone who thinks General Motors is the only outfit might to consider the company that manufactures all those flying saucers. Now there's a whopping business.

Saucers come in all sizes and designs as people in southern Michigan, who sighted some the other night, will attest. There's the familiar glow model which discreetly camouflages itself as a star. There's the distinctive hovering model equipped with a variety of flashing lights. Then there's the sports model that literally can disappear in a flash. (Racing stripe options:)

While last year's saucers won wide response from outlines, the new 1966 models are streamlined and sleeker than ever, their greatest year ever.

Stan McFadden, a Washtenaw county, Mich. sheriff's deputy, saw a saucer one night just a few weeks ago. "I couldn't believe it," Frank Mannor of Dexter, Mich. said, "It wasn't like the pictures of a flying saucer and it had a coral-like glow. He added that it was pear-shaped and had a porthole. Obviously, Mr. Mannor was viewing the donut-shaped model with twin nuclear engines.)

Of course, there are some who won't believe Mr. Mannor or Deputy McFadden. Even pictures of these dooke foreign craft get the push-pushsh. But those who appreciate a good machine know that somewhere in space there's a giant assembly line where thousands of little green men in safety shoes are pounding and welding, wiring and painting. 

Now if someone would just catch the license number of one of those saucers--maybe DXT could send a franchise.
