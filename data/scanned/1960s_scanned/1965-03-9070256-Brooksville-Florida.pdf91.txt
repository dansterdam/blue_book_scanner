The image does not contain any photographs. It shows two labeled exhibits, "Exhibit G - Japanese stencil tissue" and "Exhibit G - Speed-O-Print stencil tissue", along with some text below the exhibits describing the image. The text states that the "photo-micrography" from the Institute demonstrates that the tissue samples are similar, but cannot be conclusive as they have not been subjected to detailed analysis.

EXHIBIT G
Japanese stencil tissue
EXHIBIT G 
Speed-O-Print stencil tissue

It is my opinion that the photo-micrograph from the Institute demonstrates that the two samples are quite similar in character. However, this observation cannot be considered conclusive, since the samples have not been subjected to detailed physical and chemical analysis. Any conclusion as to the identity of the materials should await the results of such analysis.
