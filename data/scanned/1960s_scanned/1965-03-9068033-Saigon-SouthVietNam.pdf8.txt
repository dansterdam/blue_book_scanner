Dear Captain Fomerly,

Reference your letter of 15 Mar 1965 requesting an evaluation of a photograph which you have taken. The object in the lower left hand corner of the photograph appears to be a portion of the aircraft from which the photograph was taken. I regret that I cannot make any evaluation without the original negative/negatives and camera data such as type of camera, lens settings, focal length etc. 

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR
Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
