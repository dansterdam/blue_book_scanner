The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, containing a handwritten response to the question "Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting."

The handwritten text states: "A objeto was a line passing Christianburg & New Lesllie."
