REQUEST FOR UFO INFORMATION

2. Reference your letter of 15 July 1963. Please excuse the delay in replying.

3. We have reproduced a copy of the 29 February 1957 sighting from TPR: Parts Defects, for you. A copy of the file was sent to you on 6 November 1963, however, the attached case also includes material on this incident.

4. Enclosed is a copy of our evaluation card for a sighting from Galion AFS, Mansfield, Ohio, on 15 August 1963. Three of the four observers were airman controllers, and they all estimated that the "object" was sight to be an unconventional light.

5. We also have a very interesting case for the late evening of 19 August 1963. The encounter (apparently three very capable and reliable people) sighted a large triangular object that covered a considerable area and made a roaring noise. There was a strong inversion that night, and the observers could see the moon and stars, however, the moon should have been visible and in roughly the same position as the object. We would appreciate your comments on this case.

6. Incidentally, we do not know anything about the decay of any UFO sightings over a period encompassing in June and early July 1963. Apparently, this decay involves 23 films, for which polar patterns. Since it apparently involves 23 films, we wonder if you might be interested.
