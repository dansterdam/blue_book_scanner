 UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA OBSERVED OVER MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
 REPORT BY: RONALD W. WILSON
 DATE OF OBSERVATION: JUNE 7, 1967
 LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
 TIME OF OBSERVATION: 0100 HOURS
 REPORTING AGENCY: PROJECT BLUE BOOK, U.S. AIR FORCE
 On June 7, 1967, at approximately 0100 hours, a male witness (name withheld) reported observing an unidentified aerial object over the city of Manchester, New Hampshire. The witness stated that he was outside his residence when he noticed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be maneuvering in an unusual manner. He immediately called the local police department to report the sighting.
 Officers from the Manchester Police Department responded to the scene and were also able to observe the unidentified object. Attempts were made to photograph the phenomenon, but the resulting images were blurred and of poor quality.
 The object was described as disc-shaped, with a bright white light at the center. It appeared to hover and perform rapid, erratic movements before accelerating and disappearing from view.
 This incident was investigated by Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects. After reviewing the witness accounts and the limited photographic evidence, the case was classified as "unidentified" due to the lack of conclusive information.
 No further details are available regarding this incident. The investigation did not yield any clear explanation for the observed aerial phenomenon.
