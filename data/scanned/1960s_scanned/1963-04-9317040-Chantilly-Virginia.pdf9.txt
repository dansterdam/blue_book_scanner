24. Date you completed this questionnaire: 3 april 1963

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Flying objects appeared in the sky about 8:15 p.m. on the night of February 13, 1963. There were about 6 objects in a triangular formation. They were moving in a southwest to northeast direction and were in sight for about 2 minutes. They appeared to be elliptical in shape and white in color with a pulsating glow. The objects were larger than a normal aircraft and moved in an erratic manner, making sharp turns. They appeared to have a bluish or green colored exhaust or flame coming from the rear as they moved along. They disappeared from sight rapidly and gave no indication of the source or destination. I felt they were not aircraft, experimental rockets, or other known objects. They may have been some type of unidentified flying objects.
