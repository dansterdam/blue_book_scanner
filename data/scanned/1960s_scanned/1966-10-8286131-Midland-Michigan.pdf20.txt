The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document from the Project Blue Book UFO investigation. To act as an OCR system and extract the text, here is the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Just materially, but behind several trees.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    YES    No   Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    YES    chemical    No    Don't Know   IF you answered YES, then tell what (CHEMICAL VAPOR?)

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound    NOTHING NOTICEABLE 
b. Color    DULL LIGHT WHITE

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? ABOUT 1/2 OF 1/3 OF SIZE.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. (DRAWING SHOWN)
