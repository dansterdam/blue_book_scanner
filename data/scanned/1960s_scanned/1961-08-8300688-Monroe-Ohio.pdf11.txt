The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

As per your request, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

The object went down over the horizon.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe, in your own words, a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The object looked very much like a star very bright and shiny at first but as it was passing over it got larger and looked like the shape of Echo and it moved across the sky very fast. We know that it was not Echo because it was not blinking lights on it like Echo has.
