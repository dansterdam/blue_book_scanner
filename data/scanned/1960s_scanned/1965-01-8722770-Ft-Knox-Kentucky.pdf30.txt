Transcribed text from the document:

"An Irwindale, California observed a light-colored object cross the sky on January 13th, 1965 at about 6:30 p.m. It was visible for about 2-3 minutes and was observed to make several abrupt changes in direction and speed. It appeared to be shaped like a saucer and had a glowing or luminous appearance. It rapidly changed directions several times during the observation period. The witness felt this was not an aircraft, satellite, or any known object that could be readily identified."
