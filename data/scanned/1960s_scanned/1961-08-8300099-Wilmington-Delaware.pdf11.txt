Dear Sirs:

We would like to report the sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object. On the night of Friday, August 25, 1961, at about 8:00 P. M. EDT, we sighted a bright object in the West-Northwest section of the sky. It was a little bit lower in altitude than Arcturus was and it was about 3 or 4 times the difference in altitude of the two bodies, so the west. (Since it was too light for Arcturus to be easily seen, the position of Arcturus is approximate.)

It looked like a bubble with a orange crescent (Probably the reflection of the sun).

The preceding paragraph described the object as seen through a 6" reflecting telescope at 40 power. All of the following was observed:

At about 8:07 P. M. it exploded. Without visual aid, "the object seemed to explode, shooting out into many pieces, making a small amount of what appeared to be smoke. The exploded objects (with the naked eye) appeared to be still. They gradually faded out and were invisible after about 10 minutes. The explosion itself was not seen through the telescope as we were trying to take a picture through the telescope at the time.

If it is possible for you to give us a positive explanation of this, please do so.

Very truly yours,

[Redacted]

P. S. The pictures did not turn out due to insufficient light.
