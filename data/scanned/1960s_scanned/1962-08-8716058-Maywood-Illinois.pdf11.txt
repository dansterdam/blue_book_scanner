G.S.C. Comm[ent] form Evanston 4/13
My name is ------------
This is an eye witness report of an unusual sighting near my home at ------------, Maywood, Illinois on September 14, 1962.
At about 7:30 p.m. this evening I was looking out the kitchen window facing west and noticed an unusual light in the sky. It seemed to be a bright round light or object hovering in the sky. I watched it for several minutes as it seemed to change in shape and brightness. At first it appeared quite round and bright, then seemed to elongate and become dimmer, only to regain its round bright appearance. It was not blinking or moving rapidly, but hovering or remaining stationary. After watching it for several minutes, it suddenly extinguished and disappeared from sight. There was a clear sky at the time with a few scattered clouds.
I am a former radio operator (amateur) and have had some experience in observing the night sky and heavenly bodies. This object was unlike anything I have seen before and I am at a loss to explain what it could have been. I felt it was unusual enough to report to your office as an eye witness account.
I would be glad to discuss this further with you or provide any additional details if required.
Sincerely,
--------
