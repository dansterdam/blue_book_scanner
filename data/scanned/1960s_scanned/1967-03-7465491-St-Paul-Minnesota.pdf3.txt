To: Major Bert Johnson
From: Captain Walter W. Whiston
Subject: Reported Sighting of U.F.O. on March 22, 1967

"A high rate of speed," said he could see red and green lights on the object in addition to the bright white lights. They also said the light seemed to be self-contained and there was no light on the ground.

I believe that all of these parties observed a light, whether this light was a reflection, a mirage, or an actual object I am unable to say. If you have any further information about this I would be glad to give it to these people; I feel that it should be reported to you.
