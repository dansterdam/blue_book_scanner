The text in the document is as follows:

diverted very quickly to the area, we could probably pin this down in a mat-ter of minutes.

CORRICK: Is there any particular time of year, Colonel Tacker, when these sightings are more frequent?

COLONEL TACKER: Well, yes, Ann; in the gold spring and summertime when people are outside and are looking up. I don't imagine we had many re-ports on this Eastern seaboard in the last two or three days because most people have been inside next to their fires.

CORRICK: Is there any particular area of the country that you get greater numbers of reports...?

COLONEL TACKER: No, it seems to be rather evenly spread throughout the country.

CORRICK: I know we've had quite a few stories from our station in Cleveland, Ohio; and it seems to me they are seeing an awful lot of flying saucers in Cleveland.

COLONEL TACKER: I don't think Cleveland is more guilty than any of the other cities. Cleveland and Akron do have rather active UFO groups out there which are probably stressing again and again, and again, the fact that space travel in reverse is an accomplished fact. But I don't think we could take any one section or one city and pin it down and say that they reported more UFO's than anybody else.

DAVIS: What about phases of the moon? Does that have any effect on reports of UFO's?

COLONEL TACKER: Not noticeably, said. This has been looked into.

DAVIS: Is that right?

COLONEL TACKER: Yes, sir.
