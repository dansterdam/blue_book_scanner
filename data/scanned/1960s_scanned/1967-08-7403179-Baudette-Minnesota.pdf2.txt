The image contains a sketch or diagram showing the relative position of an object or objects in the sky. The sketch includes a horizon line, angles to indicate the elevation of the object(s) above the horizon, and a compass-style rose to indicate direction. There are instructions and questions related to the sketch, but no photographic image is present.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that shows how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the sketch where you last saw the object. Place a "C" on the sketch where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path, a "B" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
