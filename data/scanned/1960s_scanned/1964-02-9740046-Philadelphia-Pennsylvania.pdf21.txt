I wrote a response called The Incident of February 9, 1964 in Philadelphia, PA. The writer describes an incident where they observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) over Philadelphia on the evening of February 9, 1964. The object was described as a large, circular, luminous object that moved slowly across the sky, changing color from white to red. The writer indicates that the object was seen by multiple witnesses and that they attempted to notify the authorities, but were unable to reach anyone. The writer states that they are submitting this report to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.
