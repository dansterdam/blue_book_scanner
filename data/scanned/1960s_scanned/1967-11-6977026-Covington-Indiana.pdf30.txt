MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: UFO Observation, 18 Nov 67
Mrs. _____ of Covington, Indiana, area called and said a neighbor reported seeing a suspected unidentified object. Also a person that lives approximately 20 miles from there and taken pictures of an unidentified object and wanted to know if he should send them to Wright-Patterson AFB or to Chanute or to Grissom. Lt Marano informed him that the report should be made to the nearest Air Force Base. He said this was from Marshall, Illinois on 2 February 1963. _____ said he has been seeing these quite frequently now, also saw them last December and he has checked some of the radars have picked them up because Major Nichols at Chanute said their radar couldn't pick them up. On the 2nd of December, _____ also made a drawing of it. Lt Marano informed that we couldn't perform a photo analysis with the vague data that Capt Arrington had provided. _____ said he sat in his house in the living room for several hours he also filled out a bunch of forms to Chanute. Lt Marano also informed that we would need to get the original Polaroid Prints to perform such an analysis. Lt Marano said he would give them to us if he would get them back. However, the analysis would take several months to run. He said he felt that six months would be a reasonable length of time in which to perform analysis. Lt Marano said he felt that analysis could probably be done in that length of time and at the cost we would inform him of our findings. _____ said that if he didn't get them back within or at the end of six months he would write his congressman.
