I therefore presented this likely explanation at the press conference. The entire matter of a full dress press conference was most singular, so as to continue I would rather present [careful] and consistent evidence and conclusions, to a body of scientific colleagues than to a roaring path of news hounds whose chief interest appears to be in getting a quick story. I recommend once again, as I have often in the past in my capacity as scientific consultant, that the ufo phenomena which has now plagued us for a score of years and has been reasonably for countless words in newspapers during the time, should be recognized as a scientific and sociological principle of our times and studied as such by competent men in these various fields. Since the first requisition of an scientific investigation is concerned for the quality of the basic data much more attention should be paid to the immediate gathering and processing of such data, I would urge upon you to mount a more specific program designed to standardize and control the gathering of this problem. Based on a score or more of cases or evidences with which I am familiar, it seems appropriate at this time. All notes obtained were gathered all through my working tours on the three days are available in my files.
