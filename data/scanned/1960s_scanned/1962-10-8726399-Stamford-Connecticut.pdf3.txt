The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document that describes a UFO sighting.

first object started back on its North-Westerly cours while the other two parted, one going North and the
other south. After parting, (the two that had gone North and South), they seemed to disappear about 15
seconds after starting to move. The first object, I followed, still going in a North-Westerly direction un-
til it was out of view.

As I stated in the beginning of this letter, I do
not know whether or not this information is of any va
to your agency, and if not, but it may be to some other
agency such as the Air Force, would you kindly see what
they get it, if it will be of value to them.

Thank You.
