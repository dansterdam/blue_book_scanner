Conversation with Laura, Ohio on 25 August 1966
Something weird came from the East last night at 11:55 pm. Between Troy and West Milton, left a contrail and left a cloud formation. Out of this came a disc shaped object, on its side, came 3 out of cloud and watched it for eight minutes. Then a little cloud appeared and out of the front side came the orange and then all the clouds formed into one. Proceeded home and these clouds were breaking up. Thought it was approximately 5000 ft alt. His wife called his attention to it, looked like a ball, thought may be it was a aircraft breaking up. It would come and go. There was a large cloud coverage, it entered the atmosphere on 152 deg angle to the left, entered west. This thing was traveling from east to west. Came out from a cloud and then went back into a cloud. Called the Sheriff about it, don't know if he had any other reports. This cloud formation went into one main cloud and then broke up. Mr. Beck said he would be willing to fill out a form and would make a sketch of what he observed. Form 164 sent to him on 25 Aug 66.
