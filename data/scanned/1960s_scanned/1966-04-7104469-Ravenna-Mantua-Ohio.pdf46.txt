REPORT BY TELEPHONE CONVERSATION 18 Apr 66 
POLICEMAN GERALD BUCHERT, MANTUA, OHIO AREA CODE 216, phone 274
He had called Lt Weisinger, FTD Duty Officer on 17 Apr 66. I have several prints and negatives. The Lt said not to release them. Buchert explained that he was free to release them or do whatever he wish to do with them. He said the Lt didn't exactly say not to release them but said to hold onto them. Major explained to him that we would like to have the negatives so that we could blow them up. Said he would send them registered mail and asked that we send him a letter stating that we got them. Major explained that he was the officer in charge of the project. Buchert said he wasn't too sure how he should go about reporting his observation. Had a Bacon lens, with fixed lens at 14. No speed, 17 black and white, though it was fuzzy. Observed an object for 15-20 minutes. It was stopped, didn't appear to be moving, when it did move then went up and down and went back to its same position, left the right, like it was tilting, went SE, on state route 44. The pictures were taken in front of my farm. Major explained that he could do whatever he wished to do with the film as far as release goes. He could even sell them. Buchert said he would feel kind of silly. He would send them to us registered mail along with his police report. Said it wasn't a star, plane, or balloon. Like two saucers in prints. One object. Major told him we would send him an official report.
