There is no photograph present in the image provided. The image appears to be a page from a document containing text about the search for life on Mars, the possibility of life on Venus and the moon, and the study of meteors as potential sources of extraterrestrial life.

For this reason, emphasis is being given to the development of techniques for detecting the existence of life on Mars in both the U.S. and the USSR planetary exploration program. The discovery by Mariner 4 of craters on the surface of Mars, however, has little direct bearing on the problem of life there. The same can be said of the presumed absence of the Martian Canals.

Few astronomers believe that there can be any life on Venus or the moon. An exception is N. A. Kozyrev, a Soviet astronomer famous for his observations of the moon, who thinks that the high temperature of Venus refers to its ionosphere, and the surface may be in a condition to allow the development of life.

But even the moon cannot be assumed to be entirely devoid of life. Such is the opinion of A. I. Oparin, the greatest authority on such matters in the USSR. According to the TASS Agency (December 29, 1966), Oparin thinks that organic substances either alive or dead are possible on the moon.

Such an idea would probably be unacceptable in the West, but it was only 30 or 40 years ago that W. H. Pickering, an American astronomer, tried to explain various changes of tint in the moon by colonies of insects appearing and disappearing during the progress of the lunar day.

Meteorities are the only bodies of extraterrestrial origin that are available for a study in our laboratories. In connection with this, the document discusses the potential for studying meteors as a source of extraterrestrial life.
