The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing a UFO sighting.

The transcribed text from the document is as follows:

"The 12:27 AM thing, very bright white light swerved. Looked like to have made a pass over the air base at Ellington. Light was quite bright, about the size of a silver dollar, white in color. It appeared to climb very rapidly and then made a sharp right angle turn, then disappeared. No further investigation appalling..."
