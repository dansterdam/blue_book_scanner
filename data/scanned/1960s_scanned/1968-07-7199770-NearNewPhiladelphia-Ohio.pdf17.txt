IS WHAT THEY ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

It' appeared to me that it was at a fair distance when it was first seen, they claimed. Thereafter it seems to have moved in closer before it disappeared.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

It suddenly disappeared or vanished and there was no trace of it observed.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

D. WAS IT EVER SEEN IN THE VICINITY BEFORE OR AFTER THIS INCIDENT?
