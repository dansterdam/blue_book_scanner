The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

A check with weather conditions at Los Angeles International Airport indicated that the object in question was observed during a period of cooler temperatures, light precipitation, and somewhat gustier winds than normal. These meteorological factors may have contributed to the visual phenomenon.

It became quite apparent that the object observed was an atmospheric phenomenon and not a conventional aircraft. Based on the relative size of the object, its observed angular dimensions and the reported duration of visibility, the object seems to have been a weather phenomenon of some kind. There were no reports of this sighting from other sources in the area.

A check was made with the information office at USAF which is aware of the observation. The results indicate the case is considered closed and no further action is deemed necessary.
