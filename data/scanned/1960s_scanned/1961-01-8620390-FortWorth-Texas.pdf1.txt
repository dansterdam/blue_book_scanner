PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 11 JAN 62
2. LOCATION: Fort Worth, Texas
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2345
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: D Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: □ Yes
6. SOURCE: Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5-7 mins.
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
9. COURSE: Obj. rose from ground, hovered for several mins.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Round object, 8-? ft. in diameter, hovered at low altitude (20 ft.) for 5-7 mins. before rising vertically into the overcast sky. Sighted at 45° elevation, 270° azimuth. Object exhibited no apparent structure, was self-luminous, and apparently caused some ground illumination.

11. COMMENTS: It is considered that the witness's contention of having witnessed a mirror-like object appears unreliable. The description of the object and its flight characteristics are consistent with the description of the sighting as a meteor or some other natural phenomenon. This case is possibly the reflection of the moon against the overcast sky, with the ground illumination causing the witness to conclude that an object was present. This object was probably the natural phenomenon of a meteor.
