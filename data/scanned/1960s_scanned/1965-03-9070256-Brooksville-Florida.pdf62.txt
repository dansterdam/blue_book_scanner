Hernando County Sheriff's office, Brooksville, Florida, Area code 305, 796-3541

On 16 March 1965 we placed a call to Sheriff Sim L Lourman at the abovenumber. He was in a meeting at the time. We spoke to Deputy Gaines who was familiar with the Reeves's case. Gaines was out there at the same time the Air Force Office had discovered actually go out to the sighting. Newspaper quotes them as going out there, and we would like a law enforcement's opinion. Gaines said it was pretty soft earth. We told him that there were some contradictory statements. Gaines and Gaines were going out there to the sighting but they had to get a car out of the sand that was stuck. Gaines said it was hard to believe this story. He thought that Reeves was just having a day of glory. We told him that we needed a motive for this so. Gaines said he felt that they were getting their picture in the paper and got his day of glory, like some people get there day in jail he gets his in glory.
