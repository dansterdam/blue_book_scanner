Dear Sirs:
On April 26, 1965, at approx. 10:30 P.M. EST, I observed an extremely bright light in the sky, moving rapidly in a north-south direction, directly over my home. I estimated the size of the light to be 1/3 the apparent size of the moon, judging by its brilliance and the size of the moon at that time. The light seemed to change color slightly during the observation, varying from white to yellow-orange. I watched the object for about three minutes, during which time it accelerated at a terrific rate, then disappeared entirely. 
The night was clear, with good visibility. I am quite convinced that what I observed was not an airplane, satellite, star, or any other known aircraft or celestial body. The performance characteristics, size, and behavior of the object were quite unlike anything I have ever seen before. Could you please advise me as to what this might have been? I would appreciate any information you can provide.
Sincerely,
DAVID A. SCOTT
