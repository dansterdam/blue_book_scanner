ITEM
Request for UFO Information

Wisconsin Wing, Civil Air Patrol
Auxiliary of the United States Air Force
Airman's Command Division
ATTN: Lt Col Charles E. Clapp, Commander

1. Reference the attached letter from Lt Col Michael J. Amato, CAP, dated 11 March 1966, requesting investigation of UFO reports.
APR 2002 covers the reporting of UFO information to the Air Force. This regulation is what prompted this request by Lt Col Amato. 
Air Force has procedures for investigating UFO sightings.

2. Requests for information have the Marinette policeman submit his report directly to the nearest Air Force Base for action.

3. We feel it would be beneficial in identifying UFO sightings to have the information on AFRTS given in Paragraph 1 for this investigation as the procedure on Project Blue Book which describes the program on identification of flying objects is being followed.

FOR THE COMMANDER

ERIC T. CONKRIGHT, Colonel, USAF
DEPUTY FOR TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSYSTEMS
