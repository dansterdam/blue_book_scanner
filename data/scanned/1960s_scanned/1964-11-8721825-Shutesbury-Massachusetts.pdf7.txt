UFO IS SEEN
HOVERING AT
SHUTESBURY
Brilliant Orange Glow Is
Reported; Gave Lights Up
Inside of House
SHUTESBURY, MASS. - For the past 15 years, residents of this tiny rural community have been periodically seeing strange lights in the night sky, but few of them have been as spectacular as the one reported this week.
A Shutesbury resident who lives on West Street told The Union that about 6:45 p.m. Wednesday he observed a brilliant orange glow hovering about 50 to 75 feet above the ground in a field near his home.
He said the object remained stationary for about 15 minutes and then suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared within seconds.
The same man said the bright glow gave so much light inside his home that he could see clearly without turning on any interior lights.
Several other persons in the Shutesbury area reportedly saw the same object and investigators are trying to determine what it was.
Local police, state police and air force officials have all been notified of the report, but so far none of them has been able to identify the object or determine what it was.
