Analysis and Conclusions: The source of this object is not definitely known, but it was observed to have several characteristics in common with reported UFOs. Specifically it was a luminous body, it moved directionally, and remained visible for a prolonged period. HOWEVER, ITS APPEARANCE AND MOTION WERE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH KNOWN ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENA, SUCH AS A BRIGHT STAR OR PLANET. THEREFORE, IT IS PROBABLY AN ORDINARY NATURAL PHENOMENON, THOUGH THE POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING A UFO CANNOT BE COMPLETELY EXCLUDED.
