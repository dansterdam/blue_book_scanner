The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document describing the chemical properties and characteristics of methane gas.

Methane is a hydrocarbon, meaning that it is composed of hydrogen and carbon atoms. By looking at a chemical diagram, we see that it has the formula H-C-H, with one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.

Atoms of hydrogen combine with 1 atom of carbon to produce CH4 or methane. It can now be noted from its chemical formula that methane contains 5 atoms in its molecule, 4 atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of carbon.

Methane is more dense than air, and denser than common gases, making it sink to the ground as a heavy gas. It occurs due to the decaying of animal and vegetable matter in water. It is then given off, due to the decomposition reaction, bubbling through the water.

Methane is a colorless and odorless gas, insoluble in water, and burns with a blue flame. It is highly flammable and the cause of explosions in coal mines.
