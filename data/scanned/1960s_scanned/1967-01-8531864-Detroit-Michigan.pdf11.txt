34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7 Day 1 Month 1 Year 67

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. When the object was first sighted, it seemed to be heading towards me and went directly overhead. It gradually turned and went out of sight. It made no sound and there were no lights as it passed overhead. It was a greyish color and seemed to be rather large. I couldn't judge the size or distance very accurately since I had no points of reference. It generally moved smoothly but did exhibit a slight pulsating or vibrating motion, not unlike the motion of a falling leaf. It was not shaped like any known aircraft.
