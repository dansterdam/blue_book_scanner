SUBJECT: OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT
A report received from: Maine Air National Guard, South Portland, Maine
On 8 May 1963, at approximately 1255 hours EST, an unidentified object was observed by members of the Maine Air National Guard at South Portland. The object was described as a circular shape, larger than a full moon, and surrounded by a bright glow. The object appeared to be motionless, and was estimated to be at an altitude of 2,000 feet, some 10 miles off the coast, in the Atlantic Ocean area approximately 49°N 49°W.
The object was observed for about 30 minutes, after which it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight at a high speed. No noise, trail or exhaust was observed.
The observation was confirmed by three separate observers, all experienced flight personnel.
No other aircraft were known to be in the area at the time.
This sighting is classified as unexplained and merits further investigation.
