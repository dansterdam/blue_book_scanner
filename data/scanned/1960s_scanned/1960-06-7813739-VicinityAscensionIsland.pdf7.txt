SUBJ: INCIDENT REPORT: FLARE LIGHT SIGHTED DURING DATA CASSETTE RECOVERY, TEST 1802  

REF: Test 1802

During actual recovery of the data cassette on Test 1802, a bright light was sighted aboard the small recovery boat. Statements by observers who sighted the light are attached.

The undersigned was aboard ORV WHISKEY as observer and advisor for the following statements is submitted concerning my observations from the small boat at the time of sighting.

"Missile impact occurred at approximately 25/0212. The data cassette light was sighted from ORV WHISKEY at approximately 25/0115. The ORV approached to within 1 NM of the blinking light. The aircraft reported sighting the strong blinking light shortly after and orbiting the data cassette awaiting the arrival of the ORV."

"At approximately 0152 the ORV approached to within 1 NM of the blinking light." The light was gone. The small boat was launched and recovery was commenced at 25/0212. A SODAR event was coordinated with Station 12 at point of recovery.

"The SGM aboard WHISKEY was below deck maintaining communications and data cassette pickup."

"It has been established by written statements received from the A/C and visual personnel, that the aircraft did not release a flare, as light's origin was from other than test participants."
