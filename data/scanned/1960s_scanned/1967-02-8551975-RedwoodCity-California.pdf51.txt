There does not appear to be any photograph or image in this PDF file. The document seems to be a typewritten letter that describes an interview with a Mrs. [redacted] and her husband, who witnessed an unidentified flying object. The letter provides details about the incident and the reluctance of the witnesses to share much information about it. The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Kay:

Enclosed is the report of the interview I had with Mrs. [redacted] and her husband were driving along Route 7 when they sighted an unidentified object which she noticed through her windshield. Her husband did the same. The object was stationary above the highway and was very brilliant. Her husband was reluctant to say to much only that there were people piled off to the side of the road looking at the object. I pressed back on my questions to see if I could give me a different answer but he didn't. He said he had a negative effect on the UFO question though more information like a drawing but her husband was just leaving for work and I had to make it brief.

I hope this report is to your satisfaction.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
