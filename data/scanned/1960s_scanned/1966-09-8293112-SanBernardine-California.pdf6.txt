The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with a series of questions and space for handwritten responses.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something or at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):        Yes      (No)      Don't Know.        IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):        Yes      (No)      Don't Know.        IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound _____________
b. Color _____________

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the stick is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
