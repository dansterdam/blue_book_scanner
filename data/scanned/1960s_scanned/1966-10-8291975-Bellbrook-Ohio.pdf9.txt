Received telephone call from Bellbrook, Ohio on 25 Oct 66. Last night he saw a UFO at 8pm going SE. He was looking for a satellite and saw a UFO. He watched it for ten minutes. Color was red then white then blue to green. 
His neighbor saw it too. Sgt Jones asked if he would complete a FTD Form 164, he replied yes so Sgt Jones said he would send two forms, one for himself and one for his neighbor.
FTD Forms 164 were sent on 27 Oct 66.
