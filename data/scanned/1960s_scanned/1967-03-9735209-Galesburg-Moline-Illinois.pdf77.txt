GALESBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT
PRELIMINARY REPORT

CRIME: Missing - Reports Fall ing Object Incident 
VICTIM: (Name Redacted), 732 (Butler Guards), Residence Address: (Redacted), Galesburg, Illinois
BUSINESS ADDRESS: Butler Guardhouse, 25 Henderson, Galesburg, Illinois
WHERE COMMITTED: Butler Guardhouse, 25 Henderson
REPORTED BY: Galesburg Police Department
DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY: None

INVESTIGATION:
Received a call from the Butler Guardhouse that they had seen something they could not identify that had appeared in the sky and hovered over their area. This created quite a disturbance and they called to report it. When the police arrived, the object had already left, but the guards stated that it was a bright, very bright light that moved from one side of the sky to the other and would seem to make sudden stops and starts. They stated this light would cause the area to be illuminated and would seem to be bigger than any plane or star they had ever seen. They had all watched it and were positive it was not an aircraft, helicopter or any normal object but seemed to be of an unusual nature. No one was able to get any pictures of it as it moved very rapidly. The guards stated they had never seen anything like it before. The police did respond but since the object was gone, they could really not determine exactly what it was.
