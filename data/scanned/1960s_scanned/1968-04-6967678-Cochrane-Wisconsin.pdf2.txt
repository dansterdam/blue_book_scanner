More & more coming up the Hwy. 10 to 5:28 to 5:30 or there abouts.
At the Simen home & many others, this object turned around & went back almost due west, & back again toward the south, seen about 5-10 minutes by numerous witnesses over the homes, making sharp turns, saw it clearly below tree tops, just about 500 feet alt. 
Then it went up in the air rapidly, & we never saw it again after it reached the tree tops. This happened from about 5:10 to 5:20. The sky was clear & moon was out, which helped a lot to see this object against the sky. As it went up it seemed to get smaller, & disapated somewhat, but not like a burning obj. or shooting star. More like a maneuverable obj. which could be a missile or aircraft, due to it's peculiar movements & speed. I observed it from start to finish thru field glasses which makes this a more reliable sighting, GS-70 or 15 min. This happened alot of people in the area who saw the same thing, but I was the only one who got a good close look & saw it clearly under the tree tops.
