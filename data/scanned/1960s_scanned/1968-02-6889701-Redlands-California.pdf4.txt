There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

3. After discussing the entire UFO sighting with Dr. Staff I conducted a belated investigation.
4. The following UFO report is submitted in accordance with AFR 80-17. The attached UFO worksheet includes all information required by the above regulation.
5. Statements reviewed by at the Redlands Police Department. All questions asked were answered on the attached UFO worksheet. It should be noted at this time that the answers are very similar to the answers given to Dr. Staff and his associates when the same witness was interviewed by them. In addition, two articles that appeared in the local Redlands newspaper are attached.
6. Comments of the investigating officer are:
a. From all the information gathered, it would be most likely to assume that the sound heard by Dr. Staff and the dogs to bark was the mechanical noise produced by a high powered crane described in the newspaper article, dated 7 Feb 68. The team moved through the area approximately four to five blocks to the location of the sighting. In this same direction described by him, and at the identical time of the sighting.
b. As mentioned at the time of the new article dated 7 Feb 68, the indication is made that the mystery of the strange sound, seems to be satisfied by the proximity of the search and rescue team. The investigation disclosed that a light plane arrived at Redlands Airport on 10 Feb 68. The traffic patterns for light planes could cause a flight path similar to the light directions described by the witness. No unusual targets on radar during the immediate area during this period.
Based on the facts presented, the probability exists that the flight path of the light plane accompanied by the search and rescue siren caused this UFO report.
