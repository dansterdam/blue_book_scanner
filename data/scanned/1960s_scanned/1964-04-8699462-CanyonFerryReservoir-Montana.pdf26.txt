Transcribed text from the document:

TWO SAUCER LANDINGS IN CALIFORNIA: On the night of April 30th, a mysterious dome-shaped object which had landed near Route 91, reported being a gigantic aircraft about 10 miles of Bakerfield, California. Mrs. Gloria Glover, a housewife, first saw it as a water tower, but as we got closer we knew it was something else. Mrs. Biggs, her husband, and their 20-year old son watched the object for about 5 minutes while their car was moving. It then disappeared suddenly from a hilltop near when they looked up. Their car engine died and they waited two hours for it to come alive again.

Las Vegas Mystery: We are indebted to the following for about five or six minutes while watching the following: "Two women were motoring on a highway near Las Vegas, Nevada, when an unidentified flying object appeared from behind a hilltop. The object departed from the hilltop at a rapid speed in the direction of Las Vegas. About a mile or so further on, the same or a similar object was seen again. It seemed to be silvery or aluminum colored and disk or saucer-shaped in appearance. Mrs. Lorene Ayers, all of Fontana, California, told authorities they had no explanation for the object. They also stated they were not playing tricks or playing a hoax. The object was within the 'Thursday's pictures to the right' on the hilltop, just off U.S. Highway 95, near to Las Vegas."
