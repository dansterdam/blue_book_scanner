It was learned that the FAA in Lansing turned over control of flight control station on 25 June between 0300 and 0300 for a classified military operation. Roger Snowberger was the tower operator and was interviewed the following afternoon at 1500 when he came on duty.

Discussion with the tower operators James A Mackey on UFO's and the messages in the area revealed that many calls are received by the tower operators, normally explaining the observation of strange objects in the sky, some of which are said to be saucers or planets. The tower at Capitol City Airport has an unobstructed view of the entire area.

At 0200 am 15 Jun 54 Sgt Moody returned to the motel.
