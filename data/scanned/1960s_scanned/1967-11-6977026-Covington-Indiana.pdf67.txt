BE SURE TO COAT EACH PRINT

CAUTION: This process uses a caustic jelly which, if not safely handled, can cause severe injury to the eyes and skin. The jelly will stain clothes and most surfaces. Handle the print by the edges only, as contact with the jelly can stain hands. It is extremely important to keep the jelly from the face, eyes, and skin. Wear rubber gloves if possible. Avoid getting the jelly on any surface as it is extremely difficult to remove.
