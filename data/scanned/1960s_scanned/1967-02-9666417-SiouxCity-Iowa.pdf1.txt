PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE, TIME GROUP: 25 JAN 67 1730.
2. LOCATION: SIOUX CITY, IOWA.
10. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S): THREE BRIGHT DISC SHAPED OBJECTS WITH ROUND DOME.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers watched three "shiny shaped objects" for about two minutes. They were over Sioux City, Iowa. There was no sound or ground effect. They moved in a straight line and disappeared to the northeast. There was a noticeable pulsation or oscillation in the lights which prompted the reflection that this was a spectatory variation due to reflecting changing atmospheric conditions.
