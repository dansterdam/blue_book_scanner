The handwritten text describes an observation of a picture window "looking down (about 3-4 mile high) at something just behind the mountains from time about 11:50 PM to 1:00 AM PST. Object, judged to be a rather large object, seemed to be hovering with a pulsating oscillating light occasionally going out about 8-10 seconds then coming back on at once. Object hovered and moved in a peculiar manner and finally went off out of sight. From [REDACTED] to P.S.D.E.N. checked the same through telescope and spotted the object, but could not make out details because of night haze. Whatever it is or was, it was high, motionless at times, and pulsating like a bright object. It seemed to be a solid object and not a mere light or reflection. Possible, tough, that such a plastic, iridescent sphere could be an off and on pulsating reflection from the moon on the window.
