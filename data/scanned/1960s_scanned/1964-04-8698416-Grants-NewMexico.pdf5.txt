The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

1. Contacted Lt j. W. Marshall, personally at his teaching position, Thomasville School, Thomasville, Arizona at 1600 hours, Friday, 1 May 1964.

2. His camera is a KONICA, Model I, 35mm (Camera lens 1:2.0, F-40mm) made in Japan. He took the photograph during a class session with elementary students, 11 May 1964. He stated that he showed the picture to the students, but did not encourage them to discuss the object in the picture as he did not want to cause them to be alarmed or unduly frightened. The photograph is attached. (Ref: Konica cameras, f2, 35mm, 1:2, F40-14, s no: 245451).

3. It is noted that he did not mind letting the 35mm movie frame of the film, that showed the picture, be removed from the camera. The pictures were exposed on a single frame of the film (including one of the object). The pictures have a legal value and introduces the quality that any unauthorized use of the pictures would be illegal and the property control of the film and pictures rests within the control of the 4351st CCTW.

4. Regulations T.O. 00-35D-54 and item 3(1)(2) and (3) in existing directives provide instructions on the handling of unidentified photographic material and directions for personnel on man/UFO contact.

5. The observer appears to be consistent, credible, intelligent, sincere and truthful in his reporting.
