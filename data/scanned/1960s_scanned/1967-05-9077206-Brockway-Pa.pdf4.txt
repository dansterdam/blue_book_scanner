OCT 13 1967

Dear [Redacted],

This will reply to your letter of September 22, in which you requested information on your observations of an object in the sky since May, 1967.

Presently, there are over 1100 objects in orbit; over forty are visible to the naked eye.

It takes approximately ninety minutes at the minimum for satellites to make one revolution. For example, Vanguard 1 is at an approximate altitude of 2200 miles and takes about 132 minutes to make one revolution.

Satellites do not cross the same point on each revolution because the earth is rotating. The time may vary from one revolution to the next as determined by the height. For example, Echo 1 is at an approximate altitude of 1000 miles and takes about 118 minutes to make one revolution.

We feel that you have probably seen satellites.

Further satellite information can be obtained from the 1st Aerospace Squadron, Ent Air Force Base, Colorado 80912.
