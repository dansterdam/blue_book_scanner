Dear Sir:

I do not whether or not this information is of value but I do not believe that you wished any statements, satellites or objects. The phenomena I saw was extraordinary I believe.

This object appeared in the northeast and travel from the northeast toward the northwest. It was about 45 to 50 degree high in the sky and started as an object that appeared to be a jet on the distance as larger became the size, this was at 5:50 P.M. on Dec 23 1960.

After I spotted it, it traveled about 2 or 3 seconds then developed a tail then diminish while in a tear mode its original size. The white spot traveled about 3 or 4 seconds - behind this white was spots or sparks (very large) that were coming from the trail way behind the ball or white. This I estimate took about 3 or 4 seconds and ended at about 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon. At first I thought the white spot developed quickly for an explosion. I did not try to estimate the distance but possibly you can from the angle and trajectory of its flight. I hope this information may be of some value to you.

Yours truly,
Buckingham Iowa
