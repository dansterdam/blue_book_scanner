This image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains two illustrations:

1. The larger illustration is a compass-like diagram with various directional labels. This appears to be some kind of visual aid or reference for describing the orientation and movement of a reported UFO sighting.

2. The two smaller illustrations at the bottom depict a person standing in a landscape, with what appears to be a distant object or phenomenon visible in the sky.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

THE LARGER SKETCH
ILLUSTRATES THE ORIENTATION OF THE PHENOMENON WHICH APPEARED STATIONARY WHEN FIRST SIGHTED, THEN MOVED IN THE DIRECTION INDICATED BY THE ARROW. THE SMALLER SKETCH ON THE RIGHT DEPICTS THE SIGHTING AS IT APPEARED FROM THE OBSERVER'S POSITION. THE LARGER SKETCH IS USED TO PROVIDE A VISUAL REFERENCE TO THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT AND ORIENTATION OF THE PHENOMENON.
