Another "Magic" Ship?

"One evening about 9:45 p.m. July 20, 1954, Mrs. J. A. Bickmore, a West Virginia housewife, was sitting on her porch when she noticed a brilliantly lighted object in the sky to the southwest. It was descending at a 45-degree angle and moving at a moderate speed. 

Mrs. Bickmore called her husband, who came out and also observed the object. They described it as round, with flashing lights around the rim and a brilliant white light in the center. The object hovered for a few minutes, then accelerated rapidly and climbed straight up into the sky, disappearing within a few seconds.

Mrs. Bickmore said the object was silent and there was no trail. She estimated it to be about the size of a car and about 1,000 feet in the air. The duration of the sighting was about two minutes. Mrs. Bickmore said that she was amazed by what she had seen, and she and her husband discussed it at length afterward. She couldn't imagine what the object was."
