S.D. SKIES GLOW
PILOTS SPOT MYSTERY LIGHT
By JOHN PAINTER
Two Navy pilots reported seeing an unusual glowing light in the sky over San Diego last night, the Air Force radar station at Miramar said.
The pilots, on a routine training flight, said they spotted the glowing light at 7:42 P.M. Lt. Jn. Jacobs of North Island said the light appeared to be about 7,000 to 8,000 feet in the air and was stationary. 
The Air Force radar station at Miramar said the light could not be picked up on its equipment.
"The light appeared to be a steady glow, not blinking as a satellite would. We then set our instruments to see if we could track it, but it was not picked up by our equipment," a spokesman said.
Lt. Jn. Jacobs said the light appeared to be a "steady, intensely bright light" which he said was seen for about two minutes. As he flew closer to investigate, he said the light faded and disappeared.
The Air Force said it was unable to determine the source of the mysterious light.
