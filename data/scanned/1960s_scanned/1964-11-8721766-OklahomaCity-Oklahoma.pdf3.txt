There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text.

We are attaching a list of the UFO organizations and hobby clubs. We would appreciate any additions or comments regarding discontinuations of those no longer active.

Please refer to the attached information regarding evaluations such as the Focus City sighting. Information regarding evaluations by the Air Force is also available to indicate status and the press. It is good this does much to clarify reports and to eliminate doubt in the minds of some researchers. This information supplied by our office regarding the Air Force investigation policy. No further information must be released through the Air Force rather than the office of the Director of PBBO.

Your six page article is being returned with a few comments by Sgt Moody. These comments are to be used for your information and/or guidance in future articles. The following comments or points appear pertinent:

(1) The Air Force accepts only essential fact regarding life and intelligence on other planets and does not engage in speculation.
(2) Information from almost 9,000 cases indicates that unidentified flying objects exist as reports of aircraft, balloons or stars, planets, but have a multitude of "natural" explanations. The nature of these other space-objects under intelligent control. The letter of 3 Sep 47 did not state that UFOs are real, but that they have sufficient information to determine if they were visitors from outer space.
(3) We would appreciate a statement of the information in your files which indicates that they are objects of interplanetary origin.

Sincerely,
Major QUINTANILLA, Jr.
Chief, Project Blue Book
