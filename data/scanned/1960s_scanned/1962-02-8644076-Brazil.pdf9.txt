FED 20, 1962 GLENN FLIGHT (NO CASE, INFORMATION)

RECENT USAF REPORT

COLONEL GLENN SIGNED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS WHILE IN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH. HE SAW ABOUT 20 OF THEM MOVING VERY RAPIDLY AS HE WAS ORBITED AROUND THE EARTH. HE TRIED TO TAKE PICTURES OF THEM BUT THEY WERE MOVING MUCH TOO FAST.

AT THE TIME OF REENTRY, SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE GLENN TOUCHED DOWN, HIS CAPSULE WAS SEEN BY A GROUND OBSERVER ON THE WEST COAST TO HAVE A BRIGHT LUMINOUS OBJECT ALONGSIDE OF IT, MUCH LARGER THAN THE CAPSULE ITSELF. THIS OBJECT CAME TO WITHIN 50 FEET OF THE CAPSULE AND THEN SHOT AWAY AT A FANTASTIC SPEED. THE GROUND OBSERVER VERIFIED THIS IN A WRITTEN STATEMENT AND WAS JUST AS SURPRISED AT THE FIRSH SIGHTING AS GLENN WAS ON HIS.

IT IS JUST AS THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN BROKE THE HORIZON THAT THESE BRIGHT OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED. AND IT WAS NOTED THAT THEY SEEMED TO BE BRIGHT, BLUISH-WHITE IN COLOR AND OF TREMENDOUS SPEED. THEY STAYED IN VIEW FOR A MATTER OF SECONDS, 4-5 SECONDS TO BE EXACT, AND THEN THEY WERE GONE. NO SOUND ACCOMPANIED THEM, AND IT WAS JUST BARELY LIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE THEM.

THIS CONDITION WOULD FAVOR THE THEORY THAT THEY WERE NOTHING MORE THAN REFLECTIONS FROM THE SUNLIGHT AND MOISTURE IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE. HOWEVER, COLONEL GLENN STATED HE COULD SEE THE OUTLINES OF THESE OBJECTS AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF SPACE AND THEY WERE SHARPLY DEFINED. THESE WERE NOT JUST SPARKLING LIGHTS, BUT METALLIC OBJECTS.

THE MORE LIKELY THEORY ADVANCED IS THAT THEY WERE SATELLITES OR OTHER MAN-MADE OBJECTS IN ORBIT. HOWEVER, SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS ATTRIBUTED TO THEM AND WHICH WERE PROBABLY NOTED BY BOTH GLENN AND THE GROUND OBSERVER, ARE NOT IN KEEPING WITH KNOWN CHARACTERISTICS OF SATELLITES. THE FACT THAT SOME OF THEM CAME TO WITHIN 50 FEET OF THE CAPSULE, MOVED AT FANTASTIC SPEEDS, AND THEN SHOT AWAY, SEEMS TO INDICATE SOME DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE DIRECTED CONTROL.

THIS WOULD SEEM TO LEND SOME SLIGHT SUPPORT TO THE THEORY THAT THEY WERE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OF SOME KIND. OF COURSE, SINCE NO REALLY GOOD PHOTOGRAPHS WERE OBTAINED, WE MUST RELY ON THE VISUAL OBSERVATIONS OF BOTH GLENN AND THE GROUND OBSERVER. SUCH VISUAL OBSERVATIONS, WHILE CERTAINLY IMPRESSIVE, DO NOT CONSTITUTE CONCLUSIVE PROOF. THEREFORE, WE CANNOT DEFINITELY IDENTIFY WHAT GLENN AND THE GROUND OBSERVER SAW. IT IS ANOTHER VERY INTERESTING PHENOMENON FROM THE GLENN FLIGHT IS SHOWN THAT MERITS FURTHER STUDY AND INVESTIGATION.

THE ABOVE IS THE MOST CURRENT AND SUMMARY REPORT FROM THE U.S. AIR FORCE ON THIS INCIDENT. THIS WILL BE KEPT IN THE BLUE BOOK FILES FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.
