34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 9 APRIL 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: We were wondering if any similar sightings have been reported in the Tucson area, or within a reasonable distance of Tucson. As far as we can determine, we have not been able to contact anyone who has had a similar experience. The object we saw was bright, reddish-orange in color, and appeared to be very large, far larger than a conventional aircraft. It moved very slowly and silently, with no visible means of propulsion. After watching it for approximately 10 minutes, it appeared to become smaller and move away from us very rapidly. I would appreciate any information you could provide regarding this sighting, or any similar sightings in this area.
