Huge Light Buzzed Car
In New Mexico
Two days before the Zamora sighting in Socorro, New Mexico, Theresean Mrs. Marie Morrow and a friend, Ruth Ovelette and Mrs. Morrow's 5-year-old son, were driving east of Lordsburg, New Mexico, headed for Tucson. It was about 8 p.m. when the huge light buzzed their car. The light, which appeared to be 10 feet above the top of the car, was so bright "as day". The inside of the car was lighted and both Mrs. Morrow and Ruth said the object appeared to be about 10 feet, at the most, above the top of Mrs. Morrow's car. It made a "whirring" sound, and was as bright as the light of a welder's torch.
