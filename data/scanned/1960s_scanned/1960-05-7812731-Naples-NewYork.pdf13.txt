38. In your opinion, what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
Whatever was happened there seemed. Of course I have no idea what it could have been. I'm startled sure. My husband doesn't believe there are "little men from Mars" and to mind, nor do I, but I never heard or saw anything like this before whatever it was. Whatever happened to whomever it happened to I very sorry. I take this to write a letter stating the facts as I know them only.
