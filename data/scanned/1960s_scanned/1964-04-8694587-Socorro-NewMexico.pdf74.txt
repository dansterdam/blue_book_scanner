There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a typed letter dated 26 April 1968, addressed to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Chairman of the Astronomy Department at Northwestern University, from Robert A. Bieberman of Socorro, New Mexico. The letter discusses a sighting of a "saucer" in Socorro, New Mexico, and mentions that a clipping from the Dubuque Telegraph Herald was enclosed with the letter.

Dear Dr. Hynek

I may have a lead on the person you are looking for. Within a week or two after 24 April, 1964, my mother sent me a clipping from Dubuque who saw the saucer in Socorro. The clipping was from the Telegraph Herald, Dubuque, and included a picture of the individual. As I recall, the man was one of the witnesses at the time. Unfortunately, I do not know the name of the individual the clipping contained. However, I am sure that this clipping could be obtained from the Telegraph Herald in Dubuque.

Very truly yours,
(Signed)
