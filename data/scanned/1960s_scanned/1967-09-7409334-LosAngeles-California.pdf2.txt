Principal 10% Light Area Dark Area
Major 1-10% Si Al,Ca,Mg,K,Fe Al,Ca,
Minor 0.1-1% Mg,Mn Mg,Mn,Na,K

c. X-ray diffraction indicated the main crystalline constituent of the dark area to be Fe3O4.

III. CONCLUSIONS: Complete identification was not possible but it would appear that the sample is either slag or a naturally occurring material.
