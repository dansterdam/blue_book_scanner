Where he had seen the object come to a sudden stop over the road, nor may have been looking at Venus. He then proceeded to watch as the object slowly descended to the miles where he parked and watched as it just east of west, as it dimmed and brightened several times, and either went down or turned off. The time when this, according to Mr. Venus would have been between 1:15 degrees above the horizon - and would have been behind the distant tree line.

He reported that he watched the object to the northwest as it descended at an angle and disappear behind the trees in the southwest. He was in the house after it disappeared, which was, according to the witness, about 15 minutes. He estimated that the time the last motion at about 8:30. However, this time estimate may have not been the last time of sight was from a position about 2 miles south of west. At this same time, * was observing from the northwest, and remarked at one point that the object did dim and seem to go back up in the direction it had come from before it shot off to the south.

Therefore, it is possible that (A) Venus had set below the tree line in the time between 1:30, and was rising again as the object, which had moved closer to along * s line of sight. If that is the case, the object was the actual planet Venus. On the other hand, the object was about two miles offshore and 2.7 miles north of *, because that is the last known of sight cross.
