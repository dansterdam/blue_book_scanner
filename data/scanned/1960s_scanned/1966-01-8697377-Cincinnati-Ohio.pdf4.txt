There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire that appears to have been filled out.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? "It had bright points or lights, then it disappeared like a straight line, then it reappeared." 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - "no sound, silent"
b. Color - "white with center or core"

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match hand? "The match head might have covered the object."

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the objects such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. "This object looked as if it came in a straight line, there were no exhaust trails or vapor trails."
