"My sister and I saw a strange flying object last night at about 9:00 p.m. We were driving home from our jobs downtown. We were driving north on Route 8, a major highway, when my sister suddenly exclaimed, "Look at that strange object in the sky!" I glanced up and was amazed to see a large, bright, oval-shaped object hovering in the western sky. It seemed to be about 30-40 feet in diameter and was brilliant white in color, with a slightly fluorescent glow. The object was completely silent and seemed to be floating motionless in the sky. We watched it for about 2-3 minutes before it suddenly accelerated at an incredible speed and disappeared from view. It was unlike anything I have ever seen in the sky before. I am certain it was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. I have no explanation for what we saw that night. The experience was both fascinating and a little frightening. I can only describe it as a true unidentified flying object."
