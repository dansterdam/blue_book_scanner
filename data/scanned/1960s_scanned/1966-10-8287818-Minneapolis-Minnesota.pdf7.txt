Dear Sirs:

I am writing in response to a sighting of an unidentified flying object by my brother and his companion. I would like to provide you with the details of the incident, as I believe it could be of interest to your investigation.

According to my brother, the sighting occurred on October 7. The object was white in color and made no sound. It was approximately 2 to 3 feet in diameter and gave off a white light underneath. My brother stated that the object was hovering about 5 feet off the ground and that the weather was clear.

My brother described the object as metallic in appearance, with a rotating motion. He stated that it was visible for about 5 to 10 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. This is consistent with the details he provided to me.

I am forwarding this information to you in the hope that it may contribute to your investigation. If you require any additional details, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
