Dear Sir,
Here is the story people in our class saw on March 16, 1964. March 16, 1964 at 9:50 P.M. - our class was going to a basketball game in Orange, Connecticut. When coming home, five or six people in our class, including myself, saw a large, bright, flashing light in the sky. It was going very fast. We watched it for about 2-3 minutes and then it disappeared. We thought it might have been a shooting star or an airplane, but it was much larger and brighter than any airplane we had ever seen. The light flashed on and off and was a very bright white light. We have never seen anything like it before. It was very high in the sky, much higher than an airplane. We were all very excited about seeing it. We would like to know if you have had any other reports of sightings like this one. Please let us know if you have any information about what we saw.
Sincerely,
