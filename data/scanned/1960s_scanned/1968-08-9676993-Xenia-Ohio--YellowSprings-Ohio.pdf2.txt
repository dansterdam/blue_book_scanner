Transcribing the text from the document:

Its appearance? And how? The color certainly sounds very much like the moon. Then Mr. identifies it as the moon. And as for the statement they they so emphatically used this motion to prove that it was definitely not the moon, yet they do not ever explain how they could definitely tell it was not the moon. Though they keep repeating that assertion. Again, I think that autokiness is involved here.
Then, I feel that Hynek makes a very serious error when he makes the assertion that it would go very clearly to the first part of your sighting couldn't possibly have been the moon. Why not? And even if the were convinced of that, by making this statement he further conditions the witnesses and bolsters what I think was their erroneous conclusions from the observations. She is the one who kept claiming that what she and her parents saw was definitely not the moon. Because "it was moving" which is again characteristic of autokinesis. Hynek should never have stepped in and backed their conclusion. He is supposed to be a neutral fact finder, trying to elicit the facts from them, and how he has backed into a corner something that she will always say that she saw something different from the moon, and the facts are different from what she is saying.
It seemed to me like an ordinary moon in the beginning. Then it kind of toggled and appeared to be swinging. They asked about sounds, which appears to be imagining and so does the "funny odor." 
In reply to Hynek's direct question about whether it "moved across the sky," they replied "it really actually appeared to move." I have to reach the conclusion that, the only reason for believing that it was not the moon is that "well, the moon never acted like that."
