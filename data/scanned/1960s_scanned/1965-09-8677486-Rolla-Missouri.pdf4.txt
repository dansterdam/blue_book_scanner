The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

The text in the document is as follows:

1. Two objects were too high to be planes, their lights steady without blinking.
2. The red object was traveling away from the white object and
3. Could this red object be a reentering capsule of some description? What their sizes were is not clear to me
I hope you can confirm or disconfirm this information and justify their description as it seems my husband's observations.
We would be very interested to know if there is an official record of the sighting and the "reentering capsule". Or is there another more plausible explanation? Thank you.

Sincerely,
