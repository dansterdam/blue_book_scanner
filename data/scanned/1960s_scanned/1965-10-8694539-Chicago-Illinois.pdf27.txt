Hovering object in Transkei

From the Rand Daily Mail of October 22nd:
"A strange object was seen hanging in the air over Transkei this week.
The object was seen on Thursday by Mr. M. J. Comins, of Mbulane in the Middeldift district. He said he watched it for about five minutes as it hung motionless in the sky."

21 Oct 65
Transkei, Africa

A strange bright red and round object was
sighted over Transkei by many people. It
was seen over the Tuskies village area and
seen by the oncoming Boeing airliners. 
The object hovered for almost 15 minutes, 
then suddenly shot off at an incredible
speed and then vanished out of sight. There 
was no sound and no trail. We were all
amazed and excited. I was able to take a
look at it but it disappeared very quickly.
There was no noise, and the sighting lasted 
for about 15 minutes before it took off.
