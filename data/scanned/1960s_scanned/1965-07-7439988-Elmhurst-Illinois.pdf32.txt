In the districts of Barroca, Catulre 
and Camareira, Brazil, many watched a 
brightly lit object travelling rapidly 
across the sky in Belo Horizonte state. The object flew slowly at first, then rapidly 
flew away to the left, leaving a yellow, blue and orange tail behind it. It remained in sight 
for 10 minutes. One of the witnesses was 
a lawyer, Dr. Wilson, who saw it: Date: 
27 July.
