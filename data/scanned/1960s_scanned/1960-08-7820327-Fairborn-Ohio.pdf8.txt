The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with a set of upward-pointing lines above it, suggesting some kind of object above the horizon. The second sketch shows a road stretching into the distance, with buildings or trees on either side.

In terms of the text in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve where the object first came into view. Place a "B" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this.
