35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific police questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The object which we observed appeared to be triangular in shape. It was dark in color, seemed very large in size. The object was hovering at an estimated altitude of 5100 feet and maintaing a constant heading - No apparent means of propulsion could be observed.

We had no way of estimating the true size of this object. It seemed very massive and was observed for a period of 7 to 10 minutes. While maintaining constant heading and altitude, it suddenly accelerated to a tremendous velocity and disappeared from sight over the horizon.

I suggest that this incident be given further investigation. It is my belief that the object observed was not a conventional aircraft, but an Unidentified Flying Object of unusual design and performance characteristics. I do not have an explanation for what we observed that night. I can only state the facts as they appeared to us. I hope this information will be of assistance in your investigation of this sighting.
