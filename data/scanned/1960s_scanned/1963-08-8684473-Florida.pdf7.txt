Dear Doctor,

Here is a report of a UFO sighting that occurred on 9-13-63. I am enclosing a sketch of the object as I saw it. The object was observed for about 45 minutes starting around 8:00 P.M. The object appeared to be hovering and did not seem to move laterally while I observed it. It would, however, change its appearance, i.e., expand and contract. The object had an orange glow and seemed to be translucent. It was about the size of a basketball at arm's length. I am reporting this incident as I feel it may be of interest to you. I would appreciate any feedback you can provide.

Sincerely,
