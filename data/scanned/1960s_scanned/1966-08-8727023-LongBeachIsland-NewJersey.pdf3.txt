There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a typed narrative response to a questionnaire. The text reads:

"OBJECTS TO ME THRU AN OPEN WINDOW. WAKENED MY WIFE AND WE WATCHED FROM THE PORCH, UNTIL DAWN. THEY DISAPPEARED. WE TOOK PICTURES, BUT NOTHING DEVELOPED."
