Dear Sir,
In respect to the recent incident that was reported in the media at Rivesville, West Virginia, I have some additional information that I would like to bring to your attention.

I have talked with the witness, a Mr. [REDACTED], and he has provided me with a more detailed account of what he observed. According to Mr. [REDACTED], the object that he saw was approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was hovering at an estimated altitude of around 200 feet. He states that the object was a metallic gray in color and had a dome-like structure on the top. He also noted that the object made no sound as it hovered and maneuvered in the sky.

Mr. [REDACTED] is a reliable witness with a good reputation in the community. He has no history of making false reports or being prone to exaggeration. I believe his account to be an accurate representation of what he witnessed that evening.

I hope this additional information is helpful in your investigation of this incident. Please let me know if you require any further details from me.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
