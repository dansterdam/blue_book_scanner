"November 27, 1963 

Dear Sir:

This is in reply to your recent letter in which you requested information regarding the Air Force's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena - UFO program.

We are enclosing a brochure on the subject - "The Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program" - which we think will be of interest to you.

Air Force inventories for many years have disclosed no copy of the pilot training manual you mentioned. There is no record of such a pilot training manual.

Sincerely,

EASTON M. JACOBS
Major, USAF
