MEMO FOR THE RECORD 10 December 1965
Major Howard from the Pentagon called. He wanted to find some information as to what he could release as a statement to the public concerning the meteor over Asme, Pennsylvania. Major told him that a team of men were sent out from the Oakdale Radar Site in Oakdale, Pennsylvania. They searched until 2 o'clock, and were unsuccessful in finding the object. This thing was visual, was not picked up by radar. Major told Major Howard that reports came from northern Pennsylvania, Southern Michigan, Northern Ohio, and parts of Indiana. The team of men who were sent out to pick up the object worked along with the State Highway Patrol in trying to recover the object. He explained the Major Howard that the thing could be a meteor or a balloon. He explained that a hollide is a meteor with sound. This thing could travel 2Â¼ miles per second. Major Quintanilla said that it was OK to call it a meteor that entered the atmosphere. He said that investigation is still under way. There was no space debris which entered the atmosphere on 9 December 1965.
