A PHOTOGRAPH FROM HAWAII
A reporter's full account 
BY JEROME SMITH JOHNSON

IN MARCH 1962 there was a report of a strange aerial object sighted over Maui, Hawaii. The incident was recorded by a newspaper reporter with a camera, and the photograph was published in the local press. This is the reporter's own account of what happened:

"On March 9, 1962 a pear-shaped UFO was photographed over Maui, Hawaii by a newspaper reporter. The object was seen at around 10:30 a.m. over the central part of the island and was in view for about fifteen minutes before disappearing. It was disc-shaped, about 20-30 feet in diameter, and was silvery-white in color. The object moved slowly at first, then accelerated and shot straight up out of sight.

This is how I came to photograph the UFO: I was driving along the highway between Wailuku and Kahului, Maui, when I noticed a brilliant silvery-white object hovering in the sky over the central part of the island. I pulled over and stopped the car to get a better look. The object was round, about the diameter of a small house, and was hovering silently at an estimated altitude of 1,500-2,000 feet. 

After a few minutes, the object began to move. It accelerated rapidly and shot straight up, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. I quickly grabbed my camera and managed to take one photograph of the object just before it vanished.

I all members of the press knew about this incident, and many in the Maui area witnessed the object. It was the talk of the island for days afterwards. Unfortunately, the photograph, when developed, did not show the object as clearly as I had hoped. But it does clearly depict the general size and shape of what I saw that morning."
