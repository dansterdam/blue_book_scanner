Transcription of the text:

"They were very low and the moon visibility was the reason the objects seemed to be silvery as they flashed by at 1:42 in the AM. which appeared like a cut of ground level. I was at the restaurant and this time I was putting up a sign. I found the objects to be bright silvery circular things, they seemed to be about 50 feet in diameter and I would estimate their speed to be in excess of 400 miles per hour."
