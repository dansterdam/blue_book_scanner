UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
29 November 1966
Submitted to: 1st Lt. Robert S. Dubiel, Information Office, Walker
AFB, Roswell, New Mexico
NARRATIVE: On Tuesday evening, 22 November 1966, Mr. ______ and his wife were driving from Dexter, New Mexico, to Roswell. As they reached Highway 285 about 20 miles south of Roswell, they observed a bright light in the sky. They watched it for about 20 minutes as it hovered and was a bright white light. The light then shot straight up and was a blinking white light. They drove on trying to figure out what the star or object was.
About 10 minutes later, they observed the object again, this time at an elevation of about 45-50 degrees. The sound was made by it and it moved at high speeds. It then would hover, shooting back and forth, and described it then as a "pulsating light". After the light about 2100 hours, they watched the "UFO" all the way to Roswell arriving about 2100 hours. The object kept following their car. When they arrived in Roswell, the object moved off to the south.
The "UFO" moved at different speeds, but was not erratic. It made sharp, quiet turns when changing directions as opposed to gradual turns. It was stationary at some points and seemed to disappear and reappear throughout the evening to change altitudes. Both Mr. ______ and his assistant guessed that the object was about 20 degrees in size.
