There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. I will now proceed to produce all the text found in the document:

1. MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?   
2. BUDGE IN SLIGHTLY UNNATURAL WAY? 
3. ABRUPTLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
4. SEEM TO PLAY OR DANCE AND RECROSS?
5. CHANGE COLOR?

7. CHANGE SIZE?
8. FLICKER OR SPARKLE? 
9. SPIN LIKE A TOP? 
10. FALL OR TUMBLE?
11. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
All clear late at night. Seemed likely an airplane as distant lights were sighted, but then the lights acted in a way that was completely unusual. The object seemed to be maneuvering in a highly controlled manner, but without any normal air traffic navigation lights.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Fading gradually, casting no arc or trail.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON SHOW UP IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
(Type "NONE" if nothing like this was noted)
NONE
