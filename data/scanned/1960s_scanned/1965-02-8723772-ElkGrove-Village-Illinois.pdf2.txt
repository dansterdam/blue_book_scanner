Orange-ish tinge than reported by Mrs. Crowley, however, in the absence of corroborating evidence with the news media, there is some doubt that the sighting, in any event, produced the effects of the reported sighting, considerable doubt must be thrown on there having been a genuine satellite fragment to be examined by the geologists.

NBC wishes me to come in at the end of this documentary to discuss these sightings. It cough to do this, since the Barrington Hills case is almost certainly a meteor - this case is probably the moon, but the only puzzling case remaining is that of the Elmwood Park police and this is a real puzzler. It is an "Unidentified" case right in our own back yard! It is unfortunate that O'Hare did not report it officially so that it could have been investigated much sooner than it has been!

Sincerely,
