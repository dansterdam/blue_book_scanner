K. Helicopter Pilot and Squadron Administrative Officer. I interviewed the observer Mr.    and received the above information from him concerning the object. He said that the flashing red light appeared to him to be the navigation lights of an aircraft. I am of the opinion that the flashing red light that Mr.       saw was an aircraft proceeding on a normal flight plan. He thought it stopped three times and then disappeared. I gave Mr.       my opinion and he stated it could have been an aircraft, but wasn't sure.
