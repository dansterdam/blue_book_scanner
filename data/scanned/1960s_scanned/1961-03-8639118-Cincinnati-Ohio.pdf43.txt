Gentlemen:

Information: Unidentified flying object

Since I understand that you are interested in all reports of unidentified objects in the sky, I am reporting an incident which occurred on March 2, 1961, visible from Richmond, Indiana.

The object was traveling in a southerly direction, slightly north, but quite low at perhaps 2000 feet above the horizon in a direction somewhat over 20 miles east of north. 

It had a long luminous trail behind it but was not "sparkling off" like a meteor. Also, it did not appear to have a "much greater speed" as called the other meteor-like objects we had been observing in that area where 300Â° above our horizon still pursuing what would call "evasive action" which did not appear to be maneuver characteristic of a meteor.

By thought at the moment "that must be the vehicle of which was reported due to burn about that time."

If you have any information on this incident, I'd very much if be complete notes with you.

All "statistics" are from recollection and not actually measured.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
