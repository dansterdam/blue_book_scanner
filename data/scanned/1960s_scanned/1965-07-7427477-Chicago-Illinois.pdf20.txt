SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Over Chicago, Illinois
on 29 July 1965
An unidentified flying object was observed over Chicago, Illinois on the nights of July 28 and 29, 1965. The object, having a bright yellowish light, apparently moving at a high rate of speed, was observed by many residents in the Chicago metropolitan area. The object seemed to be moving from north to south over Chicago. The observing conditions were good with a clear sky.

The object was observed by one of my friends who stated that it appeared to be slightly smaller than the moon and was moving at a very high rate of speed. He said the object disappeared from view shortly after it was first observed. Another friend of mine, an airman who is stationed at an air base near Chicago, also observed the object and described it as a bright yellowish light, apparently moving at a high rate of speed from north to south over the city. He further stated that the object was visible for only a few seconds before disappearing from view.

There have been many reports of similar unidentified flying objects being observed over the Chicago metropolitan area during the past several years. These objects have been described by observers as being circular in shape, metallic in appearance, and emitting a bright yellowish light. Most of the observers have stated that the objects appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed.

The U.S. Air Force is investigating this latest report and will furnish additional information when it becomes available.
