UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING

LOCATION: TUCSON, ARIZONA
DATE: 6 OCTOBER 1967
TIME: 10:55 PM

WITNESS REPORT:

The witness reported observing a bright, reddish-orange object in the sky that appeared to be descending rapidly. The object then seemed to slow down and hover briefly before crashing into the desert terrain approximately 5 miles southwest of the witness's location.

The witness immediately drove to the suspected crash site and discovered a large, flat object approximately 30 feet in length lying on the ground. The object appeared to be made of a metallic, reflective material and was partially buried in the desert sand and vegetation.

The witness reported the incident to the local authorities, who then contacted the United States Air Force. An investigation was launched, but no further details are provided in this document.
