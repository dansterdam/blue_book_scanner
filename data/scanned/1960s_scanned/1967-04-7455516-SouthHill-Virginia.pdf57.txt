The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book, discussing an incident that occurred in South Hill, Virginia on April 7, 1967.

Text from the document:

The slides, in color, were taken of an unfamiliar object or an unusual assemblage of familiar objects of a distinctive sky. The object was illuminated by two photoflood lamps, one on either side of the camera, to enable the illumination from two angles. One object, for the most part, was an erratic wanderer in the night sky from horizon to horizon. It stood out as if it were an erratic wanderer from a fixed position, not always in the same place, and different in shape from the Crowder UFO, according to his description. Two additional slides show the obligatory flashing and a picture of an unusual gas laser.

Crowder's descriptions were so accurate and perceptive that it seems quite unikkely time on the nights of April 7th really saw one or two human figures on the road and scenery instincts them for a large total satellite or station as in the Crowder case.

And Crowder insists that this is what he saw. He has classified his tower-light object only to the extent that it might have been a large balloon which disintegrated suddenly (to explain its sudden disappearance).

In recent months, someone has painted "PTV C7 HOAX" alongside the burned spot on the road. The "PTV" stands for "Park View High School", suggesting the sign is the work of local teen-agers. (Crowder himself was too sophisticated for such a prank).

I asked Crowder if he thought the incident of his UFO encounter could have been a hoax staged by local high school kids to have built some artificial satellites of their own recorded for science. He replied it was too complicated for high school kids to have built that could be seen, and also that the object's behavior did not appear to be the work of amateurs (inside his office) and it had those three telltale characteristics.
