23 October, 1960
Subject: UFO Sighting
To: Commander
United States Air Force
Project Blue Book
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
From: WITHHELD
WITHHELD, Massachusetts

1. On the evening of 8 October 1960, at approximately 8:50 p.m. EDT, I observed an object in the sky over Westford, Massachusetts, which I believe to be a UFO.

2. The object was first sighted in the southwest sky, approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. It was traveling in a northeasterly direction at a high rate of speed. The object appeared to be circular in shape, approximately 15 to 20 feet in diameter, and was emitting a bright white light.

3. As the object passed directly overhead, I observed that it was not an aircraft, helicopter, or any other known type of man-made vehicle. It was completely silent and did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion.

4. The object continued on its northeasterly course and disappeared from sight in the distance.

5. I am a college-educated professional and have had some experience in observing aircraft. I am confident that the object I saw was not a conventional aircraft or any other known type of man-made vehicle.

6. I request that this report be made a part of the official Project Blue Book files. If you have any questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
WITHHELD
