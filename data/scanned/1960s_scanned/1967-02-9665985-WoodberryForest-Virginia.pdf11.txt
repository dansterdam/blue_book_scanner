Dear Major Quintanilla,

Feb. 20, 1967
I wish to furnish you something extremely strange which occurred at one of Woodberry Forest near Orange, Virginia at 10:22, Feb. 15, 1967.

During that windy night, as the evening and their window became green-white - greenish-white particles from the northeast to the south as the center of the crop. It climbed irregularly, stopped in mid-air, and even always continued in straight. Just before it disappeared over the horizon, it flashed in light (reminded me of like a flash of lightning) and then it disappeared. The shape of the object was similar to that of a capsule and occasionally appeared in the sky.
