The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, but it does not contain any photograph. It consists entirely of text describing an incident observed by ground observers.

exhaust or vapor trail, that it was in view roughly fifteen minutes, and disappeared gradually by "fading out" or trailing all but one of the witnesses agreed that the skies had been absolutely clear, with no clouds, and stated that the day was strikingly clear and bright. The object's region was toward the southwest.

In spite of this general agreement, certain significant discrepancies became evident. The measuring pilot stated that the object appeared to be moving at fantastic speed, as though it were gliding at an incredible speed, and the ground observers, however, did not see any movement of the object on the ground nor was it reported that it remained motionless at all times. ATIC, on the other hand, was unable to determine the speed of the object because the sky had been clear, and thus the object's speed was unrelated to that of any known object against the usual reference points. Also, it was stated that the object appeared to remain stationary for a person who merely stood and watched it. But it seemed to be rapidly moving away from the observer. The pilot's belief that the UFO had exhibited fantastic speed (he assumed it was related to some statement of sightings in other cases) and the fact that the UFO quickly disappeared, however, did not lead to the conclusion that it was speeding, but to the conclusion that its motion was due more to a change in the relative positions of sun and terrestrial observers that produced the illusion of rapid motion rather than any great speed. The final point made down this explanation was that the sun-the distance at which the clock suns appear.

The details of this sighting obviously show a striking resemblance to some of those in the Mantell case (p. 1654) to which the UFO was compared.
