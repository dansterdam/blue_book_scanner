The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or form where the witness has filled out information about a UFO sighting.

Here is the text from the document:

EXACTLY WHEN DID YOU FIRST OBSERVE THE PHENOMENON AND HOW LONG DID IT LAST?
