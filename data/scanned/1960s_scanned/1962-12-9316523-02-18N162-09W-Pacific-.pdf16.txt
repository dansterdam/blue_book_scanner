NO CASE (Information Only)
FIRST WEEK DECEMBER 1962
AKRON, OHIO

LOCAL SIGHTINGS: GREATER AKRON AREA (SE)
The observer was a high school teacher. His report was filled out in the first week of December 1962.
The observer says: the sky was partly cloudy. To the left and near the sun, he observed several elongated objects which he described as looking like a crescent or a broken ring. These objects were motionless and in a vertical position. As he continued to watch, the observer turned down to his left and he saw seven (7) smaller shapeless objects "made out of the same kind of material as the larger crescent-shaped object." The objects remained stationary for the 5-10 minutes that the observer watched them. He was not certain that if they moved at all, they might have been slightly higher in elevation. The objects appeared to be self-luminous or reflecting light but he wasn't sure whether they were self-luminous or not. The sighting ended when the objects faded from view. The size of the crescent-shaped objects was compared to the size of airplanes seen at night, indicating that the smaller objects were about the size of an airplane but the larger crescent-shaped object was somewhat larger.
