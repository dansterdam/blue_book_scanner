The image contains a diagram or sketch showing the horizon and an object in the sky. The text instructs the viewer to imagine the object was first seen at a certain position, and then to draw its path and how its position changed over time. There is no photograph present in this image.

The text in the document states:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the object where you last saw it. Show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
