EXTRACTING TEXT:

4 we have conducted an interview with the witness and obtained the following information:

Miss Lillian
Age - 2

Witness saw an unidentified flying object at approximately 7:00 p.m. on August 18 1966 while driving home alone from work on highway 35 near the town of Forest Lake, Minnesota.

The object was first observed in the northwest sky about 20 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be stationary and was very bright, casting a definite illumination over the area. The object seemed to have a smooth, rounded, metallic appearance.

After observing the object for about 5 minutes, the witness noticed that it suddenly rose vertically and gained altitude rapidly, disappearing from view in about 10 seconds.

The witness appeared to be a reliable and intelligent person. Her story was consistent and she seemed sincere in her description of the incident. The investigator considers her a credible witness.
