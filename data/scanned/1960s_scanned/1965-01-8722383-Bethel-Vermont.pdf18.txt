Subject: Major Jockin M. Jacka

Dear Major Jacka:

Thank you for your prompt return letter of 27 January 1965 concerning the U.S. Air Force Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) report that was submitted through channels. I regret that the delay in responding to your letter is necessary, but as you know, a great deal of activity develops within this office in connection with the UFO program.

The purpose of this letter is to furnish you with some additional information pertaining to the report submitted on 6 January 1965 concerning an observed light in the sky over Bethel, Vermont. The report states that this light was observed for several minutes, and was followed by the appearance of a dark object which eventually disappeared from view.

Please be assured that all UFO reports received by this office are given thorough and complete analysis. We are deeply interested in acquiring all possible data concerning phenomena of this nature. To this end, we would appreciate your forwarding to this office any additional information or data that you might be able to provide, either from your own observation or from other reliable sources in your area. Any diagrams, sketches, or photographs would also be most helpful.

I hope you will convey our appreciation to the witnesses for their report. We consider these reports to be extremely valuable, and we are grateful for the cooperation we receive from citizens such as yourselves. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to call upon me.

Sincerely,

EDWARD J. RUPPELT, Major, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
Directorate of Intelligence
