The image contains two illustrations. The larger one is a compass-like diagram with directional labels, and the smaller ones depict a landscape scene with a person standing in the middle of the road.

Now, here is the text from the document:

4A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'A' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 'B' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND "B" AT THE 
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT
APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO DETAILS AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE
THIS PORTION OF THE REPORT.
