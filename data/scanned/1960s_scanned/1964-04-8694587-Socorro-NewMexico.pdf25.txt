This image does not contain a photograph. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book report from the 1960s. The text on the page appears to be describing "County Data" related to a data-processing department in Texas. It mentions details about staffing, salaries, and ongoing issues within the department.

County Data
The county's new data-processing department, under the direction of Jerry Parks, a former employee, was made operational today by County Commissioners. Mr. Parks will oversee the data-processing department and its ordinance with the super vision of the County Judge. 
The Commissioner's office announced today that starting salary for Mr. Parks will be $600 a month. He will probably have a staff of two machine operators and three clerks. One of the first problems will involve the arrangements with the data machines which the county leases from the T.J. Watson organization of Albuquerque. The county has found that the $108.90 monthly price charged will have to be renegotiated.
