AF IN : 50175 (5 AUG 65)
ACCURATE DETERMINATION. IN THE ALEXANDRIA AERA THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR WITH MANY STARS SHINNING BRIGHTLY. THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT PAGE 3 RWTBUAZSBS9 UNCLAS REPORTS OF UFP IN OTHER SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY. THE INFORMATION OF THE UFO WAS OBTAINED BY A LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE CALL AND HAS POSSIBLE MERIT. ACCORDING TO THE WX STATION AT ENGLAND AFB THERE WAS NO NATURAL WEATHER PHENOMENON WHICH SHOULD HAVE CAUSE SIGHT-INGS. THE STATEMENT THAT NO SOUND WAS HEARD WOULD RULE OUT AIRCRAFT UNLESS AIRCRAFT WAS AT EXTREMELY HIGH ALTITUDE. DETERMINATION OF WHAT OBSERVER REPORTED SEEING HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THIS OFFICE. THE HIGH FLYING AIRCRAFT WITH CONTRAILS IS A POSSIBILITY.
