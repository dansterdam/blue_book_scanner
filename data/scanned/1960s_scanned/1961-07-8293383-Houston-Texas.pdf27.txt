There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a typed letter from the Office of Information, United States Air Force, addressed to someone at Seattle Co. in Washington.

February 7, 1962

Dear Mr. -----:

Your letter of 14 January 1962 has been referred to this office for answer.

Neither of the sightings you mention were determined to be unidentified flying objects and the initial analysis revealed that your description of the level was not sufficient to establish positive identification.

The sighting on 15 December 1961 was determined to be an USAF airplane which was determined to be a B-47 training aircraft. The sighting on 25 December 1961 was determined to be an F-102 fighter plane.

For your information, a copy of AFR 200-2 has applicable portions noted for your information. 

Thank you for your interest and we hope the above information will prove satisfactory.

Sincerely,

C. K. KRAFT 
MAJOR, USAF 
Public Information Division
Office of Information
