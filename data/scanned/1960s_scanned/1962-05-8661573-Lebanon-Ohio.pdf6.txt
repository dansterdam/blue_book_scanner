23 May 1962

Dear Sir, 

Reference your letter requesting identification of an unidentified flying object sighted by you on May 23, 1962. The satellite seen could be a Discoverer satellite from the Lebanon, Ohio, area. This passed overhead from northwest to southeast. It is our conclusion that this was normal satellite activity.

I have included the latest Department of Defense fact sheet on this subject for your further information.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM J. PESCAPO
