The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with text and various questions about the observed object.

Passed out of sight

15. Did the object move behind something or at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Could not be heard

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

It would be about the size of a door knob

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

(A simple sketch of an oval-shaped object is shown.)
