35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I witnessed what I thought was a jet in the U.S.A.F. and the date 1962 as we were a small squadron or unit of 5 persons on a mission of a test run, and this object came down from the sky and hovered over us about 100 yards away. It made no sound and appeared oval shaped. It hovered for about 3 minutes and then took off at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight.
