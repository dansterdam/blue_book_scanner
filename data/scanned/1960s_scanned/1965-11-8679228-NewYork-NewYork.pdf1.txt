The image provided does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

The text on the page reads:

This is an AF command post, we were in the front yard when we saw this thing. The air movement officer came out to see it, it hovered a long time, then it took off south rapidly and then disappeared from sight.

One 189-1930 with the New Yorker office building. This is the second sighting I have made in two weeks where bright object appeared to be moving slowly at uniform speed and then suddenly take off rapidly disappearing in the distance.

This report was originally given to Capt Harrison from the D D R who relayed it to the former N.Y. file. I did not see the object myself but this is the account of the two persons who reported it.

The handwritten text describes the observation of a strange object in the sky, including details about its movement and behavior. There is no photograph present in the image.
