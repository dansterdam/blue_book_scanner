EXTRACT FROM BLIE [sic] BOOK'S REPORT

3. Fighting. The witness in this case is a fifty-year-old girl student residing at in Lansing She is described to he very vague about the concept of apparent angular size and being unable to draw even a simple sketch of her experience.

Her basic story is that as she was riding her bicycle home at about 1800 hours on 21 May 1954, at the corner of Clifford and Prospect streets (about five miles from her home), she heard a loud roaring sound with a steamy, hissing noise overhead. After a few seconds (described as "five minutes" at first) she appeared to be a ball of flashing colored lights in the bottom of the object said later, regarding an intense light-source having a diameter as big as the object in its short dimension. The light was a pale red, and lit up the scene. At some time during this process. the lights around the tops of the trees around the intersection, and the thought the treetops were circled, were out. There was no wind. The light kept shining while the object remained, evidently the object moved away with a puff of heavy smoke, which dissipated slowly and disappeared. The light remained as the object left, and could be seen until it passed far enough for the object to disappear. As the object appeared, it faded away again as the object moved on.
