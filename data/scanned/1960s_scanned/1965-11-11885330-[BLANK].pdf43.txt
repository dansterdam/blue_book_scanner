field. This is quite comparable to modern bubble chamber standards. 
We plan to use these chambers for detecting secondaries of the inter-
actions. Strauch(16) reports that tracks can be seen up to 40° from the electric
field direction. Assuming p = 1 for secondaries in the center-of-mass system
the median angle, 0m, for secondaries is given by (4)

0m ≈ 1/2mp, G2

where the subscript "p" refers to primary proton. For 200 BeV protons, 0m
is about 6°, and the detectors should have good geometry for most secondaries
from an interaction in the hydrogen target. (Actually, the motion imparted to
mesons which leave a fireball that travels backward in the center of mass is
such that occasional particles come off at angles of 50° or more in the labora-
tory system. This is a reason for considering thinner targets such as a LiH
target. (See Appendix II)

Evidently there is a good deal of development work being done on
these chambers and our major effort will be one of adaptation to the problem
at hand. One interesting developmental experiment will be seeing if the cham-
bers will operate at 230° K, the temperature of the stratospheric environment
or, indeed, if they will operate at cryogenic temperatures as a step in simpli-
fying the design of that portion of the experiment.

D. Superconducting Magnets
Magnetic fields are used in this experiment to provide a means
of analyzing the momentum of the incident proton and of interaction products
from the target. Because of power and weight constraints, these magnets
must be superconducting.
Since 1961, when Kunzler and his collaborators(17) stimulated great
interest in superconducting magnets by developing wire cored with a high-field
