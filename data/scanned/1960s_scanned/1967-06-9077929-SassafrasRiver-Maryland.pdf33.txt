The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a technical drawing or diagram related to UFO sightings and reporting. The diagram appears to be an "Official U.S. Air Force" form or document, with instructions and questions for the viewer to fill out based on their observations of a UFO sighting.

Transcribed text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the ground time to show how high the object was above the horizon (azimuth) where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there? Show the direction that they were traveling, and put an arrow to show the direction they were moving.
