The document text is as follows:

OFFICIAL FILE COPY

[Address redacted]
Cleveland, Ohio

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

This letter is in reference to a reported sighting over Cleveland, Ohio on 6 November 1964. The information which we have received is not sufficient to determine the specifics of this sighting, and the case has therefore been classified as incomplete and returned in the self-addressed envelope in order that additional information can be secured.

Your interest in reporting this matter to the Air Force is appreciated.

Sincerely,

HAROLD QUINTANILLA, JR.
Major, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
