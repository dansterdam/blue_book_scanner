"Memoria City Sept 10, 1962

Mr. Brewstead your previous research into this field has been a aid in various ways, and we appreciate it very much. However, according to the light that some now favor us concerning this question, we find it desirable to draw your attention to certain facts that have come to our knowledge during the last few days.

We cannot, at this juncture, be that frank and open as we would wish to be. We find it necessary to be somewhat guarded in our remarks, and to confine ourselves to generalities. This is due to the fact that the ground upon which we stand is not as solid and assured as we would like it to be. We feel, however, that the time is not far distant when we can be more communicative.

We are in receipt of information from various sources, all of which tend to corroborate the fact that the phenomena with which we are concerned have a far wider ramification and much deeper significance than was at first supposed. Certain developments have taken place which, if verified, will revolutionize many of our accepted theories and conceptions.

We are, therefore, anxious to have your further views and comments on this very important subject. We feel that your experience and knowledge will be of great value to us at this juncture.

We are, sir,
Yours faithfully,
[Signature]"
