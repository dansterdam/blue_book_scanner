There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document containing a series of questions and handwritten responses.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Verry quickly take and away from point field view and receding rapidly.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.
Came out, 1 or 2 miles away.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No (Don't Know). IF you answered YES, then tell what. 
Seemed higher than average jets.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: No sound
b. Color: whitish or grayish. 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Not as big as the moon. Probably 1/10 or smaller head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[There is a hand-drawn sketch showing an unidentified object with a tail or exhaust trail.]
