Dear Major-Quintanilla,

Having had read the article on the news about the sighting on Dec. 17, 1966, my husband and I had an experience on Saturday, Dec. 17, 1966 around midnight. 

It was like the following: we were home preparing for bed (the rest of the family was asleep) when we saw a bright light, stationary in the sky. It was like a big star, only much brighter. As we watched it, it suddenly went out, then reappeared. This happened several times when, all of a sudden, it shot across the sky at an unbelievable speed and disappeared. It was in sight only a few seconds each time.

The next day, we heard on the radio and read in the paper about the sightings reported by many in the Whittier, California area that night. We feel that what we saw was the same thing many others reported and we wondered if you had any information on it. I thought you might be interested in our experience.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
