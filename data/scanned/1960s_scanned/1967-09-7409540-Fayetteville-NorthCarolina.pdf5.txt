Dear Sir,

Our station is receiving some sightings along a road that outside of town, within we have a case night installation. 
There has been a nighttime observation, lights on -- 10:57.
Senders see the same lights again this past.
What should be our next step on this incident?
We want to be sure we are handling it properly.

Ted York
