There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with the title "INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING." The page is blank, except for the text at the top and the page number at the bottom.
