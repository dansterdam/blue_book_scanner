Vandenberg Sighting Report
Occurred, it was necessary to go to manual gain control
to separate the signal from the clutter (TPQ-13).
Visual sightings:
a. There were many visuals, but they declined in number as
the radar activity increased.
b. One visual moved toward the observers so alarmingly that
one of them finally yelled, "Duck."
c. One object, dull in color but showing red, white, and
green, moved generally south and finally out of visual
range.
d. Another, with the color of a bright fireball, moved
on a zigzag course from north to south.
e. Richard Hamilton and another radar operator, Carl Bailey,
reported that, "The radar didn't get locked onto what we
saw." By the time the radar slaved to us, the object was
gone visually, and the radar didn't see anything." "It
looked like a fireball coming down through there. Like a
helicopter coming down the coast, at low elevation. We
got the telescope on it." Then it grew smaller and
smaller until it disappeared. Duration: 1-1/2 to 2
minutes. Moved only in azimuth. Observed it through 13-
power telescope. Brighter than a bright star. Like
aircraft landing lights except yellower. The time of
this sighting was after midnight, between 0100 and 0200.
