On February 14, at approximately 2:15 a.m., while sitting with three others by the hotel to our left and the ocean to our right, we saw a bright light, just like the headlight of an automobile, moving through the other stars. The light was about 6 minutes until it came into the aura of the moon. It then dimmed and faded completely from our view. We watched for about 20 minutes, expecting it to come into view again on the other side of the moon - that is, to the right of the moon as we were facing it. However, it did not reappear. I would not have written to the Air Force - I would have thought it was one of the Echo satellites. We have seen a number of times and have also seen some of the Russian satellites.

The direction of this light was roughly from west to east, or it was heading in the direction of the ocean. The direction may have been southwest to northeast.
