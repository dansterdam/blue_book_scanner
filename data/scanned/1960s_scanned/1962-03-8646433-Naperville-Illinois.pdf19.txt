PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS
NAPERVILLE, ILLINOIS
8 MARCH 1962

INTRODUCTION
1. This report presents the results of the investigation of an unidentified aerial object sighting which occurred on 8 March 1962 in the Naperville, Illinois area.

DETAILS OF SIGHTING
2. At approximately 2200 hours on 8 March 1962, two observers reported sighting a bright, fast-moving object in the sky over Naperville, Illinois. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing from view.

ANALYSIS
3. The object was described as a bright, fast-moving light, possibly a star-like object. No other details were provided regarding the object's size, shape, or maneuverability.

CONCLUSIONS
4. Based on the limited information available, the object sighted could not be conclusively identified. While the description is consistent with a bright star or planet, the reported speed of the object is not typical of such celestial bodies. Further investigation would be required to determine the nature of the unidentified aerial object.
