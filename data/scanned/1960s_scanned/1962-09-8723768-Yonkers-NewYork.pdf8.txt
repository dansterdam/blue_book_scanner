Barcavicius - that certainly must be right along the easternmost portion of the craft. The bright lights were in motion, as were the object itself. The speed of the object is estimated to be greater than 3 G forces. How certain is your account sir, as you state. The object resembled no known shape or design but appeared similar to a diamond or egg shape - elongated. The lights on the craft seemed to be either rotating or flashing in sequence, but definitely not synchronized. There appeared to be no exhaust trail or contrail of any kind, and the craft itself appeared to be noiseless.
