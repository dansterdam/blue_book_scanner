'St. Elmo's Fire'
That Flying Saucer Mystery--Perhaps This Can Explain It
Editors' Note: This article, published with a photo taken by Louis Buff of Baytown, Texas, reveals some interesting information about the electrical phenomenon known as "St. Elmo's Fire," which may explain some so-called "flying saucer" sightings.

The text discusses the electrical phenomenon of "St. Elmo's Fire" and how it may explain some UFO sightings, as the glowing, flickering lights can resemble a flying saucer. It also discusses how telephone lines and power lines can be affected by this phenomenon, which may be the cause of some UFO reports.

The second part of the article is titled "Those Zip Codes Stir a Complaint" and discusses issues with the new zip code system in the United States at the time, and how mail delivery was affected if the zip code was not used properly.
