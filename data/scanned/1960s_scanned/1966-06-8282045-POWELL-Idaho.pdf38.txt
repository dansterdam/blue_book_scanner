"I cannot recall exactly the date and time I think it was around the middle of June 1966 when I saw a bright light in the sky near Powell, Idaho. It was our first light, glowing whiteish orange, apparently hovering or standing still, about the size of a dime held at arm's length. An unusual sighting. It moved in a very erratic manner, darting back and forth, up and down, then suddenly accelerating and disappearing from sight in 2 or 3 seconds. It made no sound. I was amazed and fascinated by it, and felt it could not be a normal aircraft or other known object. It was seen by myself and several others, and I believe the incident was reported at the time to the authorities, though I do not know if any investigation was made. I would be most interested in any information or explanation the Air Force could provide about this incident."
