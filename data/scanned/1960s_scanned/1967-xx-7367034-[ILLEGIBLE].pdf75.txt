DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
SUDDENLY APPEARED AND THEN WENT AWAY
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODES
CHANGE COLOR
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS
BLINK LIGHTS
FLASH OR FLARE
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR
STILL VISIBLE ASSETS
MAKE A NOISE
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE
14. WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

The fact that something out of the ordinary was appearing, changing, and disappearing.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It just faded away and was gone in around 1:30, not just all at once though.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING. LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
when it faded away, it seemed to me to be directly overhead at one point, with no obstructions.
