Dear Sir:
It will probably not come as much of a surprise to you -- it certainly didn't to me -- that at 6:05 pm Friday, Sept. 13, 1968, I saw and was astonished by a UFO. I came into contact with it at a good altitude. It was going extremely fast, much faster than any jet I have ever seen. As it circled, it was swaying as if it had no controls. It disappeared behind the trees and I could see no evidence of any engine or propellant. I am age twelve. My address is Huntington, L.I., N.Y. 11743.
Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
P.S. My father, [Redacted], is a pilot, retired weather C.A.V.U.
