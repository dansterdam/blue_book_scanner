Great Pains Taken To 'Prep' Man-Orbiting Atlas Boosters

When Col. Walter M. Schirra lifts off in the Mercury capsule this October, he will be boosted into space by an Atlas booster that has undergone a grueling series of preparatory tests and preparation in order to be ready for this critical mission. The unique Mercury capsule will be boosted by a special modified version of the Atlas, the Atlas D, which is being readied for this mission under the watchful eye of the AFSWC Scouting Group.

Such a shakedown is necessary to assure that the Atlas booster, which must perform flawlessly, is properly prepared and checked out in every detail before the big day. The Air Force's intense preparations and the multi-thousand component tests that make an Atlas booster the world's most complex device, are described in this article.

"The Air Force's intensive and extensive testing program for the Atlas booster for the Mercury program has paid off and enabled us to improve the reliability of the Atlas booster to a high degree," Colonel Brundage, systems manager for the Atlas booster program, stated. "This has resulted in an Atlas booster that is more reliable and dependable than it has ever been in the past."

American astronauts know that the Atlas booster, on which they must place their lives, must perform flawlessly. An Atlas booster must be able to boost the 3,000-pound Mercury spacecraft from earth to an altitude of 100 miles, and then separate cleanly and accurately so that the spacecraft can continue its flight into orbit. Any Atlas booster malfunction, even a relatively minor one, could prove disastrous.

"That's the reason for this intensive testing program," Colonel Brundage pointed out. "We want to take advantage of our ability to thoroughly checkout and test the Atlas booster in advance. This intensive and extensive ICBM testing enables us to pinpoint and correct any potential malfunctions or shortcomings before the actual manned shot."

The extensive ground checkout, including literally thousands of individual tests, means that the Atlas booster for the Mercury shot not only takes twice as many man-hours to prepare for launching as a standard ICBM, but also requires special procedures to assure perfect performance. Hundreds of special checkouts, ranging from close scrutiny of every electrical connection to dynamic balance and vibration tests, are performed on the Atlas.

"We don't take any chances," the Colonel stated flatly. "The Mercury astronaut's life is at stake, and we intend to make that Atlas booster as nearly perfect as it can possibly be before we light the fuse."

This intensive preparation even extends to the manufacturing process. Parts that are marginal or questionable in any way are ruthlessly discarded. Only the most perfect components go into that special Mercury-rated Atlas.
