The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with handwritten text.

Transcribed text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
I first sight of the object was at approximately 8:16 p.m. The object was traveling from the northeast to the southwest at an estimated altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 feet. It was a bright orange-red in color and oblong in shape. It seemed to be moving at a very rapid speed, much faster than any commercial aircraft I have ever seen. After approximately 3 or 4 minutes it disappeared from sight, apparently going behind some trees.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None, just a bright orange-red light
b. Color: Bright orange-red
c. Size: Oblong, approximately 1/4 the size of full moon

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About 1/4 to 1/5 of the full moon, it seemed to be about 1/4 to 1/5 the size of the full moon.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch such details as you can recall, such as number of wings, tail, etc., and especially include a sketch of the vapor trails, if any. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
