MARCH-APRIL, 1965

Incident In Australia

Officials Excited!
A report forwarded by the Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society is most interesting although now a year old: 

"On May 2, 1964, an incident occurred which sent officials of the U.S. State Department to rush out reports to the CIA, the National Security agency, the National Aeronautics and Administration, and the Army and the Navy. The incident was investigated by the Scientific Attache of the American embassy at Canberra, Dr. Paul Siple and two NASA engineers. 

Just before day near Canberra, a large, white glowing object traveled across the sky in a northeast direction. The object was wobbling and appeared to the observer as to be out of control, a small UFO hovered, showing a faint red light. The large UFO moved in a straight line very fast for about four seconds and appeared to collide with the smaller UFO. The impact seemed to cause both to bounce. There was no explosion.

The large UFO then turned, no longer wobbling, moved slowly away from the smaller UFO, then accelerated away at a very high speed."
