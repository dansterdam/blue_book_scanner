Dear Sir,
I have seen what I feel was a real UFO, not just an aircraft or something else. My wife was with me and we observed it about 8:30 pm. It was stationary at first and then it began to move rapidly to the northeast. Its size was about the size of a dime held at arm's length. Its shape was elongated and the color was grey. At one point it appeared to be spinning and we could see a sort of exhaust coming from it. It was moving very fast and we lost sight of it after about 30 seconds. We were quite excited about the sighting and wish we could have observed it longer. The object was not like any aircraft I have ever seen. Sincerely,
