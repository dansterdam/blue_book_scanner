AIR MINISTRY EXCELS ITSELF
"For the 6-wing Standard, May 13, Air Ministry officials are 'baffle? reports of an 'unearthly' flying object which several people have seen high in the sky over Bedfordshire during the night. One eye-witness, taxi driver Mr. John Hodge, of Luton, said: 'It looks like a luminous object, sometimes hovering and sometimes moving - it gave off beams of light radiating from it.' 
'Mr. Hodge said it could not be a planet. 'It could also not be a satellite, since it stays still for long periods,' he said.
Mr. Jack Hughes, of Abbey Drive, Luton, said: 'As I watched it, the thing began to swing in a pendulum-like swinging motion.'
'An Air Ministry official said he was unable to give any explanation. 
'It might be a weather balloon with lights on - or it might even be with the planet Venus, which does sometimes move in an extraordinary manner,' he said.
