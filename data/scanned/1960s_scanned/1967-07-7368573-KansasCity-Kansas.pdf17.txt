May 14, 1969

Major General John Murphy
Director, Legislative Liaison
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C. 20330

Dear General Murphy:

I would like to take this opportunity to request an official report from the Department of the Air Force with regard to their investigation of a reported sighting of an "unidentified flying object" on or about July 3, 1967 in the Kansas City, Kansas-Missouri area.

One of my constituents, Mr. [redacted] of Leawood, Kansas, has brought to my attention a report on his observations of this phenomenon, and it is my belief that the Air Force has similarly received other information regarding similar observations which have largely been ignored and laughed at over the years.

I am enclosing the entire file, which has been excellently prepared and is complete and comprehensive, in order to allow the Air Force to make a thorough and prompt investigation of this occurrence. This location is in close proximity of one of the largest and most important Air Force bases in the United States, and I strongly believe that the significance of this report demands acknowledgment and action.

Thank you for any assistance you may offer. As a member of the Science and Astronautics Committee here in the House, I am most interested in the UFO issue.

Most sincerely,
Larry Winn, Jr.
Member of Congress
