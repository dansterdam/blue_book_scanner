The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing a list of questions about a UFO sighting and handwritten responses. 

Here is the text contained in the document:

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME? 
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLASH ON AND OFF?
SPIN LIKE A TOP? 
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
IS WHAT CITY YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

The witness has provided detailed handwritten responses to these questions, describing their observations of the UFO sighting. The last section asks "DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?" and the witness has provided a lengthy written response describing the movement and appearance of the observed object.
