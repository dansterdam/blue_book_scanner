4939 Ashtou 1965

In one of the say the strangest thing last
started around 21.0 went out to the field and the aif
was a little funny color it was going.

We saw Dave and I last last from becoming a quite a 
strange thing was going on at the first it vas just bright
of the lake resembling the bright star-like thing, 
and after a while it started hovering and would disappear
something there.

We burned gas to the the jet to take up to chase it and
actually it would be back a weak even with the entire low 
clouds from the horizon.

At first it was vary faintly blinking about 8 feet to very
bright and back to faint again other times it would have a
rather round more of shape was the light would be steady
sometime it was propelling sideways as planes do but
its think. The lights were mainly red and white and blue.

It was a rather slender climbing straight up to a
great speed color oddness. 

The all said the same view as watched it would seem to disappear
plane lights, all looking but you can't usually find it.
The like suddenly disappear with fantastic speed and
size were all on with the comparison. They were not any air
blasted on nor speed sounds.

Then the thing headed more until it was over the mountains
behind the trees. That it seemed to be coming more
down closer look from the way it moved rapidly and
moving faster.

At the time it turned away, we began to see a in the
sky how he moved in all directions, up, down all around
not any grace declined. It was clear-cut like glass
thing disappears would have look at but.

It was flying just above the treetops. Just before it went
behind trees, the said brightly seemed to be an the
sky when front was more definitely seen the object more
clear from not low.
