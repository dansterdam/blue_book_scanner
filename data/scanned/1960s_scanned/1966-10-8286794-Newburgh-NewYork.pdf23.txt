There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text output is as follows:

T. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or flying vehicles in the area which might possibly account for the sighting:

V.F.R. air traffic on down-wind, base, and final to runway 27 at Stewart AFB flyover and parallel the Beacon-Newburgh Bridge. TACAN approach #3 and Enroute/VCAN approach to Stewart also parallel the Bridge on final. In addition, numerous VFR traffic use the Bridge as a check point and the Hudson River as an airway. The 904th Troop Carrier Group (CONAC) at Stewart AFB is presently checking out in C-124 aircraft and were flying approaches to runway 27 on the date of Mrs. ___ sighting.

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:

Captain Stephen Levine, USAF, Rated Pilot/Navigator

(1) All available evidence indicates that Mrs. ___ observed an aircraft:

(a) Mrs. ___ is very sketchy on the date and time of her sighting and as a result, it is impossible to exactly match her observations with reported traffic.

(b) A C-124 on base to Runway 27 at 1000 hours would appear the same as the description Mrs. ___ gave of the object she sighted. The C-124's relatively small wings compared to its large fuselage would appear as a contrasted silver object in the shape of a cigar.

(c) I questioned toll takers who were on duty on the Bridge at the time of the sighting. They stated there was very heavy air traffic but nothing unusual.

(d) Traffic on the Bridge and its location joining two large towns leads me to believe that any UFO would have attracted hundreds of telephone calls than just Mrs. ___'s. Obviously what Mrs. ___ saw was not considered unusual.

(e) Refer to C(2).
(f) Refer to F(1).

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs: N/A
