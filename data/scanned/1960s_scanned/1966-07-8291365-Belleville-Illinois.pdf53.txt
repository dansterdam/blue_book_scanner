I have seen a very cigar shaped object just emerging from behind some bushes about 50 yards away. It was about 40' long and 15' in diameter of shiny metallic appearance. It appeared and then just as quickly disappeared. It was quite a large object. I have never seen any things like it before.

I am always on the lookout for clues of strange aircraft. As a man of practical experience I know how they are powered, by electricity with lightning at the core. The only thing I wish I could understand more is what might be the purposes.
33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? I didn't tell anyone I saw this unusual sighting more than a little while ago.
