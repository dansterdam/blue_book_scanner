Dear Sirs,

My wife and I own and operate a small motel here at Nantucket Point on the tip of Long Island, New York. We operate under another name and number, and in winter occasionally send to transient workers or personnel working at one of your radar installations here at Point.

The Long Island Rail Road has its last station here about 3/4 mile from here. Adjacent to the "Republic Aeroplane" has a small warehouse installation.

A Mr. ________, who works for the L.I.R.R. on car maintenance, and who resides here with his wife, came to me with a strange story one morning. 

Incidentally this young man has been with us about 3 weeks, is a good worker, sober and as far as I can see, reliable.

His story about the elusive "flying saucer." I myself here never seen one and probably never will in the foreseeable future. Mr. _________ talked about it to me, and I gauged he had seen a "cloud of something", an illusion or reflection--another fleeting glimpse, unstable vision or hallucination; but when he said he had this paper-thin discs close to above him for about a whole hour; then I was amazed.

Mr. _________ was on the night shift beginning Jan 4th 7:30 p.m. to dawn of Jan 5th. He was busy filling the tanks on the train at about 3 a.m. of Jan 5--when upon his way down, with a guided gasoline tender car to near and then. The engine are constantly in warm-up, so any sounds the object could have made were deadened.

He happened to look up from his work, and hovering above him at what he estimated to be about 100 feet was this craft, as he described it, perfectly round, in thickness, like two saucers placed against one another, thicker in the middle and tapering toward the edge.

Because of the moonlight and the clearness of the night, the shining metal structure was clearly visible. On top of the object, in the center, was a plume of bright blue light, like an exhaust of some sort.

He estimated it to be about 75 feet across its diameter. Every once in a while it would execute a series of runs (?) , dips and maneuvers in all directions, at times at terrific speeds close to the ground, but never lower than about 900 feet."

He said he saw no signs of any ports (?) or windows or lighting on it, outside of the blue light on top.
