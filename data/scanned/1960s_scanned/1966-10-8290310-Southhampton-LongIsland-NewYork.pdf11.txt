The image contains a photograph of an alleged UFO and also shows three star trails. The report discusses the analysis of the photograph, including measurements of the positions of the three stars (Alpha Aries, Beta Aries, and Gamma Aries) and the separation of the three stars in declination. The report also mentions the plate scales obtained, uncorrected for geometry, and how they were used to compute an effective focal length for the lens used to make the 8 x 10 print.

SPECIAL REPORT ON PHOTOGRAPH
of three 8 x 10 prints submitted by Mr. --------, Southampton, L. I., to Mr. W. R. Robinson, one contains a photograph of an alleged UFO and also shows three star trails. A study of star and moon positions previous to the date of the supposed UFO photograph has shown that the three trails are images of the three brightest stars in the constellation Aries. The hypothesis was tested that the bright elongated object in the picture is a trailed image of the moon.
The coordinates of the three stars (1966) are as follows:
Alpha Aries 2h 05m 15s +23° 18' 09"  
Beta Aries 1h 52m 45s +20° 38' 33"
Gamma Aries 1h 53m 16s +19° 07' 40"
The first task was to calculate the plate scale on the assumption that these were in fact the coordinates of the ends of the star-trails. 
Since the paths were parallel on the print, the declination difference (at right angles to the direction of trail) was used. The separation of the three stars in declination, on the print, was measured to be
Alpha-Beta 0.695 inch
Beta-Gamma 0.333 inch
The plate scales obtained, uncorrected for geometry, were then used to compute an effective focal length for the lens used, as if the photograph were made directly onto the 8 x 10 print. The result was 16.31 inches. If the original negative were a 4 x 5 plate, the lens would have had a focal length to 3 inches; if a 35 mm camera were used, the focal length comes out to be 55 mm., quite close to a standard lens.
