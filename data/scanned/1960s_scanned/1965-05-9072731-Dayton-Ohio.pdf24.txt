The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a diagram and instructions for sketching the motion and path of a UFO sighting. Specifically, it asks the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects and any changes in direction during the course of the sighting.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass diagram to show in what direction the object was traveling.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
