Dear Sirs:

May 27, 62 at the beginning of night I saw a big flow of light in the sky just over the hill. That light at 2:00 it went away. The one whom saw it with his mother and two sisters. The "Unusual light" was playing around in school near friend and began to rise. Then he said it was over and moved up and down.

It came back there was about 6 minutes and then went out of sight. And when it came back there was not until May 29, 62. We saw it again. I called my parents to go out side and see it. It did the same thing move around and disappear. It look like the Unidentified Flying Objects that some of the service men in the Army took pictures of. I saw the movie and the U.S. AIR FORCE had on them. My address is:

Troy, New Hampshire

Yours truly
