The witnesses, not contended to describe what they actually saw, were embroidering inconsequential details which could not be investigated or substantiated. The account of the sighting, Hynek stated, not one of the most reliable ones he has had, is one of the sounding of the best substantiated reports. Usually, one finds many contradictory or incredulous - details, but, on this case, the details seemed to hold up on investigation. However, the eyewitness, who carefully observed what he saw, certainly was not of a caliber we usually term cranks or visionaries.
The witnesses reported seeing what was described as a very bright, hovering object on the southern horizon. It was estimated to be about the size of the setting moon and pulsed or flashed at irregular intervals. A local resident, who had apparently observed the same phenomenon in the same general location sometime earlier, also reported the incident.
