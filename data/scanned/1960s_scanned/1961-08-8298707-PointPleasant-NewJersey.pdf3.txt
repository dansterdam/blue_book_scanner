Dear Sirs:
I reside in Point Pleasant N. J. Today August 9, 1961 at 12:45 I observed a satellite moving in a South East direction. It is a brilliant satellite and appears to be on other orbits as there are smaller satellites on other courses at the same time.
I was wondering since I see it so often if you could take the time to let me know what kind of a satellite it is and if it is one of theirs.
I am quite curious about this satellite and if you have the information I request I would greatly appreciate it.
Sincerely,
Point Pleasant N J
