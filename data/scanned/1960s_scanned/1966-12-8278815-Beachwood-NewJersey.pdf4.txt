MAY 23 1967

Dear Mr. _________,

Reference your recent letter requesting Air Force conclusions on your sighting of December 3, 1966.

Although a positive identification has not been made, the description you provided is consistent with the bare of an unidentified flying object sighted over the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. It is continually engaged in air training exercises and both pilots and ground crews at the station have sighted similar objects on numerous occasions. 

Again, I want to stress that we are unable to make a positive identification, but after detailed study, it does appear aircraft could have been responsible for the sighting. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Sincerely,

GEORGE J. FREEMAN, JR.
