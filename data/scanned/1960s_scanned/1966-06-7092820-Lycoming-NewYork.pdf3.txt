Unidentified Flying Object Sightings

1. Reference the attached letter from [REDACTED] regarding unidentified observations on 5 June 1966. It is felt that she and her husband are reliable observers. On 5 June 1966, between the hours of approximately 10:30 PM and 1:30 AM, they observed a light, round like a star, moving slowly at an estimated altitude of approximately 10 degrees. In the spring and summer Venus is frequently observed and considered the station, but considering its stalled latitude of -35Â° on 5 June, it would have been unusually high in the sky. This fact, and the steady nature of the object, with no oscillation, and considering its stalled latitude, indicates this was not Venus. The object was not affected by atmospheric disturbances and clouds. The increase in density of the atmosphere nearer the earth's surface would have caused distortion, but this was not evident.

2. We are unable to make an evaluation on her observation of 2 April 1966 without additional information. If she desires an evaluation on this particular sighting, she is requested to complete a report form.
