Information on 26 June 1963
Saith Weymouth, Mass.

On June 26, Mr. and Mrs. Enrico Gil-
bert of East Weymouth spotted a UFO
while driving. They reported the
sighting to the Weymouth Police Station
at 12:05 A.M. According to the report,
the authority who took the report "didn't
seem too impressed." The description of
the sighting: Both Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert
described the craft as "very large."
Higher than a truck, with a brilliant white
light and dark colored "arms or wings"
protruding from the sides. They said
the object flew "with a humming sound"
about 100 feet from the ground, after
the tension wires near the Gilbert home. It
then, Gilbert said, "was lost discending
into the nearby trees." Gilbert described
two or more exactly, two saucers in-
volved. He said they made two or three
circles some 100 feet in the air, then "took
off fast and rapidly disappeared as if
it had shot up into the air like a rocket."
Gilbert said the rear was deafening. "Up
went two silver things of these people.
They were flying and hovering as usual. 
It and it was some sort of machine, not
a balloon or some other explanation."
