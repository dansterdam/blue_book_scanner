This matter rec. 18 Jan.
Dear Sir:
The writer and my friends are investigating flying saucers. We have been studying the flight of saucers for a year now, and I have proof that flying saucers and saucer-like craft exist on earth. I have seen saucers land and and I got pictures of them to prove it.

I took the picture at night with a polaroid camera, the date was November 12, 1967. Here is the story: I went out to check on some things. I noticed no seconds later a humming noise. There was a large, round, flat object hovering about 150 feet above the ground. It was still, then I realized it was a flying saucer. I ran upstairs and got the camera and I took the picture. This was an example believe -

F - lease write back.
