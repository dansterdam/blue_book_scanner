Catholic Inn, Sacred Heart School, Sister 
Sister  was contacted at her quarters on the 10th of March. An interview was conducted and the following statement was given:

At 11:30 hours on the 10th of March, I observed an object above the trees across from the school yard. At first the object appeared to be a small craft but it seemed to move erratically. I observed it for five minutes and as it was viewed through the trees, it appeared as a bright yellowish elongated object. It seemed to hover, to ascend, and to move downward. I observed it for a total of 9 minutes. The observation was made in the school yard and made the same observation as I did.
