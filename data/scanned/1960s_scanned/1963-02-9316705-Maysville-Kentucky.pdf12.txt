SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT 10073 SIGHTING - MAYSVILLE, KENTUCKY

The report of a "flying saucer" sighting at Maysville, Kentucky, on August 12, 1963, has been investigated. Information gathered from the observer and other sources indicates that the object observed was most probably a conventional aircraft and that the sighting does not warrant further investigation under Project 10073.
