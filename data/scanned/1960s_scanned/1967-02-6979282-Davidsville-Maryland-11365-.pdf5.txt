DAVIDSVILLE, MARYLAND
11 MARCH 1967
CASE NO. 6979282
On 11 March 1967, at approximately 1810 EST, this writer was called by Mrs. L.D. Trant, 10 Main Street, Davidsville, Maryland, and informed that she had observed a strange object in the sky at approximately 1750 EST. She stated that the object was hovering and that she had taken two photographs of it with her 35mm camera. Mrs. Trant was requested to bring the film to this writer's office as soon as possible for development and examination.
At approximately 1900 EST, Mrs. Trant arrived at this writer's office and turned over the exposed film. The film was then taken to a local photographic processing laboratory for development.
The two photographs obtained were of poor quality due to the poor light conditions and the distance of the object from the camera. The object appears to be round or elliptical in shape and is approximately 1/2 to 1 inch in diameter on the 35mm negative. No further details can be determined from the photographs.
This case is being forwarded to Project Blue Book for additional investigation and analysis.
