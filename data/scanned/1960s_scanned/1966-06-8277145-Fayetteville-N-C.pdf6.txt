15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
    Covered completely by a match head at arm's length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically show trails or vapor trails. 
    Place an arrow inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

    Director's note: The sketch shows a circular object with the description: 1st sighting, 2nd - 5th sightings, same as 1st.
