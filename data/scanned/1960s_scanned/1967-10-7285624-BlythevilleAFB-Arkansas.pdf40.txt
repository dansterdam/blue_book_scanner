MEMO FOR THE RECORD

"21 Feb 1966

Talked to Lt. Mosley (SPAFRS)

On Oct 22 the decline of the platform decayed at 10572 5min. Lt. Mosley checked for visuals on the decay but only had one via. form Turkey and it took place at 09:42. 1. Lt. Marano, asked him if these things often break up during re-entry and if a piece could have come down about 20 min. after the predicted decay. He stated that the objects often do break up as they start to decay and that usually they only last the time of decay of the main piece. However the angle of inclination of the object was only 4.7 degrees.
