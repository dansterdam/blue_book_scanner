There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text found in the document is as follows:

THE SUBJECT'S ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN HIS STORY AND SOME 'TYPICAL' UFO STORIES AND HE WAS ASKED WHETHER HE THOUGHT HIS EXPERIENCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENON. HIS RESPONSE WAS THAT HE DID NOT SEE HOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENON, AS HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. HE STATED THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THE OBJECT IN DETAIL BUT IT SEEMED TO BE ROUND OR OVAL IN SHAPE AND ILLUMINATED FROM WITHIN. HE SAID IT HOVERED FOR A SHORT WHILE AND THEN SUDDENLY ZOOMED AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME, AS REPORTED BY THE OBSERVER, WERE CLEAR AND STARRY. THERE WERE NO UNUSUAL NATURAL PHENOMENA GOING ON AT THE TIME, SUCH AS AURORAS, METEORS, SATELLITES, ETC. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL.

THE SUBJECT IS VERY DEFINITE IN HIS BELIEF THAT HE SAW AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. HE STATES THAT HE HAS NEVER HAD AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THIS BEFORE AND THAT IT IS NOT IN KEEPING WITH HIS NORMAL WAY OF THINKING. HE SEEMS SINCERE AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE TYPE WHO WOULD MAKE UP A STORY FOR ATTENTION-GETTING PURPOSES.
