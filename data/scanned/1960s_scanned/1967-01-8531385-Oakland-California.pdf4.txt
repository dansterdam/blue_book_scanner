The image contains a hand-drawn diagram showing a curved horizon line and several angle markers. There is also a compass-like design in the top right corner. The text below the diagram instructs the viewer to draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made, and to place an "A" at the beginning of the path and a "B" at the end to show the changes in direction during the course. The second part of the text indicates that there was more than one object, and asks the viewer to draw a picture showing how many there were and the direction they were traveling.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place or "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end, to show any changes in direction during the course.
29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 5 to 7
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
