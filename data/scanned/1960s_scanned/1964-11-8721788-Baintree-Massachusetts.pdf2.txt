Dear Mr. _____,

It is not true that the Air Force withholds or censors any information concerning unidentified flying objects observed by private citizens. The Air Force has directed its observers and researchers to furnish all information concerning such sightings.

Attached is a copy of AF Form 164, which is used for reporting UFO observations. If you wish to submit a report of your sighting, the Air Force will be informed of the circumstances.

Sincerely,

MAJOR M. JACKS
Chief, Historical Branch
