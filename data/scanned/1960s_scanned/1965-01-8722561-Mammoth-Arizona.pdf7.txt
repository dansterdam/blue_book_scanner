The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document appears to contain typewritten text, with some portions redacted or obscured.

The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output of the text in the document is as follows:

The witness contacted may that a circular objet about 20 feet in diameter and 4 to 5 feet thick was sighted about 15 feet above the ground, 300 feet away, for about 15 minutes. The object had a bright, metallic appearance and was rotating slowly. After 15 minutes, it suddenly shot straight up out of sight.

The witness states that he was with another man and both of them watched the object for the entire time. They claim the object made no sound and did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion.

As the object rose, it appeared to be tilting and rotating as it accelerated straight up until it disappeared from view. The witness is described as a reliable person who appears to have given a detailed, sincere account of the sighting.
