The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

"1. Mr. Deyell to review UFO prior to a final decision as to what course of action should be taken on UFO cases. Review all reports with a view to selecting the most significant for detailed analysis and recommendation to the scientific advisory panel.

2. The plan as outlined in Attachment 3, AFCIN 270-17, is January 1960 to continue the procedure to screen other government agency for the following reasons:

a. The communication of all reports with handling the communication would be facilitated if a single directive agency were established.

b. Transfer of the program to some agency such as NASA would only serve to limit the investigations to interplanetary space vehicles.

c. Certain programs conducted would be many times more expensive than the present method of operating and would give no better results than the present method unless a much larger staff were required regarding operations.

d. Allen Hynek is the consultant regarding scientific considerations made by Dr. J. Allen Hynek.

The Air Force contractor would serve principally as an analyzing agency, and the analysis would still find it necessary to investigate the majority of the reports it received.

e. It would be necessary to provide a contractor with specialized research in certain cases, special programs and/or operations; and other specialized information to support their work.

f. Air Force personnel would be required to monitor the contract and provide 'support' to the contractor.

In the FTD opinion that the UFO program should be discontinued as a special Air Force activity, Closing the Project Blue Book would transfer this responsibility to the agency that is given this assignment."
