"INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

During the night of Jan 5, 1968 while driving on state Rt. 340 toward Columbus, Ohio, my wife noticed two lights coming up in the darkness. At first she thought they were airplane lights, but as they approached they appeared to be too large and close to the ground. I watched them for approximately 2 to 3 minutes as they passed over our car from the rear and went on ahead. They were about the size of a 2 car garage but did not have any red or green running lights like an airplane. They seemed to be round in shape and not making any sound that we could hear while passing over us. After they passed on ahead of us they simply disappeared from view."
