Proposed reply to letter from Mrs.  on 12 March 1967
Dear Mrs. , 
Reference your letter of 12 March 1967 concerning your unusual observation in September 1966. I appreciate your kind letter and definitely feel you must have observed something most unusual; however, I can not offer too much in the way of an explanation.
The only thing that comes to mind would be an artificial cloud release that occurred on 24 September 1966 from Wallops Island, Virginia. A rocket was launched at approximately 0413 EST. At altitudes of 315 and 370 statute miles, there were two enormous cloud releases. This was seen and reported as a UFO by individuals from as far west as Indiana. It did light up the eastern sky. 
I am very doubtful that this was what you observed. This, of course, is only a shot in the dark. I was wondering if the sound and visual observation were unrelated. Another possibility is a static discharger, but this also is just a guess.
Your information will definitely be kept on file which adds to our data base. The late date would not permit a detailed investigation at this time. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
