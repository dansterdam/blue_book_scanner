The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, containing text only.

The text in the document is as follows:

"1. The investigating officer is the squadron intelligence officer, and although visual sightings are not his primary duty, experience indicates that his observations are usually reliable. 

2. At the time that the observer reported seeing this object, the local weather conditions were clear and visibility was good. Although the sighting may have not been probable, it certainly was not.

3. The observer described the light conditions as dark at P.i. minutes after last observation.

4. The area in which the object was sighted is aligned with that of another possible UFO report, but the object's description and duration of observation does not suit all the criteria sightings.

5. Parachus placed from the Caro-Pilot area (37 09'47'', 77 33'W) were checked in 1960. Parasite load conditions prevailing at that time indicated correlation and possible similarity, but results were inconclusive.

There are those obvious discrepancies in the observer's standpont:

(1) Sky coverage
(2) Description dark of light conditions at P.i. minutes after

7. The investigating officer has checked local sources for information on this sighting and has not been able to identify the sighting."
