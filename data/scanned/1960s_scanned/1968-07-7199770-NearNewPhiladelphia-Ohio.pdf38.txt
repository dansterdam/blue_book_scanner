Dear Sir:

At about 3:15 we were going east on RR33 highway between the Minerva and Canton area and we sighted a bright light object hover about 75 yards off the ground and it appeared to be very close. We stopped the car and turned to the right and it was gone, just disappeared.

It was a bright and flying object and was a distance of about a quarter of a mile away from us.
