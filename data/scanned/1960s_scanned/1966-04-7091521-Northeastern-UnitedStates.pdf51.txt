Flying Saucers? No

Prof. Smiley Doubts The Eerie Stories

By GEORGE POPKIN

'Scattered flying saucers reported over the earth as 'Dr. Constant H. Smiley, associate University astronomer kept shaking his vigorous head at our time.'

'Namely, the theory that intelligent life from outer space is stopping about our planet to observe its inhabitants and their activities."

"For a period and excited man, chief scientist at North American Aviation, set in motion what he sees are delusions.

"A student told him in class that he had sighted a flying saucer over Riverside." 

"Since the student had been unable to gain admittance to Smiley's observatory, He concluded, "as a scientist," that the student, and others like him, might have seen some unusual thing in the sky.

"Said Professor Smiley, 'I do not have a very small mind as that would indicate.

"I have met from time to time. It was very bright that night, and low over the horizon. But it was a record center. It turned out there were some nearby. What he had seen was a haze being used in an experiment. It is part of our scientific investigation here."

"Whether the visitor spoke English. When she related this was his assessment; 'it cannot be so.'"
