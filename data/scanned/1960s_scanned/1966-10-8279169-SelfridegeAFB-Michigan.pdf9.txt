The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was the official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

ATTN OF: 1-330  

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING  

TO: AFSC (SLD) WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO 45433  

1. The attached correspondence was not forwarded previously because we did not recognize the witness as reliable.  

2. However, she has telephoned us many times in the past few weeks, and has threatened to write to the President of the United States if we do not take action.  

3. The letters therefore, should be brought to your attention. Perhaps you can advise us on what action to take, if any, in a case like this.  

FOR THE COMMANDER
