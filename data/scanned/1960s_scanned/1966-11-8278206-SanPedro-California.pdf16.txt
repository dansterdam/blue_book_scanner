Dear Sir:

About the same time that the 10:52 blast report, there was a bright light, moving straight up at about 45 degrees and then planing off in a horizontal direction. It was moving very fast and upward. About the same time as this light appeared to be moving, I heard a tremendous blast, loud as a cannon. It was about 20 to 30 seconds after I saw the light moving that I heard the sound. There are three years ago I noticed the same field of about two or three yards across out in my backyard at home. I'm wondering whether a sizable communication system working on some unknown radio energy, and a communicator had landed commission. I have the distinct impression when this light was running that there was some connection with the noise. It is my firm belief that they have used some kind of very high frequency to explode the B52. The government authorities have asked me not to discuss this any further. So be that in this end, the gist of the explosion.
