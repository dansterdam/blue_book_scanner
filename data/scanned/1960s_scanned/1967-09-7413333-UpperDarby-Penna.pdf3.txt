It seems I have filled out a report before, a few years ago I was in near my home working in my yard when I saw an object in the sky. It was circular in shape and had alternating light rays or energy beams coming from the underside. It was hovering stationary at first. Then it took off at a fantastic speed, there was no sound. The first time I watched it for about 5 minutes. The last time I saw it was on January 27, 1965. It was very low, maybe 200 feet up, and just slowly drifted across the sky and went out of sight. I have not seen it since then. The U.S.A.F. detachment at Media, PA, knows about it. They said they could not identify it.
