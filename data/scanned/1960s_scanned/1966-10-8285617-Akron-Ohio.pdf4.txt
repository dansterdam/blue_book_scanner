Dear Mrs. [Redacted],

Reference your letter of 1 November 1966 regarding your unusual observation. I am unable, at present, to reach a valid conclusion on your sighting, without essential data such as altitude, azimuth, flight characteristics, etc.

Request you complete the enclosed PTD Form 16b and resubmit the information to Project Blue Book for a more complete evaluation. 

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
