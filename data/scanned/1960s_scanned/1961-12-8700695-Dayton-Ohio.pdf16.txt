The image contains three sketches, but no photographs. 

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline) with an "A" marked on it, and an object above the horizon. The instructions ask to imagine the object was how high it appeared above the horizon when the observer first saw it.

The second and third sketches show larger scenes, with a person standing on a road in the middle of the image. The instructions ask to place an "A" and "B" at the positions where the object was first seen.
