Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I am a long distance traveler, usually by truck, and this new sighting was during a trip I was making. The sighting lasted for perhaps 2 or 3 minutes, and the object was as large as the full moon and appearing to stand still, hovering motionless in the sky. It seemed to be illuminated, glowing from within, and changing in color from white to orange and then red. When it started to move, it shot straight up and disappeared almost instantly. While there were no other sightings that I'm aware of, the rest of the trip was very uneventful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
