Flying Objects Zooming Over State
By BILL STEWART
A craft, described by witnesses as being the size of a car, glowing red, white and blue, was tracked on two radar screens only shortly before midnight, Saturday.
The Air Force base at Tinker Air Force base, "recovered" Oklahoma yesterday.
The first report, at 8:58 p.m., bid of a strange object moving at a reported speed of 600 to 800 miles an hour. The object, disappearing from radar screens, was reportedly picked up again by a radar tracker at 11:16 p.m.
One deputy, by deputy Sheriff O.C. Bridling, by radar operator JC Brown and Mrs. Marylette Tucker, saw the object for a few seconds. Sherriff Tucker said the glowing object came out of a cloud and headed a little more than a mile away, moving rapidly east.
The military radar tower at Tinker, within the range of 40 miles, reported the object at an altitude of 27,000 feet.
Base officials said "the were aware of the sightings but were not certain what the unidentified craft might be, and they were investigating the matter further."
