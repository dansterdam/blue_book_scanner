I was watching the TV at the time as usual. At 2135 I heard a strange noise outside and went to investigate. I saw a very bright white light about 300 yards away moving in a northeasterly direction at a slow speed. It appeared to be at a low altitude, possibly only a few hundred feet above the ground. The light remained steady and did not flicker. After observing it for about 2 minutes, it suddenly disappeared from view. There was no sound associated with the light and no exhaust or flames were visible. The night was very clear with excellent visibility. I have no explanation for what I observed and would be interested in any information you may have on similar sightings.
