The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text from an old UFO report document. As requested, I will proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the output of all the text found in the document, without any additional commentary.

"It is not impossible that by radio electronic means the problem of contact with intelligent beings elsewhere in the Universe will be solved."

Parlyskiy and Khaykin of Pulkowo in their review of the development of radio astronomy (1940-1952) do mention the problem of interstellar communications in a few lines, but put their faith in the international radio telescope discussed at a meeting of International Radio Union (Tokyo, 1963). No concrete program at Pulkowo or any other place in the USSR is mentioned.

Also nothing is said about observational programs in the detailed review article by L.M. Gindilis (1965), although the picture of the Pulkowo (see Appendix VI) radio telescope is given with a caption:

"Certain peculiar sources of radio emission that are suspected to be artificial have been investigated with this instrument."

This probably refers to sources STA-21 and STA-102, which were investigated on request from Kardashev (as discussed above), but not to any particular program of investigation.

The only practical approach to this problem would be the organization of a continuous radio survey of all objects within a certain distance, such as 1,000 light years, as indeed is recommended by the Byurakan Conference. This will be a gigantic program requiring monitoring some 10 million objects. Obviously an international cooperation is called for, especially so in the southern hemisphere.
