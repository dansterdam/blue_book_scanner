Here is the text from the document:

No Case (information Only)                7 March 1952
Bolton, Lancashire, England

Form revised
Date: 8 January 1952
Witness: Mr. Terence Wildbore
Address: 10 Crompton Street, Bolton
Occupation: Salesman
Report: Mr. Wildbore states that on 7 March 1952 at approximately 7:55 pm he was walking home from work when he observed a bright light in the sky traveling in a Southerly direction at a high altitude. The light was observed for about 3-4 minutes before disappearing from view. Mr. Wildbore described the light as being "disc-shaped" and "glowing white in color."
He indicated that the object was traveling at a very high rate of speed and made no sound. Mr. Wildbore stated that the object was much brighter than any star or aircraft light he had ever seen. He further stated that the object appeared to be traveling at an altitude of around 10,000-15,000 feet.
I enquired as to whether any other persons had observed the object, but Mr. Wildbore said he was alone at the time and did not mention it to anyone else until the following day.
It is my opinion that Mr. Wildbore's report appears genuine and he seemed sincere in his description of the object he observed. I can find no explanation for the phenomenon he described and I am therefore listing this as an "unknown."
