URGENTLIST LEAD FIRE-ALL CALLS 
ON SIGHTING OF FIRE FLASHING ACROSS THE HORIZON VIEWED BY MILITARY AIR FORCE PERSONNEL.

THE MESSAGE INDICATED A HIGHLY INTENSE LIGHT FLASHING ACROSS THE HORIZON NEAR SANTA ROSA ISLAND CALIFORNIA RECENTLY. A MILITARY OBSERVER AT A NIKE RADAR INSTALLATION ESTIMATED THE SPEED OF THE LIGHT OBJECT TO BE 4000 MILES PER HOUR OR MORE. HIS VISUAL ESTIMATE INDICATED AN OBJECT ABOUT 30 FEET IN DIAMETER.

OBSERVERS SAY THE BRIGHT FLASHING CAME MCC TO A SUDDEN STOP AND THEN TRAVELED BACK OVER THE HORIZON STRAIGHT UPWARD AT FANTASTIC SPEED.

METEOROLOGISTS AT LOS ANGELES STATED THERE WERE NO KNOWN METEORS, AIRCRAFT, OR OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENON REPORTED AT THE TIME. NATIONAL WEATHER Bureau REPORTED NO ACTIVITY OF THIS NATURE.

ALLIED FORCE AT CANLIFORNIA BASE NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY. NO U.S. ROCKET FIRINGS AT THIS TIME. THE FINANCE LIGHT WAS SEEN BY OTHER OBSERVERS IN THE AREA.

WERE NO U.S. ROCKET FIRINGS AT THE TIME. THE STRANGE LIGHT WAS SEEN BY SEVERAL OBSERVERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS BRIGHTER THAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUNLIGHT. IT SHOT STRAIGHT UP GAINING VERY RAPID SPEED.

CIVILIAN ASSUMPTION WAS A METEOR BREAKING UP AT LOW ALTITUDES. NO EXPLANATION IS OFFERED FOR THE SUDDEN STOP AND REVERSAL OF DIRECTION. SOME OBSERVERS FELT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SATELLITE OR SPACE VEHICLE ENTERING THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

(NOTE: SOME OBSERVERS CLAIMED IT RESEMBLED A "METALLIC MISSILE" AS IT PASSED BY THEM. MILITARY OBSERVERS STATED IT DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY KNOWN U.S. MISSILE OR AIRCRAFT.)

IT JUST LOOKED LIKE A PIECE TO BE MAY BE SEEN. "MAKES ANY THAT WAS SEEN." UNUSUAL COLORATION AND APPARENT BRIGHTNESS, COUPLED WITH VERY High SPEED AND SUDDEN REVERSAL OF DIRECTION, SUGGEST SOME TYPE OF ADVANCED AEROSPACE VEHICLE. FURTHER STUDY IS NEEDED, AS THIS EVENT IS COMPLETELY UNEXPLAINED.

GUT IT AS LISTED. THOUGH THE WEEK REPORT, STILL QUALIFY AS VERY SIGHT UNEXPLAINED SPARKS.
