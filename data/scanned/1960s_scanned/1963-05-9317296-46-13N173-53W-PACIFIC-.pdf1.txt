The image appears to contain a Project 10073 Record Card, which appears to be a document from the Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects. The card shows the date as 17 May 1963, and the location as 46-13N 173-53W (which is in the Pacific Ocean). The "Brief Summary of Sighting" indicates that the observer reported a "bright greenish white flare bursting into two orange flares descending from MATS 4 flight with 10 sec downward progression."
