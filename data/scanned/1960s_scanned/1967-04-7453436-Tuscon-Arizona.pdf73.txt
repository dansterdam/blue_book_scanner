27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object, and a "B" on the compass when you last saw it.

28. Draw a sketch that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course of travel.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?

Draw a sketch of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
