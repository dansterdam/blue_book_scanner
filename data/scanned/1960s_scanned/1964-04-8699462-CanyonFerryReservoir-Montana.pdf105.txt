EVANSTON, ILLINOIS

DEAR DR HYNEK,

I THINK YOU MAY BE INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT NEW MEXICO SIGHTING 
PATTERN OF THE SILS WERE NOT AS SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO WITH THE 
PHYSICAL IMPRESSION FOR HIS EXPERIENCE FOR THE DETAILS.

THOUGH THE CASES ARE NOT IDENTICAL, I CONSIDER IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU 
MAY WISH TO PURSUE FURTHER INFORMATION RELATIVE TO THE SOCORRO INCIDENT. 
THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE FILE INTELLIGENTLY. I CONSIDER IT ADVISABLE TO 
LEAVE IN THE FILE IN CASE PRIVATE CITIZENS OR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISH 
TO MAINTAIN CONTACT SUBSEQUENTLY.

I HAVE TALKED TO OFFICER ZAMORA AS WELL AS VISIT THE OBSERVATORY AT LAJIRA NCE HALL AND ALSO VISIT THE OBSERVATORY AT LAJIRA. OF COURSE, THERE ARE A POSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN ASCERTAIN THE DETAILS FROM THE CITY.
