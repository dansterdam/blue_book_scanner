I almost forgot this sighting we were having a family outside and noticed a bright light in the distance near the trees moving rather fast, it moved very strange from side to side and then stopped then moved some more then stopped again the light was very bright than it went out. I haven't thought much about this sighting since it happened but it certainly was strange the way it moved.
