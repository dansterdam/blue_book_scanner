There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing a diagram of a compass and instructions for the observer to sketch the sighting and indicate the movement of the object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
