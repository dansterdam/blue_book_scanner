The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an "A" marked on the curve. There are also several rays or lines extending from the bottom of the sketch, suggesting an object above the horizon.

The second sketch shows two larger scenes. The left scene depicts a rural landscape with buildings and trees, and a person standing in the foreground. The right scene shows a more distant landscape with mountains in the background and a small person silhouetted in the foreground.

As an OCR system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
