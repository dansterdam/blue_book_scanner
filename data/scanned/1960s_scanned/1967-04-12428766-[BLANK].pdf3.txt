April 12, 1967

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
USAF/FCIP
Headquarters FTD (AFSC)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Just a line to suggest that if you have a text of prepared remarks for the ASNE next week, and can get it mimeographed, it would be helpful to have a dozen or so copies for the press room at the Shoreham.

Not necessary, but it does insure that if the reporters want to quote you they will do so accurately.

Faithfully yours,
Newbold Noyes
Newbold Noyes, Jr.
