The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten text document, possibly a scanned page from an old UFO report document.

Mother followed a light last night to see if I could find it again. First it was small and distant, then as I got closer it seemed to grow larger, brighter and more distinct. When I got within 50 feet of it, it suddenly shot straight up, disappearing from sight in a few seconds. I was not able to make out any definite shape or form, it was just a bright light. When it took off, the light seemed to cover about 10 feet in height in less than a second. The light did not appear to be connected to or supported by any physical object.
