Dear -

Referring to your letter of May 9th and your telephone conversation of the 11th, I am enclosing herewith a photocopy of the information that was given to Mr. T.S. Elliott on the evening of April 5, 1962 in regard to the incident that occurred at 3:19 p.m. on April 4, 1962 in the Eureka, Utah-Rocky Mountain area. This information, which was gathered by members of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, was given to Mr. Elliott at his request.

I trust this will be the information you desire. If you require any additional assistance, please let me know.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
Assistant Director
