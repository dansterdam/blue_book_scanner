INVESTIGATING SUBCOMMITTEE
CHAIRMAN: Raymond E. Fowler 
2 Fairfield Court, 
Wenham, Massachusetts
Tel: 468-4811

WITNESSES(es): Patrolman C.L. Carapezza, Fellsway, Medford, Massachusetts

Others (names unknown) phoned into local Radio Stations

REPORT TO: WGBZ, Boston, Massachusetts

SIGHTING DESCRIPTION OF UFO:
Milkman heard a loud sonic booms and looked up to see not an aircraft but a parachute-shaped object moving slowly across the sky. Its shape was that of an egg or platter with a hazy gray color. The object made no sound and displayed no lights. It appeared to be approximately 50 feet in diameter. The witness stated that it looked like a parachute canopy without shroud lines and that it moved in a most deliberate manner. It was seen or heard in the vicinity. Others reported to WGBZ that a flash of light appeared in the sky.

Hanscom AFB UFO section repeated what they had heard on WGBZ but denied say firing anything about a balloon. They stated that balloon was responsible and that Hanscom AFB had previously launched its weather balloons. Phoned Air Force claimed that no regular Air Force activity had been engaged in at that time and that balloon at 7:57 AM.

U.S. Weather, Logan Airport, Boston informed me that the wind was NW at 15-25 mph. The balloon would have been carried southerly, agreeing approximately with the witnesses' observations. The sky was generally clear with scattered clouds observed.

EVAL. T.C.: The balloon was a Radio-Sonde type about 17' in diameter. The carrier package about 10' square is parachuted by a 2' parachute. At balloon burst the parachute must have appeared very low to have represented the sighting. Yet information indicates that at launch such a balloon could not be seen with the naked eye within minutes after launch.
