The image contains a sketch of an object that appears to be a UFO or some other unidentified aerial object. The sketch is a hand-drawn illustration and is accompanied by a questionnaire filled out by the observer.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? yes

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One) Yes No Don't know 
IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: silent
b. Color: brilliant white, fast moving
c. Size: uncertain
d. Number: 1

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the match the object would have covered. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the match would the object have covered?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the sketch to show the direction the object was moving.
