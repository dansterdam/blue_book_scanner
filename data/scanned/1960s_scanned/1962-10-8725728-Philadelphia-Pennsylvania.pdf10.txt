The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with instructions and questions for the observer.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path or "A" at the end of the earth, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick arm's length in line with a known object, such as a house or tree. If you had performed this at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the common object or objects which, when placed in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw.
