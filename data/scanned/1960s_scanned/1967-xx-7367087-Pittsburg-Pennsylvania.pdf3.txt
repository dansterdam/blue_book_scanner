Sirs:
The many books I have read say that when you see a UFO to report it. But what happened as I did is very curious.
I saw the object July 26, 1967 at close to 9:30 p.m. daylight saving time. The time zone was Eastern. I was at the address above. The object was in sight for some 15 minutes. It seemed that long. The object was in sight all the time. The condition of the sky was bright against there were no clouds. The weather was dry. The object appeared as a light. The object was so bright I could hardly look at it. There was a glare on the weather cap. The object appeared and disappeared at random times that night and into the early morning hours. I kept watching it because it fascinated me. At this time of year it is not even close or even on the horizon line. If it had changed appearance or very bright it seemed to become duller and duller on it. It was hazy or blurred and as I kept watching it became more and more distinct and looked as though it was still going or standing still. The object looked to stand still at Christmas, but this was silver or gray color. Then a red ball of fire then there were silver small about the size of pin heads objects near the Amole constellation. There seemed to move up and away at a good speed. Much faster then the red object did. As said before there were no clouds in the area and the time. There was no sound to the object or later objects. You can say how dry that came winter with no moisture. It was his enough that a dim would just cover it. I would say that the object had to be at least 5,000 feet or more. I spent up to two hours and some times more out at night. I have been with astronomy new 15 years. This object was at 30 degrees right overhead. If I had had a 35mm camera you would have some good pictures with this sighting.
