This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a historical document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page discusses physical evidence related to an unidentified object or light sighting, mentioning that the "lighting could be a reflection of some upper limit," and that the "length of time observed seems to possibly indicate an object of relatively large size." The text also refers to "Attachments 1 and 2," which are not visible in this image.

Here is the text output from the document:
