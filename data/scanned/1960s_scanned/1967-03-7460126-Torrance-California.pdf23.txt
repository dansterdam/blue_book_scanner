Transcription of the text in the document:

"It is extremely doubtful that these are the original negatives. However, if you forward us the original negatives and complete photographic data sheet, we will be glad to examine and comment on them.

The enclosed are the two negatives that you sent us and also a black and white enlargement of each.
