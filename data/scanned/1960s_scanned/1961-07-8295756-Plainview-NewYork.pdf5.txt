U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)
In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a brief description of the saucer description of the saucer observation. You may restate information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. They represent the details of the observation as they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

The text handwritten in the document states:
"The first sight of this event was a brilliant light in the southern sky accompanied by a peculiar sound when 3 round or airplanei got on the air craft. I picked up communications and noncollapsable craft appeared to me. It come over town a string of lights appeared and made a turn and went south where I could no longer see by naked eye so I went upstairs and saw a formation of more than six and made another observation that will be a separate account.
This time I will on my next report express more detailed and specific information which I gather and made than I have here. The sights on this first view were extremely startling and unnatural to any conventional aircraft observation that I have ever made or heard of."
