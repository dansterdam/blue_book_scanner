1. Forwarded is a copy of a police report from the Honolulu Police Department and an extract from the Base Disaster Control Division, APO 915, describing a UFO incident.

2. My own investigation made during the evening of 14 February 1964 revealed no unusual weather phenomena, no aircraft flying in the area in question during the time involved, no army activities in the adjacent military reservation and no disruption of power lines, etc. The sound was confirmed by Army S/A Kiley who told me he heard the sound through the telephone when Mrs. first called him.

3. The area in question is in the foot hills of the mountains, north of Honolulu. The neighborhood is characterized by small hills and valley, leading back several miles to the mountains. A highway runs through this area like a corridor.

4. I did find there was an accident on Likelike highway near where this incident occurred. The evening in question was also the last night of celebration of Chinese New Year.
