The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing a UFO sighting in Baltimore, Maryland on April 7, 1964.

Dear Sir:
History
                They seemed to be watching the journey of the car. when I had my binoculars again they were gone. This happened rapidly and seemed to indicate the ability to turn on and off some form of power (jet or rocket assisted). The object seemed to be cigar-shaped and changed from a point of light to a blurred outline and back again, maintaining the same general shape. I believe the object seen was not a distant star or planet because of the rapid changes from bright to dim and the ability to maneuver. It is difficult to give an accurate description. The report is based on what was observed by my 12-year-old son and myself in a rural area about 10 miles north of Baltimore early in the evening of April 7, 1964.
