10. AZIMUTH SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
During the course of carrying out routine duties in the LG area, I observed in the sky at about 20 degrees N of the horizon, a single object or vapour trail, brownish-yellowish in color, appearing and disappearing at intervals within a period of about a minute. The object was never sharply defined and appeared to consist of a succession of shape and color changes, none of which could be specifically described. The general impression was of an unidentified aerial phenomenon, possibly related to atmospheric conditions, which did not resemble anything previously experienced or reported.
11. COMMENTS
The object was observed by Cpt E.J. Jenson, who happened to be present and observed the same phenomenon. No further information or evidence was available.
