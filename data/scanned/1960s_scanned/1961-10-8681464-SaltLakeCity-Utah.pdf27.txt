What would you estimate the size to be?

Well, I would say somewhere between 35 and 50 ft. half again as wide as the wing span on the Moony?

What is the wing span on the Moony?
32 ft. It would be a good 50 ft across.
And how thick?

Well, I would guess about 8 ft. Maybe a little thicker than that in the center, but not much more than that.

In regard to the color, how would you describe that?
A gray, of course, the way I was looking toward the right part of the sky in the south and grayish along its light gray 'skin' as it moved on its southerly course.

Were there any, as compared to a manned aircraft, vapor trail, exhaust, etc?
Nothing that I could observe and I was looking closely for what because when it began to move it approached, it seemed to me much closer than I could see.

Did this have any of the characteristics of a manned aircraft such as wing section or tail section?
No wing section or tail section or any protruding surface out of this smooth circular disc-shaped surface.

Were there any parts such as exhaust pipes?
Couldn't see any portholes or any kind, no wings, nothing, but again I was looking through the flight path of the sky and it's possible that there were some that weren't visible.

Did you hear any sound at this time? 
No, I was in the airplane and of course my own engine was making enough noise that I wouldn't have heard anything outside it was considerably louder than my own.

At the closest point, at what angle was the object from you?
I would say about a 10° above my level and straight ahead, or relative bearing. 

You were flying south at the time?
I was flying on a 180° heading.

And that would be directly south?
Yes.
