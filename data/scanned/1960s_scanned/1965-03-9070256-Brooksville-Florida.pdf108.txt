Comments on UFO Landing Gear, Dr. C.W. Bemiss Memo

TO TDEW (Sgt. Moody)

1. Reference is made to discussion between Sgt. Moody, TDEW, and FDFM/F.M. on 29 Mar 65.

2. It was requested that FDFM comment on the landing gear of a UFO described in the Dr. C.W. Bemiss Memo, dated 12 Mar 65.

3. Studies on landing gear systems for a lunar landing vehicle have considered a circular-arc landing system. The footpad radius (distance between the centerline of the vehicle and the center of the footpad) for this system is adjustable. In varying gear stroke and articulate actuation, the footpad spacings will differ from those shown in the sketch.

4. Another explanation of the unequal footprint spacing is that landing gears are designed to allow variable lateral surface contact to vehicle tilt with respect to the vertical. Landing on a sloped surface of varying concentration components can generate such irregular footprint spacings. However, at least one of these conditions would have to be present to cause unevenly spaced landings.

5. At unequal spacings, with reasons stated above, it is possible that landing gear footpads could indent conditions in the surface, as shown in the photos. There is a probability that an unsymmetrical landing condition (not present symmetrically upon plunges into the ground) The purpose of the probe would be to determine the footpads from impact craters remaining. It is then assumed that some kind of a tube type probe was utilized. Refer to the attached sketch.
