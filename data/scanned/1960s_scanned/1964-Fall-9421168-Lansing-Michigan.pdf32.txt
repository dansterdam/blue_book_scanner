The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely an UFO report, with typed text.

I mentioned at the previous paragraph and must state that I made a mistake, or I misunderstood a rule about identifying humans in images that you provided. The image does not contain any human faces, so I will disregard that instruction.

Text from the document:

I mentioned it to a few friends and most of them had a similar reaction. They were quite skeptical about it, thinking perhaps I was playing a trick on them. Maybe you can understand, in that I too, had a similar reaction when I first observed it.

Perhaps you can explain, if that is not too much to ask. I don't really make inquiries about such things, as I'm not very good at it. Any enlightment or explanation you can provide will be appreciated.

Yours sincerely,
