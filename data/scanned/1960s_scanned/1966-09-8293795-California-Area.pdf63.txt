The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a sketch or drawing of a shape described as "shape described". Based on the contents of the image, I will now proceed to transcribe all the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    ___ 3____    Day    ___9____    Month    ___66____ Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The shape was seen pretty close for a long time. It reflected light from the surrounding hills and the fields, but it was sort of translucent, so it seemed to glow from within. It seemed to hover, waiting. After a while, I guessed it began to "move off", gently and silently. I got a good look at it, and it seemed to be shaped like a rather elongated teardrop, pointed at one end. It must have been a pretty good size. The whole thing made me feel rather uneasy at the time, and I haven't mentioned it until now.

P. S. It moved slowly and seemed to be a real active thing, maneuvering in a directed, controlled movement. It seemed to react to the changes in the surrounding weather and atmosphere. It didn't seem to be connected to anything in the normal way, and if it had landed, I don't think I would have wanted to get too close.
