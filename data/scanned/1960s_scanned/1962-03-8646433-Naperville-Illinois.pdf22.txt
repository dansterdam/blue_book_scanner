RADAR OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

On 8 March 1962, at approximately 2010 hours, personnel at the Naperville, Illinois radar facility observed an unidentified object on their radar screens. The object was first detected at a range of approximately 40 miles and was tracked for over 20 minutes as it traversed an irregular flight path at an estimated speed of 1500 miles per hour. The object did not appear on any other nearby radar installations and was not observed visually by ground personnel. Analysis of the radar data indicates the object exhibited characteristics consistent with a solid, metallic craft. No further details are available.
