The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to the United States Air Force from a person in Brooklyn, New York. The letter describes observing a satellite-like object passing overhead at approximately 9:35 P.M. on July 30, 1961. The writer asks the Air Force to identify which satellite was observed, as the newspapers do not have any information about it. The letter is signed by the writer with their address in Brooklyn, New York.

Gentlemen:

On Sunday, July 30, 1931, my friend and I spotted a moving object in the sky. It was moving in a northeasterly direction. We have already seen the Tyros satellite and we know this was a satellite of some sort. The satellite passed over at approximately 9:35 P.M.

Would you please tell us which satellite we saw? We called the newspapers but they know nothing about it.

Very truly yours,
