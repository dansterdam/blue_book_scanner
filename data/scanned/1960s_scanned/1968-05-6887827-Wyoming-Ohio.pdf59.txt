There is a photograph present in the image. It appears to be a diagram or sketch with an illustration of a compass or navigation device. The image also includes some text instructions related to evaluating the position and motion of an unidentified object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "A" on the dot to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the dot to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on "60Â°" on the compass where you think you saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a sketch of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
