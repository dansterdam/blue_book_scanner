There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten document, likely an old report from Project Blue Book. I will now act as an OCR system and transcribe the text found in the document:

"I decided to get up, and as I glanced out the window, I saw a red light on a piece of ground very close to my house. It was at first very bright, and then suddenly it went out. A few minutes later it appeared again, but this time it was not as bright. I watched it for about 30 minutes, and then this red light suddenly got brighter and brighter, and then it went out again. 
I continued to watch the object, and all of a sudden it appeared to move very rapidly, and then it just disappeared. I continued to watch the object, and then I decided to look out of another window to see if I could see it. I was unable to locate the object.
I felt a little uneasy about the whole thing, and I called a few of my friends to see if they had seen anything, but none of them had. I continued to watch for the object, but I was unable to locate it again.
I would like to compare this incident with other similar incidents that have been reported, and I would be interested to know if there have been any other reports of a similar nature in this area. I am quite certain that what I saw was not an airplane, and I am also certain that it was not a satellite or a meteor. I would be interested in any information that you could provide on this subject."
