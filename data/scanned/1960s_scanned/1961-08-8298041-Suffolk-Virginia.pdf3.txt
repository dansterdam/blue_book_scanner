III. SUMMARY:
On 12 August 1961, the reporting officer visited the residence of Mrs. H.R. to further investigate the alleged sighting of unidentified flying objects. The officer stated that the objects were described as being approximately 8 to 10 inches in diameter, and that Mrs. R. stated she could not see any body. However, she did agree that the body and hands had been seen before. Mrs. R. stated that the objects were seen for approximately 2 hours, and that both she and her husband had observed the objects. She stated that the color of the objects was similar to that of a phosphorescent glow, and that there were no exhausts, sound, or trails, though the objects appeared to move slowly from the north-east to the south-west while circling with an elevation of 75 degrees.

Mrs. R. stated that her nephew is troubled with what appears to be a nerve problem, and when they developed the film, the negatives showed a blurred image, and she felt this was not normal. The circles she described were approximately 350 degrees with an elevation of about 75 degrees.

Other witnesses included an eight year old girl and her mother. They stated that the daughter came in the house and told her mother about the objects; however, she was only able to observe them for a short time as they were disappearing.
