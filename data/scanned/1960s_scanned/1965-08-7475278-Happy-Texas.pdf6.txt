On 7 July 1965, this office received a report of an unidentified flying object 
sighting near Happy, Texas. Witnesses reported seeing a white-colored object 
with red and green lights, hovering and maneuvering in the sky. The object was 
described as being approximately 30 feet in diameter. It was seen for several
minutes before disappearing from view.

Investigators were dispatched to the sighting area but were unable to locate any
physical evidence or additional witnesses. The report has been forwarded to 
Project Blue Book for further analysis.
