33. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

For this I give a report of my own sighting which took place at Bergenfield, New Jersey, on the evening of June 8, 1966. At about 9:45 pm I was outside, and observed a bright light in the western sky. This light was observed for about one and one-half to two minutes, during which time it seemed to pulse and change color. The object then moved off to the north at a rapid rate of speed, going out of sight in less than a minute.

The object appeared round or circular in shape, and seemed to be about the size of a full moon. The light itself was very bright, white, and pulsing or flashing in intensity. Colors of red, blue, and green also seemed to be present at times.

The object was observed both by myself and my wife, and was at an estimated altitude of perhaps 2000 to 3000 feet. No sound was heard. The night was clear, with only a few scattered clouds.

This is the most unusual object I have ever observed in the sky. I have no explanation for its nature or origin. I am reporting this sighting in the hope that it may be of some interest or value to your investigation of unidentified flying objects.
