Transcription of the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curve where the object was above the horizon at (azimuth) when you first saw it. Place an "0" on the curve where the object was above the horizon at (azimuth) when you last saw it. Draw a line connecting the "X" and "0" that will show the path that the object or objects made. Place an arrow at the beginning of the path, a "+" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Indicate that in the sketch by placing them in their relative positions to show the direction they were moving.
