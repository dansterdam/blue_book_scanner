UFO Sighting of 17 April 67 Near Jefferson City, Missouri

1. Reference your letter of 24 April 1969 regarding a conversation between you and Mr. J. A. Quintalilli of 17 April concerning the UFO sighting of 17 April 1967 near Jefferson City, Missouri. You brought to the attention of this office the fact that the Project Blue Book office is the fall of 1968; and although the quality of the recording was poor, it appears that several portions that have a bearing on the analysis of the UFO sighting. For instance, Mr. Quintalilli's statement that the object was at a lower altitude than his aircraft and his statement that the object was a lower altitude than his aircraft and was a "larger craft than the aircraft stated that the object was not moving at a high speed, but to the best of Lt Marano's recollection approximately to the best of his memory.

2. Both the statements that the object passed almost over the Jefferson City Municipal Airport and that the pilot of the incoming aircraft sighted the object are unsupported by the testimony of the witnesses and the evidence submitted to the official investigation. Therefore, if your trip or so much as possible of the conversation, the tape will be returned to you unedited along with a copy of the transcript.
