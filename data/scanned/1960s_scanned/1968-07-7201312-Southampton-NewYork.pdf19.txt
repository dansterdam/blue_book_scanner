The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

SUMMARY
State your own personal evaluation of the report. What do you think the object was? Do you think something other than the sighting may have led to the caller's evaluation of the object?

(Handwritten text)
I believe this to be a legitimate report - very well described and evaluated by the observer. The object fits the description of the "typical" UFO, ie: a fairly large, metallic, disc-shaped object with lights. The observer's evaluation seems unbiased and completely reasonable. Although no photographs were taken, the detailed observation and description provided lend credibility to the report.
