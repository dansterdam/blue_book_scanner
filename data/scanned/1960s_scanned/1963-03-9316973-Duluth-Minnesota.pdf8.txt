10 March 1963
Duluth, England

Time: 1.45

Weather: Fair, calm.

Narrative: At approximately 1.45 am on 10 March 1963, a civilian observer sighted an unidentified flying object over Duluth, England. The object was described as circular in shape, of a dull greyish color, and approximately 100 feet in diameter. No details on the object's altitude or flight path were provided. The observer reported the sighting to the local authorities.

Our position in this matter is that there is nothing in the report which indicates any threat to national security or evidence of extraterrestrial activity. We do not believe that further investigation is warranted at this time.
