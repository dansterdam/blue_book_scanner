SUBJECT: UFO Investigation

1. ... was contacted by telephone at 1900 on 17 Nov 69. He related and supplements the original letter and drawing sent by ... That he stated that the object he saw was a UFO. ... The facts, while not positively identifying the object, suggest that his story is at best, doubtful.

2. Assuming Roder's elevation angle of 50 Degrees is correct, and using the stated estimate of 1000+ feet for the object's height, then the object would have been approximately 1200 feet away. If we assume it was 1000 feet away, then it would take a basketball to cover the object along the line of sight. ... (1360 is more accurate), ... "a tree or house across the street."

3. By greatest contrast, lies in the fact that apparently no one else saw (or reported having seen) this UFO, other than Roder. This is in contrast to the reports of Office of Chicago ARTCC and Chief Stewart of Glenview Public Affairs (Navy counterpart) who stated both previously and on 23 or 25 October that some unidentified object had been tracked both visually and on radar by the Chicago ARTCC and themselves.

4. The obvious discrepancies concerning velocity of the object and time observed (stated 65 minutes in letter and 90 minutes on the telephone)...

5. In conclusion, while the investigator thought he was seeing a UFO, it is the opinion of this investigator that he was the victim of his own vivid imagination or some other natural phenomenon.
