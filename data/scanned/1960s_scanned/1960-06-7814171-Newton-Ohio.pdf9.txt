No Case (Information Only)
June 1960 
England

An incident, EVIDENTALLY of LANDING a LARGE object in ENGLAND, recently came to the attention of Project BLUE BOOK through an investigator in England. Mr. Bill (?) Edwards was talking to an elderly man who lived near the scene of the incident and who claimed to have seen a bright light descending over his field the night of 25 May I960. This same man saw an object land in a field about a quarter of a mile away, and put out a bright light. The object then rose again, at which time the man could distinguish one could two individuals on board through what seemed to be a transparent window.

The width of the imprint was about 25 feet, and the inner one is 7 feet across. The object then rose and went away. The witnesses reported that they were "caused by a large heavy circular object which had landed", and the effects were still visible on the ground.

In investigating, it was found that a fresh crop of horse mushrooms had grown in this area, and that the field in question is about a half mile in diameter. There were no other unusual signs or markings. Edwards had been to the site a day previously, and had found no evidence of any other 'landing'. Continuing, the report states that this case is still being investigated, but that it would seem to be an isolated incident; and that no other unusual occurrences were reported in this area during this period.
