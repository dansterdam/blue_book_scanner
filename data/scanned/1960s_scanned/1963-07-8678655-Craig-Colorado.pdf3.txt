On July 8, 1963 Craig, Colorado - Officers Vald ow and It were on our way to 137 home after we returned to the office. At 3:34 we saw an object apparently hovering over the southeast hill, it appeared to be luminous and moving significantly, at a northeast direction - a few minutes later at 3:48 am it was perfectly still and oval shaped, seemed to be about 40 feet long with lights all around it, we watched it for about 20 minutes, then it suddenly accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared, there were no other cars around, the night was clear and we observed it thoroughly - the object was only silhouetted, between the lights, no details were noticed - no noise or anything heard, other than the sounds of the car - we intend to submit a report to the project blue book.
