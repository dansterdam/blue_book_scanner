1. (S) The information included in YEA message COND/NO FORM/DI: 
03227 was reviewed, and the following comments are submitted:

2. (C) The data as submitted does not provide adequate analysis
of individual manifestations on the radar scope and normal
interferance effects are not discussed. Without such analysis,
in assessing the situation.

3. (C) The overall situation, as a whole, several facts
appear obvious on the face of the report:
a) Where visual observation are credible, they provide
confirmatory evidence that unusual real objects were clearly
visible to observers. This would substantiate that if physical
objects are detected on the radar, those detections are valid
(This is supported by the number of witnesses co-locating the
same visual and radar target).
b) The fact that rapid maneuvering was observed, as indicated
by the report, would suggest that the objects detected were not
normal aircraft under controlled flight. Such maneuvering
would be indicative of advanced flight capabilities beyond
normal aircraft performance.
c) The fact that the objects were observed to approach and
depart the vicinity at high speed, as stated, would also suggest
advanced flight characteristics considerably beyond current
aircraft performance.
It is reasonable that maintenance of the classification
status on the details of this incident is prudent, as release
of this information could be prejudicial to national interests.
