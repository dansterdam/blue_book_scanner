Transcription of the text in the document:

It appears that it must have been some kind of a phenomena in the sky. There is something that I cannot quite explain. It seemed to appear from a distance of approximately 3 miles. At first it appeared to be coming from the horizon in a horizontal movement. As it moved across the eastern sky, near the zenith, it seemed to oscillate up and down and side to side. During this movement, it appeared to expand and contract in size. At times it seemed to halt or hover briefly, and at other times it would appear to move at a high rate of speed. After maneuvering in this fashion for several minutes, the object suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared in a westerly direction. I noticed that the craft had a round shape with a bright illuminated undersurface, without any visible means of propulsion. The light seemed to emanate from the entire body of the craft, as though the craft were moving without any exhaust light or trail. After the craft had disappeared, I remained motionless and continued to scan the sky for a few additional minutes in hopes of seeing it again, but it did not reappear.
Sincerely,
