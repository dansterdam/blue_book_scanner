The image contains two illustrations. The first illustration is a sketch that shows an object's path in relation to the observer's location, with instructions to mark the first sighting point, the object's path, and any changes in direction. The second illustration is a compass rose diagram.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show the same curved line to show the highest point you saw it. Place a "C" on the same curved line to show the point on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
