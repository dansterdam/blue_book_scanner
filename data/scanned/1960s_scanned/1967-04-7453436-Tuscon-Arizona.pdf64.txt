The image contains a diagram with instructions for sketching the motion of a reported UFO object. There is a compass-like diagram in the top right showing the directions, and a graph in the lower half showing the path of the object. The instructions ask the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object and any changes in direction during its course.

The text in the document reads:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.

Only 1 object
