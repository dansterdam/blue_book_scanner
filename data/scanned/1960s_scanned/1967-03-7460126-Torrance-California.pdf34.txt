Project: Denebola. Sr.
S.A.F. 67
22 Mar to June 20. 2030

Dear Sir:

Project Denebola - Request for assistance in investigating an alleged unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting reported by Airman First Class Denebola on 22 March 1967 near Torrance, California.

A detailed written statement from Airman Denebola describes his observation of a large, luminous, disc-shaped object that hovered in the sky for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing. Airman Denebola's account suggests the object exhibited characteristics not consistent with known aircraft.

I would appreciate your review of this report and any recommendations you may have for further investigation of this incident. Please advise.

Sincerely,
