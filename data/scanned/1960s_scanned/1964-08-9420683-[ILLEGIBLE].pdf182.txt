ASTRONOMY

Saturn Now Prominent

Dense, directly overhead, is one of four bright stars visible this month, and the planet Saturn, Mars, Venus and Mercury are the other three. By JAMES STOKLEY
THE PLANET SATURN is now shining brightly in the southern skies, making it easy to identify. It is visible in the evening, soon after darkness falls, and can be seen for several hours. Charts accompanying maps show its location to the southeast of some well-known stars.
This is the time of year when Saturn appears directly overhead, not far from the celestial equator. Since it is now at opposition, meaning it is on the opposite side of the earth from the sun, it is visible most of the night. Saturn now stands well above the horizon both at sunset and at sunrise. In fact, it will be with us for the rest of the year - although it may be difficult to see it clearly because of the late autumn and winter haze near the horizon.
The light from Saturn now appears very bright, since the planet is closer to the earth than it has been since June, 1952. At that time Saturn was about 745 million miles away. On Aug. 22 it will be 793 million miles out. That's still a long distance, but Saturn is much more prominent in the sky than it has been in a long time.
On Aug. 22, at 8:17 p.m. EDT, the sun will be setting, twilight will have faded, and Saturn will shine with steady brilliance, high in the southern sky. The planets Jupiter, Venus and Mars will also be visible, marking the beginning of autumn in the sky, as indicated in the Celestial Time Table. But the standout of the evening sky will be Saturn, the ringed planet shining brightly, one of the most beautiful objects in the heavens.
