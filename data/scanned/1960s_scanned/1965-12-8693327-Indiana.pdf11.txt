The image appears to be a handwritten document, likely a page from a Project Blue Book report. There is no photograph present in this image. 

The text in the document is as follows:

"Dear Captain, Attached is my copy of the incident report and made four photographs of the object. The object remained visible for a 122 millisecond time or fifteen seconds. The object was taken approximately 45 second after my initial observation. The sound disappeared after my first observation for 5-5 seconds, the object at a minute and ten seconds, and then lasted for a minute and 20 seconds. The photographs made are un-retouched and unaltered, from the four by five inch negatives, of the object."
