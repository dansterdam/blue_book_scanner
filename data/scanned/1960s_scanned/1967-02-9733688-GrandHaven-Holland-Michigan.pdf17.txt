Greysen by about this time had put on his jacket and hat. He had been outside for perhaps thirty seconds, when he cought be took to be the same object, but this time at a bearing of 3 to 4 degrees, consideded [sic] from a position almost straight above. His impression was that the object appeared suddenly. During this time, he was watching his object to be slightly more north of sight, definitely divergen t [sic] from an earlier position, and therefore he was observing a different object, but still possibly not Venus unless he lost sight of the original that was still on Hilliey. The lines of sight of the object were estimated to be at a height of from about 3000 to 1500 feet, at Grand Haven and out over Lake Michigan. The distance was estimated to be a short distance, four or five miles in distance of interaction, mostly due to lack of clearance landmarks. This line had to be within two or correct since the road to South Haven to 118th Ave. is circa 200 yards to the west. Size of the object for a considerable stretch; the road made full observation of the object, making due west and then slightly southeast of area being a telephone pole, to establish a line of sight to the object. Five degrees to the left and no more than three to four degrees above the horizon (feeling roughly) and no more than three to four degrees above the horizon (horizon ceiling level). At this point, he was looking about for say degrees to the left and right, trying to determine actual elevation of the object from the horizon.
