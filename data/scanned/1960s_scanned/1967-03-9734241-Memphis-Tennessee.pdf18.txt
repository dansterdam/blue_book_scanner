A was watching T.V. with him, & called what I saw. a u.f.o. with him, & he said it looked like stars, moving around. call it what I may of the 5-15-65 time, reverse, & it took off and went out in sight, & can't make out what it is, so I will describe it as an unusual sight, & would not be surprised at all, if it could be several members & lights on the same.
