11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer originally wrote that he had "seen another flying saucer" on 31 July 68. A form 117 was sent to the observer to complete. The data given on the form is insufficient and is unable to be evaluated. At best the report appears to be a close sighting of an object which may have been a UFO on 31 July 68.
