There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

10. IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE PHENOMENON, HOW MANY WERE THERE? DRAW A PICTURE TO SHOW HOW THEY WERE ARRANGED. DID THIS ARRANGEMENT CHANGE DURING THE SIGHTING?

11. CONDITIONS (Check appropriate blocks)
A. DAY [ ], NIGHT [V], CLEAR [ ], CLOUDY [V], HAZY [V], FOG OR MIST [ ], HEAVY RAIN [ ], LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE [V], HAIL [ ], SNOW [ ], UNKNOWN [ ], NONE OF THE ABOVE [ ]
B. CUMULUS CLOUDS (Low fluffy), CIRRUS CLOUDS (High feathery or hairline), STRATUS CLOUDS (Flat base and ragged edges), NIMBUS CLOUDS (Rain)
C. IF THE SIGHTING WAS AT TWILIGHT OR NIGHT, WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE STARS AND MOON?
(1) STARS [ ], MOON [V], A FEW [V], MANY [ ], UNKNOWN [V]
(2) MOON WITH HALO [ ], MOON OBSCURED BY CLOUDS [V], PARTIAL (New or quarter) [V], FULL [ ], UNKNOWN [ ]
D. IF THE SIGHTING WAS IN DAYLIGHT, WAS THE SUN VISIBLE? (IF "YES," WHERE WAS THE SUN AS YOU FACED THE OBJECT?)
IN FRONT OF YOU [ ], IN BACK OF YOU [ ], OVERHEAD (Near zenith) [V], UNKNOWN [ ]
E. SPECIFY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS OR STREETLIGHTS, ETC. MOON AND STARLIGHT WERE PRESENT.
F. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT WAS SOLID OR TRANSPARENT, WHETHER EDGES WERE SHARP OR FUZZY, DESCRIBE THE SHAPE AND INDICATE IF IT CHANGED. COMPARE OBSERVED OBJECTS WITH FAMILIAR OBJECTS LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR THE MOON.

The observer described a bright light that seemed to suddenly appear, with a fixed, steady glow and no pulsating or strobing. It was initially bright enough to light up the surrounding area, and appeared to be a bright, round, luminous object or light in the sky. The object itself was not seen, only the light it emitted. The light gradually dimmed over a period of some minutes until it faded from view. No sounds were heard, and there were no other observed phenomena.
