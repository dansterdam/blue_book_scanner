was in Mr. Reeves a complete unconcern about the Porphyrin tests outcome. It is my opinion therefore, that he was truthfully telling in all respects.
Further corroboration was obtained from the handwriting studies of Mr. John F. Reeves obtained March 14, 1965 relative to his character. From the examination of his writing it is my opinion that he is a man who gives serious attention to details and does not reflect an extreme degree of aggressiveness in his attitude and he has a I don't care attitude regarding what others might think about him. Generally he is not too talkative and considers actions carefully as well as philosophical thinking. He has determination but his enthusiasm is not of long endurance. He has a practical nature and no indication of being credulous.

The letter puts an entirely different light on the purported polygraph test supposedly recorded by Life magazine. It also leaves no doubt that Mr. Reeves is a respectable, honest man of normal temperament and thinking.
