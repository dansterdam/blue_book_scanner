Text extracted from the document:

AF IN : 46289

K. EDWARD J. GRENIC, CAPTAIN, USAF, UFO INVESTIGATING OFFICER, RECEIVED THIS REPORT ON THE 3RD OF APRIL 1967, 10 DAYS AFTER THE SIGHTING OCCURRED. CAPT KIER WITH THE PEORIA AIR NAT'L GUARD IS CONDUCTING A RECORDS CHECK OF AIR OPERATIONS IN THE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING AREA. THIS REPORT SHOULD BE RECEIVED BY THE 6TH OF APRIL 1967. AS OF NOW, NO FIRM DETERMINATION CAN BE MADE, SINCE THE SALE'S RESIDENCE LIES ON THE AIRWAY, AND SINCE THE PEORIA VOR APPROACH PROCEDURE TURN WOULD BE OVER THIS AREA AT AN ALTITUDE OF 1200 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, I STRONGLY SUSPECT THIS TO BE AN AIRCRAFT. THE LOW CEILING AND VISIBILITY WOULD CAUSE REFLECTED LIGHT TO BE MISINTERPRETED. THE INVESTIGATION WILL CONTINUE, AND THE CONTENTS OF THE REPORT FROM CAPT KIER WILL BE FORWARDED.
