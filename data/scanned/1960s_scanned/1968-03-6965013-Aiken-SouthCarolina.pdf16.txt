Project Blue Book
Wright - Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Monday night, March 25 at 6:50 p.m. the U.F.O. was sighted on the area of Jackson's Gap, Alabama at 6:55 p.m.

The object was bright lights changing in color and seemed to be accelerating. After it reached a point where it could be seen through the fog, it left a red tail looking at it. We went to the area it was spotted in and we heard strange noises almost like static. Please send information at what you think about it.

The U.F.O. was spotted again the next night in the northwest.

P.S. Please send information.
