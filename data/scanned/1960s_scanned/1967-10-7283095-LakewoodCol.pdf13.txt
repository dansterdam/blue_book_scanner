mysterious death of a pony near Alamosa, Colorado. Several incidents were also reported involving pranks by college students who attempted to create illusions by sending objects aloft at night.

a. The investigating officer visited the area of the reported sighting and attempted to reconstruct the reported incident with the following results:

(1) With the vehicle driver's attention distracted for a moment, a person standing three feet from the vehicle on the driver's side can easily disappear from view.

(2) To observe an object the size of a football field the driver would have to lean far out of the window or well forward to see out of the windshield, at which point the object, depending on the height, would be many yards to the north of the intersection.

d. Mr. ****** appeared rational and sincere during the interview. He was quite adamant on particular points of his story. He had been contacted by the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) and his statements as to the method of propulsion seemed colored by the book discussion APRO had given him. He stated that APRO had told him propulsion was similar to that of magnetic levitation or ionic propulsion. Mr. ****** was receptive to suggestion when approached with leading questions, and although he stated he was suspicious of the incident, he did not smoke or drink.

Mr. ****** seems to be moderately receptive to suggestion when approached with leading questions, and although he stated he was suspicious of the incident, he did not smoke or drink.
