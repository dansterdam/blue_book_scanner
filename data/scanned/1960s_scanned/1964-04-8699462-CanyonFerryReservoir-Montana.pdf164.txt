The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing a UFO sighting over the Canyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana in 1964.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Now, after sighting this object, and several others, (large ones) and many small ones, I am going to really try and think back over a year ago for the first time, and would like to explain the history.

Sighting it every night, and watching it, and seeing an erratic pattern, so you may consider continuing a little, but I shall try and be as simple, and as plain as I can be.

If you only knew, however, you may want, please remember MY OWN time is VERY LIMITED. But that some good, and may be you can take over after I go out to work for my daily wages. 

I have lived all my life in Sacramento, California. I now live at Pleasanton, California, and still see the objects.

One large one, over the year has changed the pattern of flight, and when I say, I could show rather than tell. 

I have counted as many as three, from the same general area, arising in one night.

a lot of my co-workers at General Motors, have also sighted these.

They did not have the same thing happen to them, as they did not care as much as I do. It does not look like that.

It moves slowly, and must be watched, constantly as and compared to a stationary object, like the roof on T.V. to see.

Recently having moved to Pleasanton, I have shown several people through a pair of 7x50 binoculars. Another object, (large) the same kind as I muse at the plant at times. This is not the same one.

altho a scope or binoculars are not needed, to see this. I shall fill the form out, and if you would like to take any gases, please feel it is any further information, for ever required.

P.S. I have heard of several other sightings over near Santa Cruz, California, area, but the same more lower and shorter. Strictly hearsay.
