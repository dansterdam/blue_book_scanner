The text of the document is as follows:

"Craft of any type.  I also do not believe that what I saw was a meteor or a bolide.  My reasons for this are as follows:
Just traveiied amazingly with the ground; the speed was too slow for a meteor; there was no sound of an explosion; the lighted object left no trail that was perceptible as it passed.  If here you will send me your explanation of the object or one acknowledging my sighting and/or your inability to identify it.

Thank you."
