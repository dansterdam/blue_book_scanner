In Re to Item 10: I observed this object first as a yellow light, much closer than any light. At times it would emit colored lights, to wit: pinkish-red. I would describe it as comparing it to the on top of a police cruiser. Observing the object through binoculars it appeared to have a very brilliant light. It would compare this light and its intensity to such a firing which is occasionally hit by a spotlight at make this comparison from fishing at night with. Jewelry. 

In Re to Item 11: I used the binoculars on the moon and that I could see in the sky, and then would go back to when Williamson set it on the astronomer's telescope, it appeared to be all blue-white, but more white than blue.

In Re to Item 13: I answered this with a modified Yes test appeared to come closer to the earth in a motion that best describe as comparable to a weighted parachute coming down. This comparison is backed on my experience from the army. I also lined up the object with a telephone pole so that we were all a straight line. The object went to the top of the pole and to the right of the pole and traveled up and down in a particular night was extremely and crisp. The Milky Way was prominent and quite obvious.
