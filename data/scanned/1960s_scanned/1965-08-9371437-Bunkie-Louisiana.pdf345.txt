There appears to be no photograph or image in the provided document. The document appears to be a letter written by "Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Chief, Project Blue Book, USAF (TDPY)" to an unnamed recipient, discussing topics related to UFO sightings and investigations.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sir:

Concerning your letter of December 20, 1965, on the subject of unidentified flying objects. I have reviewed the subject of undidentified flying objects. I have reviewed the subject of unidentified flying objects and cannot submit the copy of my report and photos you asked for, as they are many, and many of these would not be reported since so many are without sufficient substantiation to warrant submittal. 

As you will learn from your file, all objects reported to Project Blue Book have been investigated, and the initial scientific fashion possible has been undertaken in their investigation, groups, among them the Condon Committee and Valentich, Robert E. for their disappearance and deaths, I can not submit the originals, for they disappeared and remain at their last known location with me. If you wish to know anything about the objects that I have not affirmatively unidentified, I will be unlikely to talk with your people.

Respectfully yours,
(Miss) ___
