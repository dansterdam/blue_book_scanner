7. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer noted a silver-colored object about 25 feet in diameter with a blinking red light on the front and a blue light on the rear. The object was viewed through binoculars and was observed to be motionless. Photographs were taken but do not show the object clearly. It appears that the object observed, if any, was probably a balloon or some other natural phenomenon.
