The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

The text in the document is as follows:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
MOVE STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE? 
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

A neighbor was walking to my home and sighted the object.

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
IT FADED AWAY

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING? (IF SO, IT MAY HAVE DESCRIBED)
