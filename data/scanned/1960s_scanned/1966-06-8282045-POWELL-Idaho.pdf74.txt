The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document with text describing various photographic analysis techniques used in Project Blue Book, such as double printing, double exposure, and recording the basic scene and waiting until lights are extinguished. The text provides detailed technical information about the methods used to analyze these types of photographic evidence.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 66-14, DATED 16 NOVEMBER 1966

There are several methods by which this photograph could have been used. These methods could have been used singly or in combination:

a. Possible printing technique, utilizing a positive transparency in register over the negative.

b. Double exposure technique by first photographing the basic scene then pointing the camera at a black background and somehow randomly moving a small light source across the field of view to produce a continuous motion picture type shutter effect.

c. Recording the basic scene and waiting until lights 1, 4, 2, and 5 are extinguished and then placing one or several small light sources randomly behind the camera. Several extremely similar patterns exist in frame 1, strongly suggesting that this method has been used.

Frame #2 - This appears to have been done with two separate exposures, possibly from two different locations.

Traings 1, 2, 3, and 4 are identical in general shape differing only in width. This indicates that they were produced by the same source, presumably a small light or lighted object, moving or rotating rapidly so as to produce these traces. The two "traces" numbered "12" are identical and appear to constitute a mirror image of the others, suggesting a symmetrical arrangement or possibly a reflection.

Frame #3 - This appears to have been multiple exposures, possibly an intentional double or multiple exposure to produce the identical traings labeled as "3" in the print, indicating that at least four distinct exposures were made.

Frame #4 - Within this area marked "1" is a microscopic examination of the negative reveals what appears to be and possibly are images of the moon, again indicating multiple exposures were used.

There are time markings and possibly time indications on the film, which could be utilized to correlate the stated times with the actual exposure times. This photograph could be duplicated.
