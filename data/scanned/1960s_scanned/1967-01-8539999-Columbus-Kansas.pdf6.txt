Dear Sirs:

We are writing this letter to inform you of our sighting of an unidentified flying object on the 18th day of January 1967, when a friend of mine and I were outside getting some water out of his car, when all at once we heard a strange noise. We looked around and didn't think anything about it, until later on the same night someone called and he said that he had noticed several U.F.O.'s. We started talking about the strange noise, that he sighted an U.F.O. and said the strange noise, the things we had heard might have been the strange noises. The strange noise were confirmed by two other people. We would like for you to have any information that you could send us.

Thank you for your time and patience.
