There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

6 years- this article is the result of a five year long investigation. The sightings are to near menomone fall's. They were visible for awhile, visible from 15 to 20 & around & visible from menomone falls. These may have been ufo's. They were irregular in shape, about 2 - 3 & appeared to move around, (a rather suggestive) That may have been a plane or something else the investigator is not sure. the sighting was on a clear night about 10 pm. it left no noise trail that he has detected before.
the intensity of these, my size of these may have compare to the familiar in an average night's sky in this vicinity. It did not appear to move in this travel.

I hope these were not a rarity - most uncommon!

Carefully yours
