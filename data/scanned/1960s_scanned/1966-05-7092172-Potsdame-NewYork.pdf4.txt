Details of Complaint or Incident: (LIST EXACT WORDS AS SHOWN)
"The witness, who was station south of the road at the apparent UFO sighting and looking north, stated he saw a bright object coming in over the road from the northeast. He said it was traveling at a high rate of speed and was oval in shape. The object, which was reddish in color and emitting a bright light, seemed to hover near a factory in the area and then proceeded to go quickly out of sight when it appeared to accelerate further. The witness reported he had a better sighting for about a minute and a half, when the object seemed to be low and close to the ground, and he could see the shape and lighting clearly. The object continued its acceleration and left the area. No noise was heard by the witness during the sighting."
