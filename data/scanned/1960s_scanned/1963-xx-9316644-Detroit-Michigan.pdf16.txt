Nov-Dec 66

31 Jan 63
Tucuman, Argentina

On January 31, 1963, in a patch of scrub-land near a small town about 5 kilometers from Tucuman, Argentina, several persons witnessed the landing of a mysterious object, with a diameter of about 3.3 meters each, and lying some 40 cms. apart, forming a triangle. This thing, and the patch of ground where it rested, were found to have been scorched, as though by intense heat. At a depth of some 10 cms. below the surface, "as though deposited there," a combination or flame-like objects, "dark red in color," like a figure "8" on its side, was found. A white ash-like powder was found in the center, and the authorities admitted that the only possible explanation was the landing of some kind of unidentified flying object. The witnesses were reluctant to come forward, and it was not until many months later that the story leaked out. Thus far, I quote from the UFO Report, 1963/64, issued by the Study of Unidentified Flying Objects Committee of the Argentina Air Force. But in a letter dated 30th June, 1964, from a correspondent closely connected with the official investigation, I have received a number of further details about the case, and the most interesting of all is that a professional named Flores, who was the chief investigator, said that he and his wife and children had seen an object, silvery-white in color, which appeared to them to be about 25 to 30 meters in diameter, and that it was hovering about 15 meters above the ground, and that the precise area where the marks were subsequently found. This thing was travelling at a very high speed, leaving a trail, and leaving a faint odor behind it. It was only very reluctantly that this witness had consented to tell what he had seen.
