CODE:

I experienced an attack of bright light which startled me at 4:15 a.m. with a tremendous roar. I
was awakened suddenly and rushed outside the house. The object was cigar-shaped, silver in color, and
remained stationary about 1 mile high for approximately 3 minutes. It then shot straight up at a
tremendous speed and disappeared from sight.
