This witness was on his way home when he saw the object. It remained in view for several minutes during which time he made his observations as detailed in his report. The object first appeared as a bright light in the western sky and seemed to be hovering. He estimated its size to be about 20 to 30 feet in diameter. It had a definite shape, similar to a flat disc with a dome on top. The object seemed to oscillate slightly and occasionally gave off a reddish glow. After about 3 or 4 minutes, the object began to move rapidly to the southwest and disappeared from view in about 10 seconds. The witness stated that the object moved across the sky at a very high rate of speed, appeared to be under intelligent control, and he believed it was possibly a spacecraft of some kind.
