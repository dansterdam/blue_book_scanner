SKY OBJECTS REPORTED
IN GLOBE-MIAMI AREA

GLOBE - Three bright, blue objects flying at an estimated 5,000 feet altitude were reported over Arizona Monday night, according to reports received here. 
The objects, which were visible for about 15 minutes, were described as being 20 to 30 feet in diameter, and moving at a fast rate of speed. One resident summed up the appearance of the objects as being similar to "three big electric light bulbs."
The objects were reported to be seen by several residents of the Globe-Miami area, but disappeared over the Tonto Basin. No explanation has been made for the sightings, according to the Arizona Republic.
