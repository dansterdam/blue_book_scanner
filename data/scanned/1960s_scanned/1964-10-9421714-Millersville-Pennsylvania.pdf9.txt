The image does not contain any photograph, but rather a diagram and some text. The diagram appears to be a compass rose with various angles and directions labeled. The text asks the viewer to imagine a sketch and place various markers on the compass rose based on the directions provided in the instructions.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" at the point in the direction on the line to which you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
