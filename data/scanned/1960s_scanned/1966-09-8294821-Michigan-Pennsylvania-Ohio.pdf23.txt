"Estimated size: 43' 13" W, 6' - 44' 40" N at 43 ± .51 km
Trajectory: 265°
Uncorrected azimuth: 265° - 285°
Parabolic orbit: s - 0.317', s = 174.4', e = 5 .200 + .9 - 0.73 A.U.
A search in the Astronomical Numerical Data Service gives several fireball events on the date and similar radiants. These are:
No. 349 1909 Sept. 14
No. 3016 1901 Sept. 14
No. 3039 1909 Sept. 20
No. 3240 1914 Sept. 5
No. 5378 1914 Sept. 8
When we remember that probably a hundred or more fireballs are reported each year, one wonders whose radiants lie near the celestial equator and were it not for this concentrated effort on a few dates, how many more fireballs would have remained unknown. The Observatory at Detroit, Mich., will publish a paper on this fireball based upon very extensive data from previous observations.

A.M.S. No. 2302
This brilliant fireball appeared about 5.34 p.m. E.S.T. It seems to have been observed over portions of Michigan, Ontario, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
It is believed that the sub-point point is quite accurate, the main body being seen over Erie, Pennsylvania. From the elements derived from this data and as figured by F.L. Whipple of the Harvard College Observatory, the velocity was quite low, about 8 km per second, and the height at beginning and end were 61 and 19 km respectively. The reports from airline pilots fortunately were from widely scattered points, and this gave a good basis for triangulation, giving its height, path and other elements with reasonable accuracy. This was a moderately large fireball, probably between that of Moon and Venus in brightness. Do large fireballs have a tendency to break up into smaller fragments, while small ones remain as single units? This fireball seems to have maintained its integrity over a wide range in the calculated heights of beginning and end points. Resulting estimates of the length of path were 59 km, and the average error in duration, it seems needless to calculate this. Since the usual procedure in such cases is to derive the velocity and height and then calculate the mass, size, etc., we might question the advisability of this and wonder if the converse would not be better, i.e., to try to determine the size and then see what the velocity, height, etc. would be. In any case, it is small."
