The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and illustrations. The diagram appears to be an illustration instructing the viewer to draw a picture showing the motion and trajectory of an object or objects in the sky, based on the angles and directions provided. There are also questions related to the number of objects observed and their movement.

The text found in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line that shows the horizon (skyline) where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" where you first saw the object and a "B" on the compass to show the direction you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the point, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were moving, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
