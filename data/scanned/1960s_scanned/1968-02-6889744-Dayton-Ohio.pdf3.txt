OCR TEXT OUTPUT:

This object was definitely not an explainable one. It was seen because I have watched literally hundreds of these at night and they do not stand still in the sky and give off the bright flashing lights that this object did.

It apparently moved very slowly but at no time have I been able to see it the way an airpan might for all have been visible for an arc of a half, and more. It was a quiet watching it.

I used the binocular just to see if I could make out a form on this thing it was not necessary for me to see it.
