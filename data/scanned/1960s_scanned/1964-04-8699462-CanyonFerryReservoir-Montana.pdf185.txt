The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the document discusses a sighting incident that occurred in Montana on April 29, 1964, where residents reported a weird light hovering above the area and the Air Force later deemed it a "hoax".

The text in the document is as follows:

AIR FORCE CABLES MONTANA SIGHTING "HOAX"
Helena, Montana, April 29 - Residents reported a weird light hovering above the east shore of a lake, and immediately took off, soon disappearing in the sky. Several youngsters, who had witnessed the startling occurrence, told officers the object had been about 10 to 12 feet in diameter. They were described as rapidly varying in size and a distinct reddish-orange in color. The object had risen to a height of approximately 25 to 30 feet, and then suddenly took off at a terrific rate of speed, disappearing in the northwest. Air Force officials investigated the incident, and later reported that the sighting was a "hoax".
MEANWHILE, IN Baltimore a missile astronomer who had been quoted in a national magazine as saying the Air Force's report on the Cany on Ferry Lake, Montana landing, described earlier in this issue, was a hoax, said this statement was misinterpreted. He said he considers the Air Force's explanation of the incident "reasonable".
