The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document describing the personnel, facilities, and budgets associated with the project.

VI. Personnel and Facilities
This section provides details about the key personnel involved in the project, including Professor Luis Alvarez as the principal (faculty) investigator, Dr. W. Humphrey as the co-experimenter who will serve as project leader, and Professor S. Silver who will have general administrative responsibility for the project and its relationship to the academic program. A number of graduate students will work with Professor Alvarez for advanced degrees under the program and will be employed as research assistants by the Space Sciences Laboratory.

The major part of the development of the instrumentation and the auxiliary equipment will be done by Professor Alvarez' group in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory where facilities are already available for a project of this magnitude. The Space Sciences Laboratory will provide assistance with balloon techniques and instrumentation of telemetry; the staff members of the Laboratory have considerable experience in conducting balloon-borne experiments.

VII. Budgets
This section describes how the budget is set up in accordance with the division of activities described in Section VI. The Space Sciences Laboratory and the Radiation Laboratory operate under somewhat different rules and procedures, and their overhead rates differ. The budget is therefore divided into two parts, one covering the work to be conducted by the personnel of the Space Sciences Laboratory and the other covering the work to be done by personnel of the Radiation Laboratory. The latter is detailed in quarterly periods in Appendix I which follows the presentation of the composite budget.
