The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The text on the document states instructions for the viewer to "Draw a picture that will show the shape of the phenomenon" and asks "what was the angular size? hold a match at arm's length in front of a crown object, such as a tree or telephone pole. The size of the object covers that match head, the phenomenon would have been covered by the match head." There is also some handwritten text on the page, but no actual photograph provided.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

1s. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS COLORS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.
