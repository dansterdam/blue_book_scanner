34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7 Apr 66
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object was stationary - it hovered - and was a bright red object. It had no wings and seemed bigger than a normal aircraft. It sat there in the sky - where there are never any stars - for some time. After awhile it began to wobble and then took off and disappeared. This was the first sighting of any kind for myself. I have not seen anything like this before and was quite surprised at what was there. I glanced at a clock on and watched it until it swerved out of sight. Then it was gone and has not been seen since.
