There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

The text in the document reads:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  17  /  10  /  66
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. This report was sent to my adminis- trator and I was told that the sighting was not for the Air Force. I agree with my adminis- trator that inasmuch as traditional objects were seen in Canada, I do not feel this would be of interest to the Air Force. The objects ware observed to move both horizontally and erratically, and appeared to stop and remain motionless for short periods of time, before continuing on. We feel this is not for the fact that traditional objects were seen, and we appreciate your consideration in this matter.
