DONNYBROOK, NORTH DAKOTA
AUGUST 6, 1966

The night investigator called and reported that he had witnessed a U.F.O. in the Donnybrook, North Dakota area the previous evening, August 5, 1966. He described it as a large, bright light that was seen hovering over a field west of Donnybrook for approximately 15-20 minutes. He said that he was unable to get closer to it as it was quite a distance away. 

Arrangements were made for a follow-up investigation on August 6, 1966. I went to the site, accompanied by the night investigator, and we spent several hours carefully searching the area but found no evidence of any kind to substantiate the sighting. The field where the U.F.O. was reported to have been seen was thoroughly examined and photographed. No unusual markings or disturbances of any kind were found. The photographs taken show only the normal, snow-covered terrain of the area.

In the absence of any physical evidence to support the sighting, and the inability to locate any corroborating witnesses, I can only conclude that the original report was the result of a misidentification of some relatively common natural phenomenon.
