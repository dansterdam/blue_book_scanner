Dear Dr. Hynek,
Let me start off by thanking you and my wife Vallie for the dinner on Thursday, November 25. It is really a pleasure to finally be able to discuss this thing personally with someone who is interested and open-minded on the subject instead of just looking at it from the humorous side. To we were definitely exciting, scary and weird -- but humorous -- and I could have laughed at that time if my life had depended on it. The reason we didn't call you right away from Tuesday evening was that we all feel that if people want to learn about these things just let them read one of the books written by Donald Keyhoe. I explained to Vallie that I really feel we will find my uncle in time to be rather intriguing. I will tell you everything I can remember more details. My husband, Mr. was also present and went out in the car to try to get a closer view of the object. Now made a file of the newspaper clippings and pictures printed through him which arrived that day. We had been in Tacoma City that evening and the weather was "rain" with a heavy overcast. The weather was bad in general for much of that night. We had just finished dinner and had some coffee before we went outside and could not determine certainly that anything had flashed in the sky, but did hear a peculiar sound that we both noted. This is all I can give you at the present time but will be in touch with you again soon. Sincerely yours...
