The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch is a compass rose with directional labels. The second sketch depicts a person standing on a road with a wide landscape view in the background.

6A. NO VCU IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "Y" WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. INDICATE SPEED AND DURATION OF THE PHENOMENON IF POSSIBLE.
