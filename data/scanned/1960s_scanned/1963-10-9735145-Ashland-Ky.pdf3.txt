The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed memorandum from the Department of the Air Force Office of the Secretary, dated October 21, 1963. The memorandum is addressed to Sgt. Moody and appears to be related to a previous letter sent to the President, regarding some individuals who were listed. The memorandum also mentions that in the 16th, they are listed as "].lated as".

Now, as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:
