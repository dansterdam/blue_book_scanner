REFUELING MISSIONS
Differ from other missions in that lights on the tanker and multiple A/C engaged in the operation add visual characteristics not normally associated with aircraft flight. Reports are flight time only since daylight operations can be recognized by the observer. May be both low and high altitude refueling missions involve multiple lights moving around, in formation. Flight of the basic tanker formation will be straight and steady. Lights in an area may run as high as 15 minutes but each observed a single pass and require not much more than 1-2 minutes. Lights may appear going one way then appear on their return path at a later time. Operations are controlled and scheduled is conducted in specific areas. The location of these areas and the agency to contact for use are specific cases. Tankers engaged in this operation will provide information as to the exact nature of the missions, how long they will last, and new schedules maintained.
a) A/C using flare drops--More often reported as flares rather than A/C engaged in photo work.
b) A/C using strobes for illuminating the target. Can be low level or high altitude missions. Only the strobe light is visible and the A/C is reported as a source of slowly spaced flashes.
c) Infra Red--These aircraft are specially equipped with turbine generators to drive the equipment. The generator makes a noise similar to a whine and can be heard above the noise of the aircraft. Many are on classified projects and the agencies doing this work are limited. The A/C utilized are relatively slow, sound will be associated with the object and the landing lights are used because of the low altitudes flown. The A/C will be low, sound will be associated with the object and the landing lights should be observed. No portion of the infra red equipment will be observed.
