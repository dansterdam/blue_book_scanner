The image contains a diagram and some text, but no photograph. The diagram shows a curved line with angle markings and a compass rose, which appears to be related to instructions for estimating the motion and direction of an observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was observed (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how low the object was observed (skyline) when you last saw it. Place on "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. On a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made, place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
