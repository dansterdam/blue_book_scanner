SAUCER LANDING IN VIRGINIA: A seven-page report from a "concerned citizen" was received by the Air Force on 18 January 1965 concerning a saucer landing incident which allegedly occurred in the vicinity of Ft. Knox, Kentucky on 14 March 1963.

The report states that several witnesses observed a silvery disc-shaped object, approximately 50 feet in diameter, slowly descend and land in a wooded area near the fort. After landing, several humanoid figures were seen to emerge from the craft and move around it briefly before re-entering and departing the area at a high rate of speed. The witnesses, who included military personnel, were reportedly quite shaken by the incident. 

The report further states that an extensive search of the landing site was conducted by military authorities, and some ground markings were allegedly found. However, no other physical evidence or debris was recovered. The report concludes by stating that the witnesses are still living in the area and would be willing to provide further information if contacted.
