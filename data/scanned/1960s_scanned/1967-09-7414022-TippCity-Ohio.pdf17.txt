The object was first observed at approximately 2130 hours and was described as being about 2 to 3 feet in diameter, pulsating with a yellow-orange color, and moving in a westerly direction at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for about 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing from view.

5. No further action is required at this time.
