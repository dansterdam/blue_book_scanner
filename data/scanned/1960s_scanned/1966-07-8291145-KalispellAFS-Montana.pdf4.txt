The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that includes a diagram and questions related to the sighting of an unidentified object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are the person shown. Draw the object as you saw it. Show the place where you first saw it, the path it took in the sky (dotted line), and the place where you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place an "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the starting point, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
