3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2 1/2 Minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: NE
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: (BALLOON, WEATHER)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted a bright light similar to a star or white recognition light on an aircraft that traveled in an erratic flight path. It passed through some thin layers of clouds, grew dim and finally disappeared.
COMMENTS: A weather balloon was launched from a nearby weather station at 0018 hrs. The observer did not think he saw the balloon because surface winds were blowing toward the SW and the object he saw traveled toward the NNE. However at 6,000 ft the wind was blowing ENE and at 10,000 ft was blowing NNE. This type of balloon can be seen to about 10,000 ft and ascends at about 1,000 ft minutes.
