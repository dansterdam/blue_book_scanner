The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left shows a curved line in the sky with an object above the horizon, indicating the observer's perception of how high the object was in the sky. The smaller sketch on the right shows a person standing on a road with some buildings and a hilly landscape in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Places an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" on the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position where you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
