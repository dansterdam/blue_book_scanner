This image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be an excerpt from a document or report related to Project Blue Book. The image includes two circular maps depicting the South Polar Area. The maps seem to be providing geographic information, likely related to UFO sightings or investigations. There is also a text section on the right side of the image, which I will attempt to transcribe below.
