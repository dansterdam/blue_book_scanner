What was seepo[?] on ground:
Saw about 10 o'clock in the evening, a light appear in the sky. It was circular in shape and appeared very large. It seemed to be hovering in the sky and then suddenly it began to descend. It came down very quickly and disappeared behind some trees. When it came down it cast a light over the ground. We were very excited and went outside to look for it, but couldn't find anything. About 10 minutes later, we saw the same light come up over the trees and then it disappeared into the sky.
