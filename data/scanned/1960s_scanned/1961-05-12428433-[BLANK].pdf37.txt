The image contains a photograph depicting a "LOADING SYSTEM" for an inflatable structure in space. The photograph shows two diagrams of the loading system components.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
LOADING SYSTEM
FIGURE 5
As mentioned earlier, we were actually able to make an airfoil shaped, lifting body structure intended for use in interplanetary flight with a speed-flied number of yards of a 6-foot 015 wing structure. We could use this loading system and further useful in this way, we actually worked with the Navy. As we tried to make it as small as possible. If a pilot is down in some hostile territory, you could fly over, drop this loading device, he could then turn a valve and he would inflate, start the engine and fly back to his base. We made an airplane like this, we had to make what you would call breakthroughs in the state of the art of inflatable structures. We were able to make a conventional structure. We have a short movie now of one of these little airplanes so you can get some idea of it's design and flight characteristics.  We wanted this technique for the Army. (Movie shown of inflatable plane being unpacked and flown)  Dr. Boesen: The next slides cover some of our space stations. Since this field covers everything from underwater to in the air and off the planet, and the space field is what we are in, this is what we are talking about. Those inflatable structures such as some that require large strengths-light weight, such as a space station, those that more or less surround high temperatures such as solar collectors and so on.
