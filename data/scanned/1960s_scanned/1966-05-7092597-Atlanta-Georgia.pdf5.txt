The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old report document, likely from Project Blue Book, that contains handwritten responses to various questions about a UFO sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The handwritten response indicates that the object appeared to dim or fade away slowly.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
The handwritten response indicates that the object did not move behind anything, and the observer is uncertain if it moved behind a cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The handwritten response indicates that the object did not move in front of anything, and the observer is uncertain if it moved in front of a cloud.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: "None"
b. Color: "White, with little green & red"

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
The handwritten response provides details about the approximate size of the object compared to a match stick or arm's length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, appendages, etc., and specify whether they were solid, outlined, or vapor trails. Please an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The image contains a handwritten sketch and notes describing the shape and movement of the observed object.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know
If you answered YES, then tell what:
The object did not move behind anything, and I'm uncertain if it moved behind a cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know

a. Sound: None
b. Color: White, with little green & red

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
A match stick covered about 10 percent of the object at arm's length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, appendages, etc., and specify whether they were solid, outlined, or vapor trails.
