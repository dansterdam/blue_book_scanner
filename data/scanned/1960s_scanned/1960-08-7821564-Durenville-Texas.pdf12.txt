September 30, 1960

Mr. Antonio J. Texas
San Antonio 1, Texas

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

We thank you once again for another fine observation report.

The nature, of course, is virtually impossible to determine the existence of this object. Your description seems to concur with other sightings made in your area to:

Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center
United States Air Force
(ATIN REX)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

so that your report may be compared with any others which may have been received elsewhere.

If you should experience further sightings of this object, please report directly to the above address.

Thank you for your time and interest.

Respectfully,

Warren V. McCurdy
