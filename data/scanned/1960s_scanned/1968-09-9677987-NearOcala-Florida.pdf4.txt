There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from what seems to be a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing typed text discussing details of an incident.

Now, you came on the line and said, "We had a height finder on you and were tracking you and there was an object behind you for quite awhile northwest of Palm Beach." This then would have been about half and hour or so after the Ocala incident.

** Yes sir. It was definitely later than Ocala.

R And then you say, "We had numerous height finder checks on you; also an object less than 1 mile behind you." Mr. ___ then says, --oh yes. here's a part I missed earlier--Mr. ___ said, "We turned and saw what appeared to be the same white light as we saw over Ocala, in a steep turn."

** OK. That's when we asked him to make that 360Â° turn over Palm Beach.

R I see. And then he says, "When we saw it, it looked like it descended rather rapidly. I would definitely not try to identify it." Then you asked him about the thought, it didn't look like a jet aircraft can't make the sharp turns these things were making." And then you asked, "Everytime you saw it, it was making steep turns?" And he said, "No, it would hover and then it would proceed on course exactly the same way we were going, ahead of us then it would go straight up, over the top, or straight down."

Did he add anything? Let's see, this -- was this a telephone conversation?

** Yes sir. I called him long distance and talked to him immediately after.
