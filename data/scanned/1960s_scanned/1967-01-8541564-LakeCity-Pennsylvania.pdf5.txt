There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document with text describing a UFO sighting.

Gentlemen:

I am sorry that the investigation which you requested on March 8, 1967 at Lake City, Pennsylvania requires the preparation of this report. It is my duty here to determine the way in which this photograph which was taken and forwarded to you at approximately 7:00 p.m. on March 8, 1967 can be explained. Some local citizens who are well respected in this community have stated that what they observed in the sky was a small cloud or haze which suddenly appeared and as suddenly disappeared. Two of the persons present at the time stated that they could see a small light object which was hovering about the cloud. They further stated that this object moved in a random manner and then left the scene at a high rate of speed. Their description of the object and the way in which it moved in the sky tends to indicate that what they observed was not of a normal nature. The object, according to the persons who saw it, appeared to be approximately 15 to 20 feet in length and 2 to 3 feet in width. The object gave off no light but appeared solid in structure from their observation. I am at a loss to determine exactly what this object was or to offer any definite explanation for its appearance and disappearance. The individuals concerned are considered to be honest and reliable and I see no reason why they would attempt to fabricate or exaggerate this incident. I would appreciate any assistance or advice you could provide regarding this matter.
