The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image does not contain any photograph, only text. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document.

THE FIREBALL OF SEPTEMBER 3:
1964, by Budd a. child, CUFOS Co-Chairman: 
The bright fireball seen over a wide area of California at about 9:30 P.M. on September 3, 1964, was, in all probability, the most spectacular astronomical event of the year. Seen from as far north as San Francisco to as far south as San Diego, and from the Pacific Ocean to beyond the borders of the State of California, this fireball was brighter than the full Moon and could be seen for over fifty miles. 
There has never been anything quite like it in the State of California. This was our best opportunity, we thought.
