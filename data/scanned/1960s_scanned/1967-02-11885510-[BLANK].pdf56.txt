There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old document discussing the history of the idea that intelligent beings might exist outside of Earth, and the development of this idea over time.

SECTION I
HISTORY OF THE PROBLEM

The idea that intelligent beings might exist outside of the earth was debated in antiquity (Anaxagoras, Plutarch, Lucian, etc.). This speculation was frowned upon by the Catholic Church as contradictory to the Christian dogma of the uniqueness of man and his relation to the universe. During the Renaissance the idea of habitable worlds was again revived (Nicolaus Cusanus, Giordano Bruno, Kepler, etc.).

The telescope showed many details on the surface of the planets which generally favored the idea of habitability. It was assumed that man was the goal to which all creation moves and consequently, the celestial bodies did not have any reason to exist unless they served as homes for intelligent beings. In the 18th Century, such scientists as Huygens, Fontenelle, Swedenborg, and others wrote elaborate treatises on the supposed inhabitants of other planets, and even the great philosopher Kant thought that at least some of the planets besides the earth might be inhabited.

Further development of this idea occurred in the early 19th Century. Sir William Herschel, perhaps the greatest observational astronomer of all times, deduced from his own observations that the sun was really a dark body which very well might be inhabited.
