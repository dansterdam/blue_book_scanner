MAJOR FRIEND, AFDLIN-4h

1. Mr. J. W., the undersigned at 1520 hours by report a UFO. The information given is as follows:

Mr. J. W., a resident of Hazel Green, Wisconsin. The sighting occurred on 4 April 1960 at approximately 1515 hours. He was engaged in routine farming activities when he was attracted by a bright, silver-colored object in the sky. The object was moving slowly in an east to west direction. The object was about three times the size of a jet aircraft as seen from the ground. The object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes. There were no trails, vapor or exhaust noted. The object then appeared to increase in speed and altitude and disappeared from sight. Mr. J. W. feels that all the information that Mr. [REDACTED] has about the sighting is true.

2. Mr. [REDACTED] had attempted to contact you today but apparently was unable to reach you. His intent was to tell you that a close inspection of the object of 4 April 1960 from the same area and at the same time of 1929 hours. The object was still visible and was the same size as previously reported.

3. Mr. [REDACTED] is desirous of talking with you and will probably try to contact you on Monday, 18 April 1960. He had your office extension.
