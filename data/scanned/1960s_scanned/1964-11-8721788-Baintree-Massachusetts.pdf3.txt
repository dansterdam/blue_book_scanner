NOV. 7 1964

Gentlemen:
Before we start we want to tell you that we respect our countries' Air Force and what it is doing for the defense of our country and the free world.
The organization called NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) has proved to the public that the U.S. Air Force has been withholding information concerning UFO's.
We here in Braintree have sighted the Flying Saucer Investigation Agency for the purpose of discovering hidden information (hidden by USAF) concerning UFO's and exposing it to the public.
We ourselves have seen a flying saucer and the creatures that control it. We know what the saucer may have been a meteorite except for its fantastic speed. 
This "craft" traveled faster than any jet plane that ever passed the sky. Upon your request we will send a detailed report.
We hereby pledge to "work" to our greatest extent to eliminate any and all secrecy regarding UFO's.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
