The image appears to contain a detailed sketch or diagram, but no actual photograph. The sketch shows a horizon line with a curved line and several markings to indicate the position and motion of a UFO object. There is also a compass-like element in the top right corner. Below the sketch, there are several questions or instructions asking the viewer to draw additional diagrams or make observations about the object's movement and trajectory.

The text in the document says:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. 

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were travelling.
