The image contains a hand-drawn diagram or sketch, but no photographic image.

PERSONAL CONCLUSIONS:
First U.P.O. seen by either observer. Highly unlikely object sighted; was estimated through some years in the same size as an advertizing plane - not resembling anything celestial body (star, moon, etc.)

I know we should have reported it to the nearest Air Force Base, but was busy and unable to report before.

Illustration:
The illustration shows a diagram with a circular object labeled "Observation" and a linear object labeled "S" and "E", potentially representing the observed UFO and its flight path.
