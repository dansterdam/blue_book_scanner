Dear sir,

On the 22d part of August last year. I saw about 8:30 p.m. two objects in the sky which I could not identify. They appeared round and metallic in color and moved across the sky in a north to south direction. The first object crossed the sky in approximately 30 seconds and the second object followed approximately 1 minute later. They moved at a steady rate of speed and did not appear to be aircraft. I did not hear any sound from the objects.

I hope this information is of some use to you.
