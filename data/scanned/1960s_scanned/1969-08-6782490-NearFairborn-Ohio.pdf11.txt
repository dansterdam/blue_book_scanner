I'm afraid that they did appear to be landing right in front of us.
The object appeared to be dark in color and hovering.
It was moving in a straight line from right to left.
As I mentioned, the object appeared to be landing. 
It appeared to be covered by the match head.
Not impossible that it could be covered by the match.
