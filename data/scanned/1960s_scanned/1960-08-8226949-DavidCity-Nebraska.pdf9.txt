The report mentions details about the object's appearance, trajectory, and observed characteristics.

Transcribed text from the document:

"...had a Brilliant lighting sighting that lasted about 15 minutes, and stated that the object was then about 3 feet in diameter and had a fiery appearance. He said the object diminished in size until it was only about a foot in diameter and then suddenly went out of sight.

This object was also detected by a tracking station, and apparently was viewed visually by a Clayton Stinson, who reported it to the Air Force.

This incident occurred the evening of Oct 8, 1960, near David City, Nebraska, and the CDE number is 60-8226949."
