The image contains a typed document that appears to be part of a UFO report from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this particular page.

The text of the document is as follows:

"The apparent approach of the light being attributed to a maneuver of some sort.
The approach of the light stopping when the car was discovered stationary and the lights continuing just prior to its disappearance.

We can find no evidence to think that this was not the case. During our brief visit to Lansing we interviewed more than twenty witnesses in connection with this sighting. They all confirmed the details of the incident as reported by the occupants of the car. In our opinion there is no reason to doubt the basic accuracy of the information given. 

When a sighting of this nature is reported, there are sometimes conditions surrounding the observation which might shed additional light on what has been seen. In this case, all of the witnesses confirmed the basic observation - that a bright light was seen approaching and then stopping, at which time the light went out. Beyond this, the witnesses could add little to explain the nature of the object which they had sighted. This is particularly true when, as often happens, the light is observed for only a brief period of time and then disappears.

When we find the only visible sign of a sighting is a light in the sky, we are usually left with the impression that this was a very puzzling and perplexing observation. I wish that I could confirm to you more conclusive evidence in the way of physical clues to the nature of this sighting, but the testimony which reached us during our investigation of your report supports only those details which you have provided.

Sincerely,

DAVID J. MOODY
Capt, USAF
