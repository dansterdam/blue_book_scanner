PID (TDEW)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433
14 September 1965

Dear 
The description of the objects which you observed on the night of 25 July 1965 was submitted to meteorologists. The duration of twenty minutes is not consistent with our evaluation. The duration indicated would show no details. The direction of the objects' speed and altitude precluded detailed indicators a possible satellite observation, but the description of the object is not in accord with this evaluation. The most significant disparity is in view of the conflicting data presented, the impossibility of a precise identification of the objects. However, a duration of 20 minutes is too long for an aircraft to be observed. The time has been estimated the conflicting data, in view of the description, duration, speed and elevation or altitude of the objects.

The attached brochure gives the results of our Project Blue Book, an unclassified project.

The Air Force does not engage in any activities such as you have indicated in your letter of 25 September 1955. Nor do we request the FBI or local officials to do so.

The Air Force regards all witnesses as reliable and sincere and does not question the integrity of those reporting sightings. Your report was forwarded to us from Los Angeles and the additional form was which you because no evaluation could be made on the original. I have reviewed the information you provided and your report has received the evaluation given in our previous correspondence. No further investigation into this matter will be made.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr.
Captain, USAF
