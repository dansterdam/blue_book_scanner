The object observed appeared as a fuzzy, translucent, globular shape with no apparent outline or edges. Its brightness varied from time to time, with occasional pulsing or flashing. There was no trail or exhaust, and no sound was associated with it. The object remained visible for about 10-15 minutes before fading from view. Its illumination appeared neither bright nor dark, but rather a subdued, hazy glow.
