The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs, but rather includes a diagram and instructions related to sighting UFOs.

The text found in the document is as follows:

27. On the following sketch, imagine that the object you saw is shown on "A". Place an "A" on the sky-line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the sky-line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
