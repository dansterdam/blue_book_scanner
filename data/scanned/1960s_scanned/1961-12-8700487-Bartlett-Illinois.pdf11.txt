Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

Your recent letter concerning an unidentified flying object has been received. 

From the information furnished, it is not possible to state what the object was. I have enclosed three copies of our standard questionnaire. Request you complete one of these and advise other witnesses complete the remaining copies.

It is desired to determine to the extent possible just what your local police were able to learn as a result of your call. You might also determine if the fire department made any observation.

Your interest in reporting this sighting is appreciated. Please forward the completed questionnaires in the enclosed pre-addressed envelopes. No postage is required.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
