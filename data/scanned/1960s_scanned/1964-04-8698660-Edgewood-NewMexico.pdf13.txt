"Flare-up of both eyes and first-degree burns under the eyes and on the nose. 
Police interviewed the girl a [2d] month and had her draw the silvery object which she had seen in the sky. Several other children saw it too, at the same time, but did not mention it so long. 
The above incident caused an unprecedented warning to Albuquerque residents from their police chief, A. B. Martinez. The chief asked that all youngsters, - and everyone, for that matter, - stay away from mysterious objects. He gave no hint as to what he thinks UFOs really are, but stated that if they are sighted by Albuquerque residents, they should be treated with respect and caution until more information as to their identity is available."
