I was working down on the Congo at the time when suddenly we noticed something strange in the sky. It looked like a small aircraft at first but it appeared to be moving extremely fast and stopped abruptly right over our heads. The light disappeared. A rather noisy pegger-driven plane came into our visibility a few minutes later, but I did not observe any connection between the plane and the light I had seen. The light disappeared. I had not observed any sound or smoke associated with the light. The light appeared to be quite small, about the size of a grapefruit. After the plane came into view, the light did not reappear. I did not attempt to contact any authorities or report this incident, as I did not attach any great significance to it at the time and was anxious to continue with my work. I was alone at the time and there were no other witnesses.
