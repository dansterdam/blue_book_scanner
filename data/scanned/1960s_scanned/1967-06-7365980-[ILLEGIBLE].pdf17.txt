Dear Sir, of the Air Force

Dear Sir:
On the night of June 3, 1967 at approximately 11:30 p.m., an unidentified flying object was seen by several people in Manville, N.J.

The object was a triangular-shaped craft with a bright light on each corner and red blinking lights around its center, and red blinking lights on the outside. It was a silent craft, and was observed for about 10 minutes.

At first it appeared as a very bright light, like a star, but as it came closer it took on a triangular shape. It then hovered for a while and moved away at a fast speed. When it moved away it appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length.

The object was seen by several people in the area, and was also seen by a local policeman. I am one of the witnesses, and I would be glad to give you any further details if you so desire.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
Manville, N.J.
Dec 11, 1967
