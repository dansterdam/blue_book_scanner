This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

To date there has been no evidence submitted
to our office by the Air Force indicating
significant scientific developments beyond the
range of our present day knowledge in the
principles known to this office. The vague way in
which officials describe these sightings indicates
that many of these unidentified aerial objects
were extraterrestrial vehicles under intelligent
control.

Sincerely,
