The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a handwritten document with text describing an observation.

The text in the document states:

The car stopped and the lights went out. James noticed the lights had almost gone out so he got out of the car. He said all of a sudden the car settled and the engine and lights went off. Then nobody seemed to get out of the car. Truthfully, I was the scared to carefully observe the object. I just noticed the two lights when they finally got the car going.
