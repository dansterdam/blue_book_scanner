APR 28-17(C1)
WE were driving home on the evening of Jan.9,1968, 2 noticed two bright lights in the sky. The lights were about a mile apart and were very still at the time. After about 3 minutes later, I had arrived home. I went to the side of my home and saw the lights were still there. I hurried inside, grabbed my 7X35 binoculars and went to my back yard where I could see them. My first observation was a slight halo and a reddish color around the outer edges. I have a good video camera to the Minox & Bolus 16mm movie camera, but it was not suitable for distant photography. We all witnessed a slow, gradual change of position. I observed and watched to note the time. Watching through binoculars did not yield any additional information. After watching for 10 minutes (the lapse of time), we observed the lights and disappeared. A minute later they reappeared. The total time required to disappear was estimated at about 15 seconds. This object like that of a lightning flash out of about 9 second interval. We confirmed this brightness to that of the brightest star. The temperature was noted to be +9Â°F with no moon and no wind. There were no clouds and no sound was heard. After the sighting, I wrote down all the facts in some detail as soon as I could.
