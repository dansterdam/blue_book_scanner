Dear Sirs:
This morning our local paper carried a request for a sighting of a "UFO" on March 3. 
On that date at 10:10 PM my husband and I saw a large falling firebell in the southern sky at approximately 45Â° from the horizon. It was a large fireball with a long tail and it wavered in its path as if the object could be rolling. 
I saw it as it started to burn and called my husband across the room. It lasted about forty five seconds and burned out as we watched. There was no sound.
I have been watching for a request in the papers because I did not know where to send such information.
