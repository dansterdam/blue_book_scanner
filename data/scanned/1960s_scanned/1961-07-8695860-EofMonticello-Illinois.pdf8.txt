Dear sirs:

This is the information given to me.
On July 18, 1961 at about 10:30 P.M. in Monticello, Illinois, (Piatt County), my wife and I observed three bright lights in the sky traveling from east to west at a high rate of speed. The lights were about thirty to forty feet in diameter and were evenly spaced. They seemed to be rotating in a circular motion. They disappeared from our sight as they went over the horizon.
