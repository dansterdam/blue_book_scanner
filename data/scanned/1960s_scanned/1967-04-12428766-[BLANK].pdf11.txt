OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Dear Mr. Noyes:

We appreciate your invitation of March 6 to participate in a UFO panel discussion as the annual AAUN meeting. Unfortunately, at this particular time, an Air Force representative take part in such a panel before such a distinguished audience could be of great benefit to us, and we shall be happy to work with you toward this end.

Major Quintanilla, whose job is administering the UFO reports made to the Air Force, and he has limited dealings with the press. Our practices here should be brrunt of dealings with the press and public on this subject, and you might wish to consider having one of our people on the panel in addition to Major Quintanilla.

We look forward to working with your people on this panel and ask that you contact Lt Colonel Jacks of our Public Information Division to work out further details. He, or Capt Enesis in his absence, can be reached on 695-5809 or 695-7793.

Sincerely,

E. B. LEBATILY
