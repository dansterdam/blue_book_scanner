The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page of text from what appears to be a report on sightings of reflected lights in the sky over Cocoa, Florida. The text describes the incident, including that police officers observed the lights and recorded the event, but that no photographs or recordings were made at the time.

Lights
Mirrored
By Sky?

PATRICK AFB - (UPI) - The mysterious colored
lights observed by four policemen over the city of Cocoa
apparently were reflections from the ground, the Air
Force said Friday.

A spokesman for Patrick AFB said an investigation 
showed that a similar condition of temperature inversion
over the city caused the lights to appear mirrored in the
sky. He said a cold air mass below a warm layer of air 
caused the phenomenon to be observed around the city.

"The spottlights and other lights in the area, would have 
been seen mirrored in the sky for up to 15 minutes," said the
spokesman. "The Air Force has completed its investigation
and determined that the formation actually was a mirage."
The spokesman said no unusual objects or aircraft were
in the sky at the time.
