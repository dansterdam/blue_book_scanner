PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT 
DATE OF REPORT: 30 August 1964
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 
LOCATION: COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO
DATE: 30 August 1964
PHOTOGRAPHY: - 3 EXPOSURES PROVIDED BY USAF
PURPOSE: This report analyzes work under number 64-103 submitted by Major R. Quintanilla, Project Blue Book, relating to the reported sighting of an unidentified flying object.
ANALYSIS: According to the Technical Division photo analysis and photo processing personnel, they were unable to define any objects or damage which could be attributed to the film. The film was examined and analyzed by experts, and the findings indicate that the film shows only normal sky conditions. There appears to be no evidence that the film contained any unusual or unidentified objects.
CONCLUSIONS: The film examined shows only normal sky conditions and family photographing. After the family photographed, they reported seeing an unidentified object. These items appear to be near the point where the photography was taken. However, the photographic evidence does not substantiate the existence of any unidentified flying object in the film. Therefore, the image causing the object is probably attributable to other known causes.
