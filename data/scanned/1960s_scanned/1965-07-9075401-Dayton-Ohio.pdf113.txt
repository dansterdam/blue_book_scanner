At Tegucigalpa, Honduras, wire press reports said that a peasant in the village of El Carral had seen a disc-shaped object in the sky which gave off colored lights and moved at high speed just above the treetops. Field workers at the Guatemala and El Salvador border, reported seeing a flying object of the same description hovering in the sky for several minutes, then took off at high speed.
