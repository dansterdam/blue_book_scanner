The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document. It contains a photograph of a man, presumably the subject of the report. The text in the image discusses the "Effects of Nuclear Weapons" and mentions President Kennedy's speech on the topic.

As an OCR system, I will now extract all the text from the document:

EDITORIAL

Effects Of Nuclear Weapons
One of the serious consequences of the U.S. atmospheric nuclear tests, as President Kennedy said last March, was to add to the burden of our military command capabilities. Our Air Force Command must operate effectively in a nuclear environment as our weapon systems must be capable of performing their mission, even when subjected to the residual effects of nuclear tests.
A clear understanding of nuclear effects is necessary to solutions of problems created as a result of the capability: hardening of our missile and aircraft, and to hardening of our country vehicles against enemy attack on our nation.
Certain steps are, of course, necessary to redress the Air Force Special Weapons Command problems. Recent investigations have found these steps are needed to overcome damages found where possible to find ways other than the actual testing, to pro vide the needed information.
The data accumulated in progress in finding new measures of effects data during the moratorium years. A great many theoretical investigations were conducted with the end in view of developing effects data as a low cost means of studying certain effects.
Many individuals of experiments, which were considered as small scale effects tests, have been conducted at the Center. The experiments, all have been minor, and have often used a combination of methods which appear to cover the requirements sufficiently, reducing the months to some as we begin operations in our new nuclear arena as impact through military and civil community to be less.
As we conclude certain phases of activity as President Kennedy said, "We are spending more money on military tools in the last year than we have in recent years, because our communicanons which enable our command and control centers to disintence a response; and because we must have the means of delivering these tools with electronic guidance systems to find their targets, and providing them with electronic guidance systems to find their targets, and providing them with electronic guidance systems to find their targets.
What we cannot be certain, how much of this turn out to be useless, blocked out, paralyzed or destroyed by the complex effects of nuclear explosions."
This year, Special Weapons Center's theoretical work and labor tories will help provide the certainty to qualify and support the Air Force programs required to harden our weapon systems and operate in the environment of a nuclear detonation, as Commander, AFSWC.
