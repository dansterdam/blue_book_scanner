The image provided does not contain any visible photograph or image. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads:

WASHINGTON, MAY XX (UP) - HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER CLARENCE GREENE SHOW FLYING SAUCERS CLIPPED
CLIENT WAS UNABLE TO PERSUADE THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TO SEND REPRESENTATIVE TO FILM THEM. CLAIMS PICTURES WOULD DISCREDIT FLYING SAUCER INVESTIGATIONS THAT FLYING SAUCERS DO NOT EXIST, THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS MADE IN ALL CASES.
RUSSELL P. (CG-CA(?) ABOUT A REPORT THAT HE SIGHTED UNKNOWN OBJECTS IN SKY WHICH TURNED OUT ACTUALLY TO BE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS ON A TABLE. HE CLAIMS THEY APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR. AIR FORCE STATEMENTS ACTUALLY SUPPORT CLAIM THAT THERE MUST BE SOME TRUTH IN WHAT GREENE SAYS THEY PHOTOGRAPH.
GREENE ADMITTED HE WAS NOT PERMITTED TO SELL IT - BUT, HE SAID, HE ALSO WANTS TO PROVE THAT THE FILMS REPRESENTING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, HE SAID HE HAD MADE.

The line "Grandy identifies...???" appears to be a handwritten note or query at the bottom of the text.
