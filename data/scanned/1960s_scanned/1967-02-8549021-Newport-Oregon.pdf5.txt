The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text in the document is as follows:

My photo in plain view does not indicate the entire phenomenon. The object seemed to get on the ground. Her description of the total flight differs somewhat from mine. Most of what she describes I did see but am not certain of some points. I do not believe the usual explanation of a steady light observed.
2. Color of light, similar to polariz.
3. Very sharp, tight, about 1/4 of the size of a full moon.
4. Following the path of the object with the binoculars I lost it momentarily but reloced it near the same point after a very short interval. My observation confirmed hers for the most part.
That is all I can add now. If you have any other questions please call me collect.
