SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 25 May 64, Ansted, W Va.

1. This office has received an unidentified flying object report from Ansted, West Virginia. This letter is forwarded to your office for such action as you may make a reply.

2. The information as the information indicates by this report indicates that the object observed was a meteor. The duration of 1 - 2 seconds and the description of the object with a flashing tail and a vertical fall through 25 degrees are consistent with this analysis. In his initial description, the witness has been included and there was a possibility that magnesium flares used in night photo missions indicate that the object was not a meteor. This could not have been the case. The report remains consistent with those of satellite decays. However, this does not with those of satellite decays. It should be noted that the duration of a decay is much longer (up to 1 minute) the colors tend to be reds and yellows, and speeds are much slower and disintegration or breaking up is quite common.
