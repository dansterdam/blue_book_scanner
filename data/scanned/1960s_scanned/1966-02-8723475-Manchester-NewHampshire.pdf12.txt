The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document dated November 16, 1967, regarding a reported unidentified flying object (UFO) observation.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
UFO (UFO ) 16 NOV 67
UFO OBSERVATION & PHOTOGRAPHS: 25 FEBRUARY 1965
Manchester, New Hampshire 03103

1. Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs - In the original questionnaire you completed, you stated the objects were clearly defined, and the objects were described in your observation as being "over 100 feet wide, going northwest in question #27, and later changed direction to 600 feet."

2. The other witness states that it was a cloudy night, the objects were like bluish-white lights, and on question #27 indicates that he saw the objects going northwest.

3. Both you and the other witness state that there were two objects. The photographs show there was only one "white ball" on the print. There is little or no evidence of a hard image within the emulsion showing the actual size and shape of the object.

Most apparent images on the film are the result of careless processing or scanning, with the additional information provided, the object was calculated to have been fourteen feet across the minor axis.

There is, however, no definite outline or shape for the "object" due to insufficient clarity to enable a positive identification.
