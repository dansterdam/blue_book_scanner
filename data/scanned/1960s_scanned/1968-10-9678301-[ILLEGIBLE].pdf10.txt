The image appears to contain a hand-drawn diagram rather than a photograph. The diagram shows an oval-shaped object labeled "Darker center" within a larger oval. There is some text surrounding the diagram that provides additional context and description.

As an OCR system, I will now extract all the text visible in the document:

AFR 80-17(C)

"WHAT WAS THE CIRCULAR THING? WOULD A MATCH ALWAYS LIGHT UP WHAT APPEARED TO BE A BODY OF SOOT SHOWN CENTER THAT WOULD NOT LIGHT UP WHAT WAS ON THE OUTSIDE. IT WOULD HAVE APPEARED THAT SOME GREAT WEIGHT OR FORCE LIFTED UP AWAY FROM THE BODY OF THE OBJECT SHOWING AT ONCE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE MATERIALS. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE EXACTLY HOW LARGE THE OBJECT WAS WHICH WAS ON THE GROUND FROM ANY DISTANCE BUT IT WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO BE 12-15 FEET IN DIAMETER."
