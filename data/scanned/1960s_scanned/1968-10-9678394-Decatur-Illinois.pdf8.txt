Catco object was really too slight giving off gobs of light on the side like lighting would glare on water the slightest wind seemed to make it dance around and it was very quiet outside, the power plant a mile away makes a hum normally the southwest seemed to be the direction it came from anything like it and it went on for 10 or 15 minutes a perfect night through most of a thing i would have watched longer but it was getting cold and my wife would have been worried also since it was now 8:05 p.m. and my mom would have wanted me home.
