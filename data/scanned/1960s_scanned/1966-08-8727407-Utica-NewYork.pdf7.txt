7. Identifying information on observer:
a. Civilian: Name 18, Mailing Address Ave., Utica, NY, Occupation Mel's Dairy Isle, Estimate of Reliability reliable
b. Military: Name NA, Grade NA, Organization NA, Estimate of Reliability NA
8. Comments of reporting officer:
a. Action taken (agencies called, etc.) Griffiss AFB Control tower, Oneida Co. Airport Control Tower, FAA RAPCON and Utica Police.
Contacted: None of the agencies received any information or calls on the UFO, nor made any sightings.
b. Final evaluation (accuracy, reliability, timeliness, etc.) Numerous celebrations in this area, search lights to attract attention and commercial airplanes. This could have been the UFO or an aircraft in the area. There is very heavy air traffic on airfaring, V-1956, V-2, V-1255 and V-1-45 which all converge over the city of Utica. The most probable explanation is the observer sighted a reflection from a searchlight or the light of an aircraft on the airway.
