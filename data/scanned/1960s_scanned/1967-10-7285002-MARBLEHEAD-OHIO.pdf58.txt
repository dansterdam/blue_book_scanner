TACT/UFO (Maj. Quintanilla/70915/jaf/11 Oct 67)  
UFO Observation  

Plainfield, Ind. 46168  
Reference your letter of 9 Oct 1967. Thank you for bringing these cases to the attention of the Air Force, however, because these cases occurred so long ago, and cannot properly investigated, I can give no further consideration to this report. In the future similar sightings should occur, the nearest Air Force Installation should be immediately contacted so that a complete investigation can be made.  

Sincerely,
HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF  
Chief, Project Blue Book
