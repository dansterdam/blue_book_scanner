The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and a curved line labeled "B" to demonstrate how high the observed object was above the horizon (skyline) when it was first seen. The second sketch shows two larger sketches: one depicting a person standing on a road with buildings and hills in the background, and another smaller sketch showing a similar landscape with a curved horizon line.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position when you first saw the object, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
