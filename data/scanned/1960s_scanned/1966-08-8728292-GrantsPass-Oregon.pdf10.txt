The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page contains instructions and diagrams related to reporting the sighting of unidentified objects.

Output of the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

80° 75° 60° 45° 30° 15° 0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

But it could have been definitely going up & down too, no direction or movement can be determined from what we saw because it was gone too fast from our sight.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? All. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
