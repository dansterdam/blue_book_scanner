Major William T. Coleman
UFO Project Officer
Public Information Division, USAF
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Major Coleman:

On about 2100 hrs. on 30 Aug 61, a reddish object was seen over Richmond, Virginia. It suddenly exploded in a flash of white light. At the same time on the night of 7 Sep 61, the performance was repeated.

I would like to know the results of the official investigation into these sightings and that data on what this seems to indicate were these events based.

On 7 Aug 61 I requested information regarding the Chicago area sightings of 7 Aug 61. If possible, would you please inform me as to the action being taken on this request?

If a Department of Defense news release regarding UFO's has been issued since January, 1961, I would like to have a copy.

Your help in these matters would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Civilian UFO Research
