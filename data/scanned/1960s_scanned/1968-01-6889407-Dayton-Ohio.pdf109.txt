Transcription of the text:

From experience, I know that we will within the next thirty days receive a call from some of the interested parties to ascertain what we have done with or found out about the object so far. Anticipating this inquiry, I would appreciate if you could give me some progressive or interim feedback which would answer the questions.

Copies of my correspondence with Mrs. J. L. Green, who reported the finding of the object by telephone after learning of it from her neighbor, Mr. Videtto, and with Dr. Pursur are enclosed for your information on the action which I have taken to date.
