Analysis and Conclusions: The course of the object was consistent with the characteristics of a "balloon." Ball lightning was also considered due to the "ball-on-a-wire" type of motion, however, they were able to exclude this as an explanation. It was concluded in this case that the objects were probably balloons. However, in this time span, balloons would have been at an altitude of about 60,000 ft, there were no reports of any balloons being released from that location, and the size, color, and motion of the objects were not typical of balloons.
