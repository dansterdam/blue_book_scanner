MEMO for the Records

Contact was made with the Tonopah Test Range, Nevada in regards to recent unidentified flying object sightings in that area on 5 Dec 66. An interview with Mr. Allen Gerloy revealed that there was a launch at approximately 0645 on 5 Dec 66. At altitudes there were a bright bluish green cloud which should have been visible for many miles. There were several simulated re-entry vehicles which could have been visible for about 1530 minutes. The cloud should have been visible for about 5 to 10 minutes. This cloud was the only remarkable event on 5 Dec 66 which was not as obvious as the launch on 9 Dec 66. The launch on 9 Dec 66 produced a bright bluish green cloud.
