Dear Sir:

I thank you very much for sending me your letter sheets and upon reading them and upon reading past letters I am somewhat confused and not entirely sure what you would really like me to take up.

Usually myself, with the assistance of a technical staff and a team of physicists, meteorologists, astronomers and specialists in other fields, have been attempting to examine and evaluate, with much success, the reported sightings of unidentified flying objects.

But there is also qualitative evidence to be taken into consideration. The difficulty lies in distinguishing between the actual reports and the "wishful thinking" of the "little men."

This would lead one to make an inference as to the possible existence of unidentified flying objects. However, the findings of the measures of the adverse people in different countries, who have adopted a skeptical attitude, are just as valid. The closeness and the similarity of the reports are striking, but this may be just because of the short distances involved and the psychological factors involved.

It is thought that the incidents of "little men" which have been revealed are entirely imaginary and are psychomechanical conditions, perhaps similar to the "little man" hallucinations which spur on and sustain the beliefs of religious mystics.

It is clear that the close-range cases differ for there seems to be physical and tangible evidence. But even here there still remains the possibility that these are induced illusions or hallucinations - thus producing a subjective reality.

However, there is obviously a small percentage of reports which deserve further investigation, as they may provide information for advancing the technical and scientific level of our civilization. It is to these reports that we must devote our attention.
