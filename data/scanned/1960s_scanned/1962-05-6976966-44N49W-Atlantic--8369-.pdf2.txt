DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
On 6 May 1962, at 2240 EDT, a flight of two F-102 jet interceptors from the 32nd ADC Division were tracking an unidentified object by radar north of Bermuda at 44N 49W. The object was tracked by both aircraft for 15 minutes at speeds estimated between 1,000 and 3,000 knots. At one time the object was observed to make a rapid change in course.

CONCLUSIONS:
No positive identification was made of this object. The radar target appears to have been a valid target, but its identity and origin remain unknown.
