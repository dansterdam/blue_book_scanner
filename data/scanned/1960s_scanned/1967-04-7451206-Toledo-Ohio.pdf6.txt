DEAR SIR:

I am writing you this time not in asking for information, but in reporting to you about a UFO that I saw, along with five other people. This was seen on the night of April 7, 1967, at about 2110 hours.

Initial sighters in our group:
Mar.  (male), 37 years old, Toledo, Ohio 43614
Mr.  (male), 14 years old, Toledo, Ohio 43609 
Mr.  (male), 13 years old, Toledo, Ohio 43614
Mrs.  (female), 48 years old, Toledo, Ohio 43614

The object was first seen 7 April 1967, at 2110 hours.
E.S.T.

At this time we were approximately one hundred yards out of my driveway (which is on Ohio 43609) when I called the others to look at the object. 

The object was in sight for about twenty minutes. I know this because I kept running into the house to tell my mother and come back out. The object seemed to be hovering, no sound was heard. I and five of my friends were outside watching while I was inside.

The object was seen at night. There were many stars visible and the weather was clear. No clouds were visible and the weather was the clearest I have ever seen.
