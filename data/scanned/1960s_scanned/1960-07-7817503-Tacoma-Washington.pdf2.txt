j. Air Traffic
Normal commercial air traffic in and out of Lambert Field, St. Louis, Missouri. Considerable military air traffic at high altitude on strategic missions.
k. Position Title and Comments of Preparing Officer:
The phenomenon, combined with the instantaneous disappearance, would indicate that it might be a balloon, which eventually burst at high altitude. However, the Weather Bureau reported no balloons in the area, and stated that their balloons carry a white light, which burns only 5 minutes. It appears therefore that something unusual occurred which might make a closer examination desirable.
l. Physical Evidence - None.
