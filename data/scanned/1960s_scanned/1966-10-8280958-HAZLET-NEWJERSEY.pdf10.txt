Locations: South side of Rushville Ind. Near State Road 52 at a suburb.
Sky Conditions: Partly cloudy, to the west and north the clouds were.
Narrative: Donna Gosser, just happen to look up from the road where she was Gosser and saw the object almost directly overhead filling a space about half a minute more than 1/3 of the way across the sky. She said it looked triangular brass in color showing no lights and Douglas Gosser who were down the road on their bicycles said the object was large, bright, more than the size of a large bus and hovered motionless. She said it stood still but rocked slightly, little in the air. As she watched, the object slowly changed in color from the metallic shine with a faint glow on top, to a dull gray metallic shine and seemed to revolve, slowly tilted over higher to J 52 and in no more than two seconds seemed to start a instant drop about one block south over a houseand continue on a straight course until it went out of sight.
