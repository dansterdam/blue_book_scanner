GT-1 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE FOUR UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS LAUNCHED FROM THE GT-1 SPACECRAFT ON APRIL 8, 1964. OBJECTS OBSERVED WHICH WERE DETECTED ON RADAR HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS MINOR STRUCTURAL PIECES WHICH ROUTINELY BREAK AWAY FROM THE EXPENDABLE BOOSTER SECTION IN THE SPACECRAFT AND BOOSTER SEPARATION. THIS LEAVES NO EVIDENCE OF THE PRESENCE OF ANY MATERIAL THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE LAUNCHED VEHICLE.
