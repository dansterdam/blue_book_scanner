Dear Mr. Weiss:

This is in response to your letter of January 23, in which you reported observing an unidentified flying object.

Since this object had a southwesterly component, it would not seem to have been a known astronomical object. Although there are no high altitude aircraft over your area capable of producing such a sighting, the observation does not appear to have been of an aircraft. It was not on a regular schedule, nor was it on any other regular flight pattern. It was traveling at a speed higher than usual for known aircraft.

Enclosed is a brochure concerning the Air Force program on unidentified flying objects which may be of interest to you.

Thank you for reporting this observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

MARION M. JACKS
