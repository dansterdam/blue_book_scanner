There is a photograph present in the image, which appears to be a technical drawing or diagram of some sort. The image shows what look like sketches or drawings of objects, with text describing their estimated size and distance.

Kenneth Arnold Case
Arnold made drawings of objects showing definite shape and size. The objects appeared to be 40-50 feet long.
He also estimated the distance as 20-25 miles and clocked them as going 1,700 miles in 102 seconds.
These statements are mutually contradictory.
If the distance were correct, then in order for details to be visible, the objects must have been closer, of the order of 200 x 2,000 feet in size.
If, we adopt a reasonable size - Arnold's own estimate, in fact, of 50 feet long, hence about 3 feet wide, the objects must have been closer than 20 miles, possibly contray to his estimate.
It was adopt a reasonable limitation size to the objects of 30 x 400 feet. Objects must have been closer than six miles to have shown the detail indicated by Arnold. A regular speed of 1,700 m.p.h. appears much too high.
In all probability, therefore, objects were much closer than thought, and moving at definitely lower speeds.
No observational data taken from original Arnold raise. There were no witnesses or other observers to this incident.
