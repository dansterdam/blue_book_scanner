Text from the document:

It is said on the day of December 2, 1955, an unidentified object was seen in the sky over the City of Norwalk, Ohio about 8:15 pm. The object was observed for some fifteen to twenty minutes. The witness was Herman Waltenburger of the Ohop Road. He went to his car where eleven others were leaving for the night and told them of the object he had seen. The object hovered directly over the place where they were standing and then moved away to the northwest at a terrific rate of speed. The speed was so great that it left the observers breathless.
