Dear Col. Quintanillas:

Thank you for your letter of June 26th and for the attached information relating to UFO Report #17355. 

In placing both reports (yours and #17355) together on the map it appears both points saw the same object. If not, it would certainly merit a coincidence.

If I should happen to get any further word on this report (#17355) I will be certain to touch with you on the 26th inst.

Sincerely yours,

W.F. Roth, Project Director
Volunteer Flight Officer Network
