The text in the document is as follows:

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Astro(Capella)(Arcturus)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched star like objects in various parts of the sky. One object was in the NE and the other was in the WNW. The observers reported the objects as being stationary, although the objects did not disappear while they were being watched. One of the observers was occasionally contacted and on the night he was questioned, he was asked if he could see the object on Capella as the object he had been watching. He said he could and then pointed out the star Capella.
The description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. Capella was definitely identified as one of the objects the witness had been seeing.
