Dear Sir:
Upon thought it comes back that last year at New Years time I had a chance to see what was once described, might as well have been seen, as a strange object ascending in a large manner the sky, as if it was something quite usual to see such a thing, it did ascent rather slowly and gradually than with a sudden movement.

1) It was dark and airplan like 14 14 14 in the evening.
2) It alter its speed, size, changed in its brightness.
3) The object was a silver in color.
4) The color of the object changed.
5) The object was very fast.
6) As it ascended it seemed to speed up and come back toward the earth.
7) It seemed to start to rise over a period of 7 seconds.
8. It started in the north east and traveled in the motion east to west in the distance.

And I thank you for say, it helps me to know I was not just seeing a vision, cause many people of this area have said they have seen it at various times. I hope this report tells everything I saw, if you have any question, please let me know.

Yours truly
