U.S. Files to Draw GM Into Accident Suit
BY MORTON MINTZ
WASHINGTON-The United States is suing to bring General Motors into a lawsuit that says the Pontiac Tempest is a "hazardous design". 
But the government says, that's about all. The Tempest's driver and a passenger collided with a semitrailer, but the company could not be blamed, GM says.
The government filed the suit to get enough clout that if the Tempest's defects are proved, GM would be liable with the car's owner for any damages. The company says the government has attempted to "drag GM into the case as a defendant."
The government said that unless this is done, it will be impossible to assure that consumers injured by the Tempest will recover full damages.
U.S. Atty. Clifford A. Strove said that GM should be required to indemnify the government if it is found that the Tempest was a "hazardous design".
