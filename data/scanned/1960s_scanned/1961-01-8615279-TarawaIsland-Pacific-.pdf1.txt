10. CRIP' SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Very bright green to yellow flat elongated object w/tail rapidly moving in almost horizontal flight, turned out. Appeared altitude 2000-3000 ft.
11. COMMENTS: These were satellite-like objects - very bright at this time. Description and information is characteristic of a satellite turning out. These have been seen many times and they invariably turn out to be satellites or missile tracers and they are not really "Unidentified" in the strict sense.
Although the info reported is limited, appears that the information observed is not an "Unidentified Flying Object".
