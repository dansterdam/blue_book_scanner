There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document, possibly an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

my language y wlch eo not meet ane. lana and as meered al round oy head. looked up suddenly because of t strange noise that seemed to come fram the south east my way. it was a very bright object moving slowly and noiselessly. it was oval in shape like a saucer, silvery white in color and appeared to be rotating. it seemed to be about 1000 feet up and was moving in a northerly direction, at times hovering then moving on. it remained in sight for about 3 minutes then disappeared behind some trees. although it was a cold clear night, I did not see any exhaust or glow from the object. I just stood and watched it, there being no one else around that I could see. I have no other explanation for what I saw. I am a sober reliable citizen and have never before reported anything unusual. I am simply reporting what I saw that night.
