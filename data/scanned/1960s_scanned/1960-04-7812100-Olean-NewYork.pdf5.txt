The Olean, New York sighting of 16 April 1960, has been evaluated. 
The ATIC conclusion is that birds were the probable cause of this sighting.

REMARKS: The answer here is that there is not sufficient information for a definite conclusion. Preliminary analysis indicates the possibility that it was migrating birds flying high. You cannot rule out the $10,000 fine.
