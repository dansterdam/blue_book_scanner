MEMO FOR THE RECORD
UFO OBSERVATION: 2 January 1968
Mrs. [redacted], Annapolis, Md 21401
called/to inform us of her UFO observation. She didn't think too much
of it until there were items about the observation in the newspaper.
The objects were flying about the same rate of speed as that of an
airplane, about five minutes. One of the captains on a steamer
on the bay noticed it over the bow's her lm of the ship and radioed
into shore. Saw them at about 930 pm flying across the bay, one
after the other, they weren't airplanes. There a NICE site nearby
and until we found out that there were hundreds of reports by the
Bay Police we began to wonder. The objects didn't come from the
earth, they went out over the bay, about every three minutes and
disappeared, while round, flew at one level and just saw them and they
disappeared.
