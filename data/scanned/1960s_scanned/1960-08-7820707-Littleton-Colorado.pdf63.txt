Amazon & scary thought of the past - the scene Arose at the time 1959 - this was undoubtedly seen in 1958 - My wife saw it and carefully lead my eye to it; insisted I must see it - it measured generally about 25 feet in diameter and was hovering 25 to 30 feet above the ground and ahead of us in the area - Littleton, Colorado.
When this object came into my area from the north, I thought it was an aircraft below the clouds or
a low flying plane. But then I looked more carefully and saw that it was not an aircraft or anything I was familiar with. It was quite steady, perfectly still, and bright - some kind of luminous whitish color. There were no lights or openings on the object - it appeared as a uniformly lighted round object, higher and larger than a normal aircraft. After several minutes it slowly moved westward, maintaining its great altitude, and simply disappeared out of sight - no sound, no vapor trails, just disappeared. My little story has remained firmly in mind and has been a curiosity over the years.
