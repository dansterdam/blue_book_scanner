The image contains two illustrations. The one on the left is a compass-like diagram with various directional labels. The text below it describes how this diagram is used to schematically show the movement of the observed phenomenon between 4:45 and 5:15. 

The image on the right contains two sketches. The larger one depicts a human figure standing on a road with mountains or hills in the background. The smaller one shows a lighthouse-like structure against a scenic landscape.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "0" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "0" WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "0". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT ORIGINATED TO SOUTHEAST, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAGGED, ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS DESCRIPTION.
