Statement, included at Blue Book, to the effect that was not moving except when the witness could travel it is absolutely incorrect, if the witness is to be believed.  It stated that the object appeared suddenly, passed up and smashed away with speed.  With respect to the light, witness stated, "there is nothing to compare with the brilliant".

Finally, witness became frightened because object came closer and yet said there was no sound.  Unless one is willing to call this an absolute hallucination, there was no physical effect present whatever, the object disappeared.

This case is sufficiently interesting for me to interview witnesses, as there were two rather than one as stated.  I will make this personal investigation and report it.

I would agree with the evaluation of possible birds, suppose to be fair we should add, possible unidentified, no followup. The card indicates one object observed flying in V formation. This actually strengthens "possible birds" evaluation.

Sighting, as witness was never submitted. I suppose, is entirely correct, but the case itself is interesting, in that there were 15 witnesses. Here is one case that should have looked into, since it was right at their back door. Also the object was visible for 15 minutes, and it was observed telescope, even at this late date this might be worth a matter of fact, when I am Boulder this day I will look into the case, but the evaluation "insufficient" certainly holds.
