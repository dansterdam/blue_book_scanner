And the last one I hope--04502. 6 lights red and green flashing and stationary. Approximately 55 miles southeast Cheyenne, 30 degrees above horizon. Observed 15 minutes. Used binoculars: All objects size of a pin head. Weather is the same as before winds calm. Four Air Force personnel observed sighting. That's all I have. Did you give this to NORAD. Not yet. Will you, Yes I will.
