There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Could you compare it in size to any known object? A baseball or a pea or anything?
Oh, I would say that it was much bigger than that. I would say it was up in 25ft in diameter or something like that.
I mean at the distance, what would you compare the size with? 
Oh, a basketball, probably.
Could you determine any color?
The color would be a light shining on it would appear to be gray. The shiny part would be a flame color--a bright brilliant flame color. 
Was there anything else that you would associate with a manned aircraft such as a vapor trail, or an exhaust or a tail section or a wing section?
No, nothing like that was visible.
Was there any sound at this time?
NO.
What would you estimate the altitude and the distance to be?
I would estimate the altitude at the lower part of it to be around 15,000 ft and it extended on up to maybe 20,000.
That was a different time when it moved up?
Yes.
And could you estimate the distance?
My estimation of the distance from here would be 15-20 miles.
Could you describe the flight path or maneuvers?
During the observation it would be climbing, changing altitude, it seemed to go to the east for some time and hover in one position then the last I remember it was going west-climbing and going west.
Would these maneuvers be at a rapid speed?
No, some of them would be slow. I recall one time that it climbed quite fast. 
And there would be abrupt changes of direction?
Yes.
And about how long did you observe this?
