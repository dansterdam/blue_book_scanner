This replies to your recent correspondence regarding your unidentified observation. At this late date, a meaningful scientific investigation is not possible. It is important for an individual to report his observation to the proper authorities. However, the civilian agencies will be filled for information purposes only. 

To date, there has been a total lack of tangible evidence to indicate our planes has or is being visited by extraterrestrial vehicles.

Thank you for your interest in the Air Force's UFO program.

Sincerely,

BARRETT B. YOUNG
