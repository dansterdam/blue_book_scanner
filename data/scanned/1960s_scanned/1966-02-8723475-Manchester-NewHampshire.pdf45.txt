Dear Sir:
Reference your letter of 27 April 1966 requesting the status of your unidentified object report.
I am sorry for the delay in returning your negative and two prints. It will take longer to process associated data and to evaluate your sightinq. Upon completion of analysis we will return your original negative along with two prints and a copy of the photo analysis.
Your concern for this project is appreciated.

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
