KIEL, WISCONSIN 
6 JULY 1965

Observer was outside looking at the sky at approximately 2130 when she noticed an object which first looked like a shooting star, but the flight was flashing on and off. ECHO I was visible in the sky at this time and this object moved in orbit across the sky passing ECHO I as it crossed the zenith. The object disappeared in the east after having been visible for less than a minute. Its size was comparable with a star and was pulsating as though somebody was turning a flashlight on and off. It was about one flash per second, or somewhat less. There were no other colored lights visible. There was no sound whatever, and the sky was very clear. It traversed the entire sky from west to quite low in the east, a total of perhaps 150Â° in less than a minute.

COMMENTS
Due to the reported data a meteor and a balloon is completely ruled out. 
The observer was positive there was no moon, but at 2130 the moon, being at first quarter, should have been in the southwest. The observer was positive that the object was not an aircraft because she can definitely identify such. The statement that the objects followed the "circle of the heavens" was stressed by the witness. Due to the available information, the case is carried as unidentified by the Air Force. A satellite is a logical explanation; however, the available data does not warrant such an explanation.
