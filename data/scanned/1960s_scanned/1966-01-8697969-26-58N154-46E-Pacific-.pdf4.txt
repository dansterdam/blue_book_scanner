STATEMENT OF GLENN T. DAVIS, MASTER:
I was prior to 2200 ship ALTO, January 12, 1966. I was in my bunk below decks when called to the bridge. Three lights were seen to the East and were moving rapidly toward the ship. The lights appeared to be about 20-25 miles away and as they approached, they seemed to form into one object. The object, which gave off a steady glow, appeared to be about the size of a basketball.
As it came closer, 2 small lights blinked on and off on the object. The object then seemed to stop and hover off the starboard side of the ship at an estimated distance of 1-1.5 miles. It remained stationary for approximately 30 seconds then accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed, streaking away to the South. The entire incident lasted less than 1 minute.
At 2230, the vessel sighted another Williams-on-type phenomenon. It was oblong in shape, about 60-70 feet in length and 20-25 feet in width. It was a bright red-orange color and gave off a steady glow. The object hovered at an altitude of approximately 500 feet for about 2 minutes, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight.
These were two 120 phone calls from the bost. The names and addresses of the witnesses are known but I do not have authority to release them.
