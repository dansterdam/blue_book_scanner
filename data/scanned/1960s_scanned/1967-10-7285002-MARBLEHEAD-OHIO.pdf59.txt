Gentlemen:
Please have this sighting on our file. Some of the data we, cant substantiate.

1. Sighting on Oct. 6, at approximately 10:00 to 10:30 p.m. near Marblehead, Ohio. A group of four people were driving a car. While driving, they observed at high altitude four large bright object moving in a westerly direction at a high rate of speed. [Redacted] They were driving another car 1/2 mile behind them, and the persons in this car also observed the objects. There were approximately fifteen seconds between the two sightings which, they believe, showed the same objects.  It was like a flight of geese, and there were four objects in "V" formation. It was estimated the objects were operating at a speed of approximately 5,000 mph. The objects were observed for about 15 to 20 seconds.

[Redacted] how that can be some credence to the report as the persons who [Redacted] and [Redacted] were of high caliber, intelligent and, we believe, not the type to make up stories. [Redacted].
