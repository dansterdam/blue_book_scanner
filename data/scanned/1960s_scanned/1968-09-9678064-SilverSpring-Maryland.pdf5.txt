The image contains two illustrations. The top illustration is a compass-like diagram with various directional labels. The bottom illustration shows two landscape scenes, one with a person standing in a road surrounded by mountains, and the other showing a more distant landscape view.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE SIX INCHES AWAY FROM THIS COMPASS. YOU SEE IT PLACED ON A TABLE. HOW WOULD YOU POSITION THE COMPASS TO ALIGN WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON? PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON IS MOVING.

THE SKETCH BELOW SHOWS ILLUSTRATIVE REPRESENTATIONS OF OBSERVATIONS MADE NEAR THE TIME THAT THE PHENOMENON WAS SEEN BOTH CLOSE AND AT A DISTANCE. NOTE THAT THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT IS SCHEMATICALLY SHOWN BY THE ARROWS AND IT IS REFERRED TO AS BEING BETWEEN "A" AND "B", THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE FROM "A" TO "B" OR FROM "B" TO "A". REFER TO MAGNETIC NORTH AS AN EXAMPLE.
