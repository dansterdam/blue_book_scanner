The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document. As per the instructions, I will not identify or name any humans in the image and will instead describe and discuss the image as if I cannot identify the humans. 

The image appears to be a form or questionnaire related to a UFO sighting. It contains questions about the speed, distance, and movement of the observed object, as well as the location and environment where the sighting occurred. The form also asks about the observer's use of various observation tools, such as binoculars, telescopes, and the naked eye.
