The image contains a hand-drawn sketch showing a compass rose and a series of angular lines. There does not appear to be a photograph present in this particular page of the document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are the observer. Place a dot at the point where the horizon (skyline) would be. From that point, show how high the object you saw was, in degrees, by placing a line at the angle (in degrees) that you first saw it. Place a dot on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "Y" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
