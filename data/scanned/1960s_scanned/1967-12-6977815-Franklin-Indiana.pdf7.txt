The image contains a photograph that appears to be part of a UFO sighting report from Project Blue Book. The photograph shows a sketch or drawing of a UFO sighting, including details about the object's size, speed, altitude, and appearance.

Here is the full text transcribed from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
Flew over horizon out of sight

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One) YES   (Don't Know)      IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

A rotating path 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - deep humming - like the sound of a power plant
b. Color - red and green lights flashing in order

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick in line with a known object and tell how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19.5 foot at 150 yds, 100 yrs altitude, speed about 160 mph

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
