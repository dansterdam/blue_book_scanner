"They Saw Those
Bethel 'Saucers'"
Burlington, Vt, Jan, 21---(AP)---Three members of a Bethel, Vt. family reported to Vermont State Police today that they had seen unusual objects in the sky on the evening of Jan 18. 
Bernard S. Woodruff, told police that about 5:45 p.m. on that date, he and his wife and son saw three bright, luminous objects in the sky moving in an erratic manner. He said the objects, which appeared to be about 1,000 feet up, were at first stationary and then moved rapidly off in different directions.
Woodruff said a short while later the three objects reappeared and again moved about erratically in the sky. He estimated they were visible about five minutes on each occasion.
No sound was heard, Woodruff said, and the objects appeared to be about the size of a basketball when seen.
The Woodruff family were among a number of Vermonters who said they saw unexplained objects in the sky on the evening of Jan. 18.
