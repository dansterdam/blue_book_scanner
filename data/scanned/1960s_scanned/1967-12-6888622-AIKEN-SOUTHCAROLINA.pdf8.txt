The image contains a hand-drawn diagram that appears to be part of a UFO report document. The diagram consists of an oval shape with three upward-pointing arrows below it. There does not appear to be a photograph on this page.

Transcribing the text in the document:

IS WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT OR HOUSE. HOW LARGE DID THE OBJECT APPEAR IN COMPARISON TO THE MATCH? IF POSSIBLE, DETERMINE THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT PROJECTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
