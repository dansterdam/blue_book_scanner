Up until this point in the incident, Mrs. [REDACTED] had thought there were those of a single object. However, the new formation seemed to be her that there were two objects. After watching the object for a short time, Mrs. [REDACTED] the car and drove Mrs. [REDACTED] home, returning to the area a few minutes later. The whole object was visible to them and appeared to the northwest, hovering low over the ground. They drove to a point from which they could have a better view of the object and saw that it appeared to be metallic and seemed to have some appendages or arms attached to the lower portion. Mrs. [REDACTED] was unable to estimate the speed of the object that the whole incident seemed to happen very fast. She was impressed with airplanes since her husband is a student pilot. She heads the object, the name "flying saucer" and still thinks there is some commonplace explanation.
