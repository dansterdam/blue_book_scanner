The image does not appear to contain any photograph. It is a typed document with text describing an unidentified object that was observed. I will now proceed to transcribe the text from the document:

If you will imagine a photograph of a nearly spherical, luminous object that the sky, you will see about 10 feet in diameter, hovering over a pine grove about half a mile away. It would appear to be about 200 feet above the ground and you will be pretty close to the actual objects and your interpretation.  

SPECULATION: The object that I saw maneuvered in a peculiar way. From the time the object was first observed, it maintained a steady hovering position, but about 30 seconds later it moved rapidly toward the observer at an extremely low altitude, estimated to be approximately 200 feet above the ground. It then hovered again for about 1 minute and then suddenly shot upward at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight.  This was a very amazing and very possibly much closer than this.

SPECULATION: Therefore I would eliminate all of these (and I have not come upon them) except one, and that is the unpredicted that I had never observed nor, to my best knowledge, observed by others before. Before going into this, I should say that I have observed many aircraft, artificial satellites, birds, and other objects and know quite well how they behave. But this was definitely much different - no wings, no sound, just silently hovering and then darting at an unbelievable speed.

Because of my skepticism, I have left this for some time. But that of UAPO, which I've read about, is now troubling me a bit. I've become interested in the question whether they exist. What is your opinion. I will be glad if you can give me a rational explanation.
