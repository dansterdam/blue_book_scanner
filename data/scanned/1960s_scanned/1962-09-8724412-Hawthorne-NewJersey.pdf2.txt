Dear Major Hart:

On September 20, 21, 22 and 24, 1962 an unidentified flying object was seen frequently over the cities of Clifton, Paterson and Hawthorne, New Jersey. On the night of September 23 one was observed in Clifton. These were seen by a number of citizens and were described as circular in shape and about the size of a large automobile. They were observed over the same general area during the early evening hours of these dates. I am enclosing copies of the reports. 

On September 20, 21 and 24 a UFO was observed by several citizens in Clifton, Paterson and Hawthorne, New Jersey, New Jersey, within a 40-mile radius, for about twenty minutes. Contacted and checked for additional details.

On September 23 a Mrs. Lee and her son, Emeling Drive, Hawthorne, N.J., in the evening, saw an object moving at a fantastic speed.

On the night of September 24 two Hawthorne policemen sighted an object similar to the one described.

I understand that the Air Force is aware of these sightings. 

Sincerely,
G. Dale Davis
