Dear Mr. [Redacted],

This will confirm our telephone conversation of this date concerning the unidentified flying object reported by your.

Since you furnished insufficient information for a complete analysis, I am unable to initiate any further action on this case at this time. However, I am returning the completed document to the commander, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, for any additional action he may wish to take.

Also included for your information is the latest department of defense statement on the subject of unidentified flying objects. This statement outlines the position of the Department of Defense and the Department of the Air Force regarding unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
