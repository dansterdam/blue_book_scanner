WASHINGTON, D.C.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

December 22, 1957

Dear [Redacted],

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without essential information, such as detailed flight characteristics, singularity or visibility of the phenomenon, or witnesses to corroborate the observation, this office is unable to conduct a scientific investigation. Had you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
