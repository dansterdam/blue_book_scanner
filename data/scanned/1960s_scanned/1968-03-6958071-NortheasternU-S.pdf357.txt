The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter describing the observation of three unidentified objects in flight.

I watched these three objects in flight for approximately five minutes. I watched intermittently in order to be able to continue to watch the road and drive safely. At the end of that time, after a period of watching the road and traffic around me, I looked up again and noted that the three objects were no longer in sight.

Two characteristics of these objects interest me especially: 
(1) The tail extending back from each object was distinctly golden in color, and therefore was unlike the jet exhaust or rocket engine I have ever seen before.
(2) The three objects, flying in a consistent formation, executed a distinct curve in their flight path. This was unmistakable: the lead object first entered the curve, swinging out toward the left (west) horizon; and then the following two objects followed the same curving course; then the three of them straightened out again toward the north-northeast. At one point in this trajectory, each till was unmistakable.

I should appreciate it if you will pass this information along to Blue Book, with any comments you might care to make. If it should be useful to the Air Force in any way, I should be glad to reconfirm these details in an interview.

Many thanks, and best wishes,
Sincerely,
