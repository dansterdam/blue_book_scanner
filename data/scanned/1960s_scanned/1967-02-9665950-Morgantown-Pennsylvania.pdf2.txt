P.O. Box
Dear Sir:
Thank you for your report, which Lt. Marley has forwarded to me for comment. Your calculations appear correct in principle, but the speed could not have been calculated under the assumption of a straight course, as the object was apparently taking a very erratic course when the object was sighted. The calculation done in that way gives AAO mph.

The only part of the sighting which does not fit the description of a conventional aircraft is the very bright light, which is not ordinarily seen. 

I say ordinarily. Actually the hatch you calculated would indicate a jet aircraft size (over 20,000 ft. usually). It is a common for jet aircraft climbing through transsonic speeds to appear much brighter than normal. Are concentrated forward in a moderately wide beam.

I have done some calculations on the brightness of these light at various distances, and found, for example, that a 1,000 candlepower light, concentrated to a 20-degree beam will appear as bright as Venus (about -4 magnitude) at a distance of 30 miles. Thus the bright light does not strike me as unusual.
