U.A.O. SCOUTS TOWN IN EAST
Mrs. Evelyn Charney and her son Steven, 16, were sitting outside their home in Westford, Mass., at 9:40 P.M. on April 9, 1965, when they observed an unusual bright object in the sky. There was no sound but the object was so bright that it illuminated the ground over a distance of 1 mile away. The library is located in the Center of Westford and its high elevation for miles around. Upon leaving, Mrs. Charney stopped at the library steps and both spotted a bright red light and what appeared to be a very narrow window.
As Mrs. Charney watched, the object started a slow wide turn to its left, and Mrs. Charney glanced up to her son who was pointing out something else in the sky. When she looked back, the object was continuing in its turn for several minutes, always holding the same shape and brightness.
The object moved past the high school, the red lights seemed to dim and the "windows" gleamed brightly. It passed to the other side of the hill and disappeared. Mrs. Charney timed the sighting from the moment the object appeared until it was out of sight - this was approximately 15 minutes. The diagrams illustrate the route of the object seen at Westford Center, as seen by Mrs. Charney's route during her observation of it. The Charneys then saw two other aircraft circling Westford and they continued to do so for 30 or 40 minutes, much higher than the UFO.
