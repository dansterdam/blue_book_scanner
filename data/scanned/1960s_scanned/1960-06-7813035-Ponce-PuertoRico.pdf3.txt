UFO Sightings, Puerto Rico, 
SAFOI-3d (I/Col Tacker)

1. The planet was observed from the witnesses' home town. The planet was only visible about 5-10 seconds for a brief period of time, and was of magnitude 3-4 on 1 June 1960.

2. It is a new and novel experiences for people to see planets in the daytime, and few know that it can be done without a telescope.

3. In the past, there have been cases of prolonged staring at an unidentified object so very bright as to be blinding - the so-called "flaming object" experience.

4. It is quite understandable that the planet was lost to the witnesses, for the suddenness of its appearance and disappearance was quite natural if the planet was only seen for 5-10 seconds.
