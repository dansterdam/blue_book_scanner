The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be some kind of aerial object or phenomenon. The sketch shows a bright light or object with a dimmer light or object nearby, and the text underneath states "The object has a bright light satellite or gases?".

Output of the OCR text:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? NO

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? YES (IF you answered YES, then tell what behind it moved... bright light dim in the sky)

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? NO (IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of it moved...)

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: 
a. Sound No sound
b. Color White or pale yellow

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 2 to 3 degrees

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object you have described such as wings, protrusions, etc.; and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
