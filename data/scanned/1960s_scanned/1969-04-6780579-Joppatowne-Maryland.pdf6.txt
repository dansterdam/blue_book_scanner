The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no visible photograph or image included on this page. The text on the page appears to be a handwritten letter addressed to "Gentlemen:" expressing the writer's interest in astronomy and asking to receive some pictures that were mentioned. The writer also requests that the answer be mailed to them.

Gentlemen:
I am 14 years old and am very interested in astronomy. Well recently it mentioned on the news that you will send me some information on the planet Venus. I was wondering if you can send me some pictures that were taken on April 22, 1969-16" sun diameter telescope observation space) of the moon. In one picture I found this strange array of holes. Will you please send me the answer to this as soon as possible. 
Thank you very much.
