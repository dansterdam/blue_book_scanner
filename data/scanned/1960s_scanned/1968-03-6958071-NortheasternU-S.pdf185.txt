became visible before seen at S69, and the end point is even more right to the original two bodies disintegrating into many, so persons at different distances would see a different end. However, the 1122 length and the given 11 and 12' fully define the coordinates of the atmospheric path.

Observers in general reported a practically horizontal path. Some further south reported two objects and that, as the object continued on it broke into more separate pieces, until near the end it became practically a "shoal" or fragments, moving in parallel paths, many times as long as broad. No long enduring trail was reported. As to brightness, it certainly was much less than full Moon, but several reported it as brighter than Venus. It showed a definite disk. There was more than usual agreement that the color was white-red. 

As to the velocity in our atmosphere, we have 23 estimates running from 6 sec. to 6 min. The estimates are complicated in that some say only part of the path, also that nobody had a stop-watch, and for durations of over 10 seconds estimated durations are subject to great errors.

About this time, I was informed that the Space Defense Center was predicting the decay of debris from found b into the atmosphere for the time and along the same ground trace as observed for the problem in question. Since the velocity would have been on the order of 5-7
