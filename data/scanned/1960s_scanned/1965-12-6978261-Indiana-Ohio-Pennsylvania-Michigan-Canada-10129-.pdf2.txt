AERIAL PHENOMENA SIGHTED
NEAR KINGSTON, ONTARIO
1. On 6 December 1965 at approximately 7:55 p.m., RADAR OPERATOR JOHN FORJOE of R.C.A.F. Station Trenton, Ontario, observed an unidentified airborne object on the radar scope. The object was located over Lake Ontario, approximately 8 miles southeast of Kingston, Ontario.
2. At the same time, the SHIFT SUPERVISOR, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER ARTHUR TURNER, also observed the unidentified object on the radar scope. Both observers described the object as a "strong, fast-moving target".
3. The object was tracked for approximately 5 minutes, during which time it traveled a distance of approximately 50 miles. The object then disappeared from the radar scope.
4. No other aircraft were reported in the area at the time. Weather conditions were good, with visibility of 10-15 miles.
