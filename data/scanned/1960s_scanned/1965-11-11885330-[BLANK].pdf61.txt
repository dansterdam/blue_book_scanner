Appendix II
Preliminary Balloon Flights

The proposal outlined in the body of this paper represents what probably would be the most sophisticated package to be used in the program of balloon flight experiments. Such a device represents a great deal of engineering, ground testing and construction time, and the first balloon flight for the entire system would probably not take place until between one and two years after the program started. In the meantime, several smaller pieces of apparatus must be flown in order to test certain of the experimental techniques. Some physics would come out of these first flights. The following paragraphs describe the nature of these first few preliminary balloon flights, and what results would be expected of each. It is unrealistic to list more than a few of the anticipated test flights, because the information from the first few flights will undoubtedly determine the nature and number of further test flights. At the end of the appendix, there is a discussion of alternate configurations to the one proposed in this paper which might provide useful physics later.

Flight 1 and 2
The first flight would probably take place about six months after the beginning of the program. The principal function of this flight would be to test the operation of the Cerenkov trigger system. The most important information from this flight would relate to the durability and opacity of the light tight Cerenkov gas enclosure, and the detecting efficiency of the device. In the first flights, the launching procedure for the rather bulky Cerenkov gas enclosure would be tested.
