UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING REPORT

On June 6, 1968, at approximately 11:15 p.m., Mr. J. Smith and Mrs. M. Johnson were driving south on Highway 61 near Davenport, Iowa, when they observed a bright light in the sky. 

The object appeared to be oval in shape and was emitting a bright glow. It hovered in the sky for several minutes before disappearing rapidly.

Mr. Smith and Mrs. Johnson stopped their vehicle and watched the object for approximately 5 minutes before it vanished from sight. They could not determine the size, altitude, or speed of the object due to the darkness and distance.

No other witnesses were reported, and no physical evidence was collected. This incident was investigated and documented as part of Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects.
