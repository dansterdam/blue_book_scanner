The image contains two sketches, but no photographs.

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline) and an object above it. The observer is instructed to mark point "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when they first saw it.

The second sketch shows a larger landscape view with the object's position marked as "A" and its position at a later time marked as "B", to demonstrate how the object's position changed over time.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.
33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was in when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
