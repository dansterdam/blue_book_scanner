and I noted the brush was burning in several places. At that time I heard Sgt Chaves, (NM State Police at Socorro) calling me on radio for my location. And I returned to my car, told him he was looking at me. What the trouble was, because it was sweating and he told me it was white, very pale. I asked the Sgt. to see what I saw, and that was the burning brush. 
  Then Sgt Chaves and I went to the spot, and Sgt. Chaves pointed out the tracks.

When I first saw the object (when I thought it might be a car) I saw what appeared to be two legs or some type from the object to the ground. At the time, I didn't pay much attention to what it appeared showed at was an accident--I saw the two persons. I didn't pay any attention to the two "legs" The two "legs" were at the bottom of the object, slanted outwards to the ground. The object might have been about three feet from the ground--I can't tell how long saw object second time (the "close" time), possibly 20 seconds--just a guess--as time got out of car, glanced at object, ran from object, jumped in car.

As my mile fell  I got out of car, swam at scene area, I heard about somewhere loud "thumps" like someone possibly hammering or chatting around a door or doors hard. These "thumps" were possibly a second or less apart. This was just before the scene.

The persons were not seen when I got up to the scene area. 

Just before Sgt. Chaves got to scene, I got my pen and drew a picture of the insignia on the object.
