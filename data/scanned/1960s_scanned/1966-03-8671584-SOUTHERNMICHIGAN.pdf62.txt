vehicle the lights would have proceeded with a lumpy motion because of the irregularities in the terrain. Mr. indicated that the glow in various parts of the swamp lasted for 2 - 3 hours. 

The stories of Mr. and Deputies Mc Fadden do not of exactly agree here but this might be due to their different advantage points.

During their trek towards the swamp (incidently they never arrived at their objective, furthermore never getting closer than 300 yards) they stated that as they came closer to the swamp they saw an oval object depicted in figures 3 & 4. Deputy Mc Fadden advised that he was close to the object and indicated to me that he had not seen the object himself. Manner and his son described the vehicle as a brownish oval with a green and white light at the opposite ends of the longitudial axis and a bright red elongated light in between the two.

When the officers returned to their patrol car they found two other patrol cars there. Deputy Gaskill and his wife/were in one car, and Officer Gorsuch the returning officers whether they had seen the lights directly above them. Gaskill stated that four lights were hovering directly above the officers while they were conducting their search in the swamp. One of the lights came directly towards his car, causing it to slightly to the right. Mrs. Gaskill had rolled the window down and peering out, stated that she observed the ball of light to pass very close to the car. Officer Gaskill had turned the car motor off to check whether any sound came from the ball of light. As he restarted the car motor, the lights disappeared.
