Dear President Johnson:

On Sunday night, when I was out in my yard, I saw a flashing light which was bright and seemed to be moving around from place to place over in the distance. It was just like the lights an aircraft would have, but I could not make out an aircraft itself. I just thought it was a few minutes.  

Monday night, on the 10:00 P.M. news, we spotted over Portugese village and another place that a flying saucer was sighted. The description of it was exactly what I had seen. The saucer lights in the sky over my yard a few minutes. I just wanted to tell you.

Yours truly,
