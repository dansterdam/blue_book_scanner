The text in the document says:

The second week of Jan 1967 about 9:30 PM I heard and felt something big go over our house. I went out on our front porch, which is 30 feet above the street level and had the shock of my life. There was a light pattern in the sky the likes of nothing I have ever before.

4' emerald green
leger than red lights

white light 
about here

the curved lines

The white light appeared to be under the craft, and loud roar or humming of some kind. It was HUGH AND MOVED SLOWLY AT 600 to 1000 feet. Oaklans hills are 1,500 feet; it was well below that. I watch it go toward the Oakland hills NE, half or a third of the way to the hills. It did or appeared to do so, I got the impression it might be round, because of the light gray curved lines I saw; the craft was dark in color. At that height, I should have seen, A TAIL AND WINGS but none were to be seen. The triangle of red lights stayed pretty much in a horizontal position.

To the south was a stratoliner about 3,000 feet heading SW and going East by North was a fan jet about 2,000 feet, all three craft were in my line of vision. 

I keep telling my self this was a two tail air craft, but I still do not know what I saw.
