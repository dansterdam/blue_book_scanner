"December 6, 1963

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Referring to your letter of November 16, 1963, and information from your form for 9/29/63, your sighting was undoubtedly a meteor. However, messors [REDACTED] with a meeting attending on 11/30, the sightings up to that point seemed to be colored lights, and this was the subject of the meeting.

1. All satellite devices leaving an easterly component;
2. Decay is phenomenized by a breaking up or the object tends to be sad up change;
3. Duration of satellite is much greater than the passing of two minutes, for example, Sputnik IV launched for 4300 of seconds was our attention toward a passing meteor.

A case summary of the August 4, 1963 sighting is attached. At no time did the Air Force attempt to identify aircraft in the sighting however, certain it was not an airplane or any other type of aircraft known to the Air Force. The evaluation shows this sighting was too difficult to determine its exact nature. I did not see them.

For example: Aircraft flying overheard at varying altitudes cannot be identified at times, but the Air Force has no information on "guiding incising" in relation to this case."
