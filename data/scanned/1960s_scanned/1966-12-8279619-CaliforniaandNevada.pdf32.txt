MYSTERY IN THE SKIES
THE EERIE GREEN LIGHTS
GREEN GLOB HOVERS IN LV HEAVENS
A pair of high-altitude experimental rockets fired northwest of Las Vegas shortly after dark yesterday, resulted in an eerie green glow over Southern Nevada startling thousands of residents.
They were seen for 15 minutes over the entire western Las Vegas from Southern California to Colorado. 
Their presence, according to the Air Force, was due to chemicals in the rockets, including nitric and ammonia layers in the rarified atmosphere.
The rockets, launched with fantastic speed, poured out the strange green glow, which undulated and shimmered in the night sky.
