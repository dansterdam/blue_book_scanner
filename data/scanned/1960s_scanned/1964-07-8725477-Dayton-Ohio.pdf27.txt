The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

say a bright moving object like a star on 19 Jul 54, calls local time,
going East & West at high speed. He was passing North. Object was top
