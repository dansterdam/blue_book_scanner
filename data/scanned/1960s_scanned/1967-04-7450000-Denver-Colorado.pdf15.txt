Dear -

The Secretary of Defense referred your letter concerning the unidentified flying object (UFO) which you have sighted to our office for reply.

Within the Department of Defense the Air Force has the responsibility of investigating UFO reports to us and determining whether or not these objects constitute a threat to our national security. This program is carried out under the direction of Project Blue Book which is explained in the attached brochure.

Project Blue Book personnel at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, report that they have not received any UFO reports from your area.

I have attached an FTD Form 154 which is used in officially reporting a sighting to the Air Force. If you will complete this form as an attempt will be made to evaluate the sighting in your area. You may use the attached envelope to mail the completed form.

I hope this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
