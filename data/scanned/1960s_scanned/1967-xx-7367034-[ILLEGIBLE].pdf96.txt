The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book UFO report, with handwritten text.

It seems the witness is describing something they observed, mentioning "the bright shape" and "a slow movement upwards". However, there is no visual representation of what they witnessed included in this particular page.

Now, acting as an OCR (optical character recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

"IT DOES A FURTHER INDICATE, IF SHOWN, THE SHAPE OF THEHPHENOMENON. INCLUDE ALSO ALL DETAILS THAT MIGHT INDICATE THE MANNER IN WHICH THEPHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

At times the phenomenon appeared to be of a bright shape, only the night and a slow movement upwards."
