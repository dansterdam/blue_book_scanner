The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch shows instructions for a hypothetical UFO sighting, with labels for the position and direction of the observed object relative to the observer's position.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the horizon where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the horizon where the object was below the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion or the object or objects made. Place an "A" or a "B" on the path, or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
