The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an official U.S. Air Force document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate UFO sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

I was leaving my house and just as I stepped back onto the porch I noticed this object. This object was hovering and changing colors. It called my mother and sisters while she watched it. I got my binoculars and got a short look at the object just before it went behind the hill. It appeared the same as it did to the eye. I then later up Maple Ave to see it again, which I did. I have counted out because it moved to slowly and helicopter because that close would make a lot of noise.
