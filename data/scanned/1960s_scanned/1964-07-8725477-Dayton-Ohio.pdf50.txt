This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page includes a series of questions and responses related to the details of an observed UFO sighting.

The text output is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length in line with a known object and move the object so the length of the match head just covers the object. If you have performed this experiment, or the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
