The brilliant visible light fifteen to twenty times longer than the diameter of the object, and basic information was confirmed by A/C Pitcher also on duty at the Chanute Air Force Base.

A/1C Boudreaux, Project Officer had been alerted for possible re-entry of Satellite 1958 ALPHA from 0730Z 6 June to 0730Z 7 July. After reported sightings at 0730Z on 7 July, the object of the 0952 sighting is believed to be the possible re-entry of Satellite 1958 ALPHA. An inquiry of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory confirms that the re-entry of Satellite 1958 ALPHA could case starting to re-enter the earth's atmosphere. No further sightings have been reported as of 2 July 1960.

RECOMMENDATIONS: In that all possible leads indicate the possibility of a re-entry of a satellite, it is recommended that no further action be taken at this station.
