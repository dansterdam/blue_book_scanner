The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

6. At 1900 hours the witness reported the object to be moving in a SW direction and at an estimated speed of 120 m.p.h. As it was leaving the area, the object took on a red glow and seemed to disappear.

7. It was been impossible to obtain the negative from the witness as he did not take any pictures and the camera he had with him did not have film in it.

8. In the opinion of the witness, the object was approx 60 feet in dia and had a white light which appeared to be on the top of the object. During the observation the object appeared to be rotating and had a luminous color and glow about it.

9. AFOSR does not consider this case closed, and if necessary will submit a request for another AF investigator to reinterview the witness and conduct a more thorough investigation.
