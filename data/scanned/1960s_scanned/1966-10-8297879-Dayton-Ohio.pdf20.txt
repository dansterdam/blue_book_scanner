There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
NO

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One):   Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound   NONE
b. Color   REDDISH-WHITE

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
THUMB WOULD COVER IT

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. 
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
