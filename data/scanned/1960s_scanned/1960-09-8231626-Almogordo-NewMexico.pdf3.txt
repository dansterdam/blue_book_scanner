FLYING OBJECS INVESTIGATION OFFICER. NO CONCLUSIONS ARE
DRAWN BY THE INVESTIGATION OFFICER AS TO THE NATURE OF THE UFO.
FOUR RELIABLE WITNESSES, ONE FROM EACH OF THE LOCATIONS MENTIONED

PAGE THREE PJJFBA 31
IN PARAGRAPH E ABOVE, WERE SELECTED AND QUESTIONED IN DETAIL PERSONALLY BY THE INVESTIGATION OFFICER ON THE EXACT SPOT THE OBSERVER WAS
STANDING AND AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME OF DAY THAT THE SIGHTING
OCCURRED. AN HOURS FOLLOWING THE DAY OF THE SIGHTING, THE OBSERVER
AT LAS CRUCES WAS THE ONLY OBSERVER THAT REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT
STOOD STILL OR HOVERED. IN THE OPINION OF THE INVESTIGATION
OFFICER, THIS CAN BE LOGICALLY EXPLAINED BY THE OPTICAL ILLUSION
CREATED BY THE RELATIVE MOTION OF THE UFO AND STATIONERY OBJECTS
