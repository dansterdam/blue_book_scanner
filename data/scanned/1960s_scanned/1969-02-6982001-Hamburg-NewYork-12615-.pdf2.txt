PRELIMINARY SUMMARY REPORT
Mr. Richard HEUTHER of Hamburg, New York, reported a UFO sighting to the US Air Force on 6 February 1969. The report stated that at around 6:00 PM on that date, Mr. HEUTHER observed a round, luminous white object in the sky over Hamburg, New York. The object appeared to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter and was observed for a period of about 2-3 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. Mr. HEUTHER was able to take a series of photographs of the object, two of which are included in this report.
