The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document containing instructions and diagrams related to sighting UFOs. The image does not contain any photographs, but rather diagrams and instructions for the reader.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the compass rose to show the direction in which the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass rose to show the compass direction where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, THEN HOW MANY WERE THERE? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
