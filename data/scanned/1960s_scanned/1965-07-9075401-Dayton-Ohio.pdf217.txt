The image contains an illustration, but no photograph. The illustration depicts an angular sky with lines and angles representing a sighting sketch or diagram, along with a compass rose. There is no text in the image itself, but the surrounding text appears to be instructions for the viewer.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the horizon (skyline) where you first saw the object. Show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "G" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "X" on the path, a "G" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
