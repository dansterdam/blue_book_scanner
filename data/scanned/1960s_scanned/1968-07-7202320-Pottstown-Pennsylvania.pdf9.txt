Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
U.S. Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

In reference to your request for more information concerning an unidentified flying object which I observed, I find that if my name in transmission from Benton Air Force Base to the project is changed, I might supply the persons address to whom I wrote and who might supply further information. 

My sighting, incidentally, was not reported to the Air Force for the purpose of investigation. I contacted the Air Force because various unidentified persons had contacted me about my alleged ability. My purpose in contacting him was not to make an official report, but to inform him that I did not believe that it was a conventional craft. I told him all the information that I previously observed. I told him all the information he might need about the persons I contacted and their crafts in different level zones. Private planes and higher and Air Force bombers, etc., at the same time in different zones did not seem unusual to me. 

Sec. 10 of a Mickey Mouse treatment. The Mercury received from the Aerial Phenomena Office a typewritten cover letter signed by Capt. Jesse Underwood. He enclosed a report written by Richard S. Schroeder who was in touch with Capt. Underwood at Benton and showed courtesy that even investigative ability. My purpose in contacting him was not to make an official report, but to inform him that I did not believe that it was a conventional craft. I told him all the information that I previously observed. I told him all the information he might need about the persons I contacted and their crafts in different level zones. Private planes and higher and Air Force bombers, etc., at the same time in different zones did not seem unusual to me.
