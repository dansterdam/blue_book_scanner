Flaming Object Lights Sky,
Startles Midstate Residents

A bright, moon-like object as a Central Pennsylvania resident called it, streaked across the sky Monday night startling residents of the Central Pennsylvania area. The weather bureau in nearby Harrisburg, Pa. was called but they said they had no knowledge of any special celestial events scheduled for the night.

Several residents reported seeing the object which was described as larger than a full moon and traveling at a high rate of speed. The object did not look like a satellite and several thought it might be a "lightning flash" or "falling star", but it was observed for some time and seemed to be within the Earth's atmosphere.

One Harrisburg resident, an Air Force man, said several other persons in his neighborhood also saw the object. He said it was a bluish-white color and seemed to be flaming as it went across the sky. 

Another resident said the object appeared to be slowly changing direction and would start and stop in its flight. It was described as larger than a full moon and seemed to linger for some time before going out of sight. 

The Harrisburg Police Department received several calls about the sighting and one officer said he had also observed the object from the City Hall in an effort to determine the source of the light.
