22 August 1966

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report

TO: Major Quintanilla (TDEW)
Virgin-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. As per our telephone conversation 19 August 1966, attached is letter received from xxxxxxxxxx concerning an "unusual airborne object."

2. I was unable to identify positively the lights he described. The weather at the time of the sighting was 10,000 feet scattered, 60 miles visibility, temperature 69, dew point 61, surface winds 130 degrees at 5 knots, distant lightning to the north and northwest.

3. The FAA Tower at the Albuquerque Airport does not have any information on any aircraft flying in the area. The Air Route Traffic Control Center advised that there was nothing on ultra high altitude over the area, however, they did have a report to an aircraft in the Albuquerque area at 25,000 feet from the local time indicated by xxxxxxxxxxx.

4. I interviewed xxxxxxxxxx. He is 48 years old, employed as a research manufacturer/photographer for Lockheed Precision Products. He has had photographic experience on various occasions, previously employed as a commercial pilot with 11,000 hours flying time, much of which was in Super Constellation and like aircraft for Pan American and other airlines. He expressed interest in the siting, but was not unduly disturbed by the sitting. Official enquiry was at 0132 Zulu, one hour for the observation.
