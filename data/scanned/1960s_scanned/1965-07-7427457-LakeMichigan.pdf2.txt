Dear Sirs:
I was wondering if there is any possible way you could explain what my friend and I saw on the evening of july the 15th of this year. We were fishing on the shore of Lake Michigan, and we noticed a strange light in the sky. We watched it for 15-20 minutes. At first it seemed to be a plane, but then it started maneuvering in such an erratic and fast manner. It would suddenly change direction and then hover, and then dart off in another direction. We have reported this because no one would believe us. What we saw was exactly as I have described. The speed and maneuverability of this thing was absolutely incredible. It appeared to be about 50 feet in size. This is not the first time I would say that I have seen objects like this. I would appreciate an acknowledgement of this letter.
Yours truly,
