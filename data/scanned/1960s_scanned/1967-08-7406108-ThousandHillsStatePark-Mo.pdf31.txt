UNITED AIR LINES

Major Quintanilla, Jr.
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office

Air Force Systems Command
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Major Quintanilla:

I am writing in reply to your letters of May 6th and May 7th.

In checking the VFON pilot report files I find no report for August 20th 1967 between the hours of 2200Z and 2300Z.

There is likewise no report for October 6th, 1967 anywhere near the Northern Great Circle of the U.S.A.

A continuous check of the March files still show no report for March 24th, 1968 between the hours of 0103Z to 0112Z.

I am very sorry that I have been unable to help you with any of the above requests. Please let me know if there is anything further that I might be able to help you with.

Sincerely Yours,

H. T. Roth, Project Director
Volunteer Flight Officer Network
