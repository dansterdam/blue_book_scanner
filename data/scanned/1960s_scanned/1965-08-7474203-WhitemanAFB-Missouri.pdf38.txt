AIR FORCE INVESTIGATORS CHECKING REPORT

County: Youth Snaps
Whether it was properly observed or not, the claim that a Pittsburgh youth has had quite an unusual experience with a flying object is now being thoroughly checked by Air Force investigators. Local residents of a Beaver County community, where the incident allegedly took place, are curious and some what bewildered by the whole affair. The youth is said to have reported seeing an object in the sky that had peculiar lighted effects and made maneuvers that were unexplained and out of the ordinary. There has been speculation and curiosity about the alleged incident in the area, but only the Air Force investigators will be able to solve the mystery.

JAMES LUCKI, Army, came here during his vacation time and interviewed the youth in question. He stated that a series of still photographs about 11:30 p.m. on August 7, 1965 show an unusual disc-like object in the sky, illuminated by intermittent flashing lights. The youth, according to Lucki, stated he was alone at the time and observed the UFO for about 10-15 minutes before it disappeared behind some trees. The boy claimed the object seemed to be about 500 feet in the air and about 200-300 yards away. It was shaped like a disc, and the flashing lights appeared to come from the underside of the craft, Lucki stated.
