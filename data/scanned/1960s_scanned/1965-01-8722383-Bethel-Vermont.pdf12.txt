DEACON OBSERVATORY 
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS

A REPORT ON THE BETHEL, VERMONT, SIGHTING OF 4 JANUARY 1956.

This case was investigated by Dr. J. Allen Hynek who visited Bethel, Vermont and interviewed several witnesses. After an essentially all day investigation, the conclusion of the interviewer is that, with a high degree of probability, the sighting was that of tracer bullets fired over the highway. These tracer bullets were observed indirectly according to the statements of the two Randolph men which seem to have the most weight, were that "the trail of tracer bullets is similar to the illumination of the Aluminum Battle of the American Flag at Bethel were lighted several times during World War II."

In addition to this comment, it is well-known that there are in the neighborhood who are given to playing pranks. It is relatively easy to obtain such tracer shells in the open market; and that there are no laws in Vermont prohibiting the use of such. It is quite understandable that even mature observers would be taken by surprise by such an unexpected and unusual phenomenon in view of the statements of the witnesses interviewed. It seems likely to the interviewer that the sighting was indeed the firing of tracer bullets across the highway.
