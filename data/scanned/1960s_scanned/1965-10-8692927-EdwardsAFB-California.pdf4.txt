EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE CALIFORNIA

On Tuesday, October 8, 1965, at 12:40 a.m. the commanding officer at Edwards Air Force Base, California received a call from an airman stationed at a remote location on the base concerning a strange light that he had observed in the sky. The airman stated that at approximately 12:30 a.m. he had observed a strange light in the sky that was moving in a northerly direction. He watched it for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared from view. The light was described as being very bright and about the size of a basketball. It was moving at a fairly rapid speed and appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet.

The commanding officer immediately dispatched two security policemen to investigate the sighting. Upon arriving at the remote location, the security policemen also observed the strange light in the sky. They watched it for several minutes before it suddenly disappeared from view.

The commanding officer then notified the Air Force Missile Development Center at Edwards of the sighting. The Air Force Missile Development Center stated that they had no missile or aircraft activities scheduled in the area at that time.

A thorough search of the area was conducted but no further evidence of the strange light was found. The incident was classified as an unidentified flying object.
