Dear Major Quintanilla:

Enjoyed our telephone conversations - have the indicated information on the case which we feel will be of interest. The investigation is involved and we feel certain conclusions can be made based on our thorough check of the facts.

I shall send you the Oklahoma Highway Patrol Log of what was reported and give most of the information but not all - for additional information I would suggest you check the files of the various news media in the Oklahoma City area.

I am inclosing to you a clipping from a recent mail from a our member giving data and observations. St. Petersburg July 27 on the same object.

We investigated a report of the OKLAHOMA CITY incident, it concerns a display of lights over the city, which the newspaper editor claimed would "send you to the YORK YOKE". I will send you the report. Should it be mailed this is the week-end as I plan to be from office.

Will keep you posted. Please let me know any thing you can do about getting the Oklahoma Highway Patrol and police observations. NOT the press.

It is my opinion that many of the sightings in 1965 were misidentified or hoaxed. HOWEVER NOTALL CAN BE EXPLAINED AWAY.

(Very truly yours,)
Heyden C. Hewes
Director, IUFO
