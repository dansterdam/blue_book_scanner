21 January 1963
SOLAN, OHIO Jan. 21, 1963 7:00-8:00 PM
SEVEN highschool astronomers(highschool) were out looking at Constallations(sic) through their telescopes, when the sky caught their attention. The air was extremely still, and they saw a bright yellowish object fly across the sky, caught in their attention. The object increased in speed and seemed to be rising in an accelerated way from them. This was discussed in connection with the UFO program.
