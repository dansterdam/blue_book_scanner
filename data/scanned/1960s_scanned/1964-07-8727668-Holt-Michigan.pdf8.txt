The image contains a diagram or sketch, but no photograph. The diagram appears to depict a UFO sighting, with instructions to draw the object's position and motion.

27. In the following sketch, imagine the object you saw in the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Please draw a "B" on the same curved line as where you saw the object when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "C" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
