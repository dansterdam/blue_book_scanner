The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather an empty circle. Therefore, I will not describe any photograph, since there is none present.

Performing OCR on the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   (NS)  Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   (NS)  Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Bright light about the size of a match head.
b. Color Bright blue white.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and tell how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The object is about 2' 6" in size.
The match head covered 90% of the bottom.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc. and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
