The image contains a photograph titled "LIGHT WING LOADING RE-ENTRY VEHICLE", which appears to depict a spacecraft or unidentified flying object.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
After it is opened, we let it roll again, and this changes the drag again. If we increase it by getting it beyond the interference of the balloon, the trailing string that you saw was the means of preventing it from getting all wound up. 
This is the Crew missile that this unit was put on. The Ballute is folded in a package between the missile and the booster. When this booster is fired after the booster is dropped off, this Ballute, about 30 feet in diameter, comes out and decelerates the bottom end of the vehicle. 
This was the first of two shots on that particular project.
As far as we can tell, everything was successful. We don't know what to change on the next one. This has been a very successful program.
The amount of sound we have to dampen, 10 times the amount of sound of a booster of this type, requires damping equipment, which gets very massive.
The other type of re-entry that we might want to discuss is what can you do about coming from outer space and flying down to a pre-determined landing space. It would have to be all packaged into the launch nose. When it gets up, into space, it would have to go to the vehicle that we are talking about.
