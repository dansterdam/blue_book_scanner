34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 19 March 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The reason I have not reported the phenomena to the F.B.I. or any other investigative agency is that I am an Air Force Instructor Pilot and I would not want to jeopardize my career or bring about embarrassment on the Air Force. There was an unidentified flying object observed on 15 March 1967 which exhibited movements and maneuvers that were not believed to be those of any known aircraft. This object was observed by two other witnesses as well as myself. We watched it for a period of approximately 30 minutes. Its movements were erratic, it accelerated rapidly, and maneuvered in a manner that could not be duplicated by any known aircraft. I am qualified to recognize and identify various types of aircraft and I am confident that this was not a conventional aircraft, either military or civilian. I am somewhat reluctant to report this incident for fear that I would be considered unstable or not a reliable witness. I do not wish to create the impression that I am given to fantasies or hallucinations. I am simply reporting what I and two other witnesses observed. This is the first and only incident of this nature that I have ever experienced. I do not wish to be considered a crackpot by my superiors or peers and I hope that you will treat this report in a confidential manner. I am employed in a sensitive position and cannot afford to have my reputation or career jeopardized.
