The report states that there had been considerable interest and public concern with a meteor/satellite burn out case. It also mentions an incident on 29 June 1966 in Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, but indicates that the report was not considered to be of sufficient significance to be included in the Project Blue Book files and was therefore ignored.
