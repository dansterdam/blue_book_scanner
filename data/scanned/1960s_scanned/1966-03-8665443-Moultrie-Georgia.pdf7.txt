There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten report or document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

Following is the text transcribed from the document:

Going course. And it seemed brilliantly visible until we got to the edge of town, where the buildings attracted our attention and we got to looking at them, I suggest where the object was. I asked them if they saw anything. But there were buildings on either side of them, and they seemed to think that may another and I were imagining things. If they had any intelligence whatever, they'd know that I imagined nothing at another time.

Well, you people might think that I'm all my rocker, but what I've written here is so true that I, and my mother, would submit it.
