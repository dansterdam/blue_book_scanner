Nature Note
Deadly Nightshade
"TROPICALLY-DISTILLED DRUGS, the so-called
deadly nightshade, are being grown wild in eastern
Minnesota. The Soudan-Ely family, it is
reported, is using this plant for its drugs, in
place of the commercial and Northern-grown
variety. The deadly nightshade was imported to this
country for utilization in medicine, as it contains
the deadly belladonna alkaloid, used in the dilating
of the pupils of the eye, and for nervous system,
intestinal cramps and as a pupil-dilating
eye drug.
According to reports, the plant is being grown by
the citizens of the town to utilize their pupils-in-order
to dilate their pupils, we are told, in a peculiar
racial fad in Ely. The entire nightshade
plant contains the deadly belladonna
alkaloid, fatal to humans and animals, and
should never be used by laymen
except under close medical supervision.
