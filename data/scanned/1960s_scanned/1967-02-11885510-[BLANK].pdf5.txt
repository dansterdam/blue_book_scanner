There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document discussing the persistence of terrestrial type life and the problem of contamination of planets by terrestrial micro-organisms. The text mentions experiments conducted in the East and West, particularly in the USSR, to test bacteria and other simple organisms under conditions found on the Moon, Venus, and Mars.

detail to show by energy considerations that life must necessarily
be based on hydrocarbon reactions.

Speculations common in the West about the possibility
of life based on ammonia, or even inorganic compounds (as in 
Hoyle's novel "The Black Cloud" which appears to be not only alive
but even intelligent) do not occur in Soviet literature.

3. Persistence of Terrestrial Type of Life

As conditions on the Moon, Venus, and Mars are known
to be severe in terrestrial terms, the problem arises whether
even the simplest terrestrial organisms like bacteria can exist
there. Experiments to test bacteria and other simple organisms
under these conditions are conducted in both the East and West,
on a comparable scale. In the USSR, this is done in the Institute
of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences, USSR, and probably other
places. There is a recent report of the simulation of conditions
on Mars for microbial growth by A. I. Zhukova and I. I. Kondrat'ev
(1965) of that institute.

The problem has assumed considerable importance as
terrestrial bacteria have been shown to possess remarkable
endurance and adaptability in planetary conditions. The danger
of contamination of planets by terrestrial micro-organisms exists
and has required international cooperation since the introduction
of space exploration.
