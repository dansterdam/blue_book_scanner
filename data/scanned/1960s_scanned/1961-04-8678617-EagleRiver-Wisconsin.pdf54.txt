Transcribing the text:

5. The man at the watch said he observed a white, circular object in the sky which appeared to move laterally at a rapid rate of speed. This object seemed to have a tail and was oscillating through the air. It disappeared from sight behind a wooded area. The witness reported that he stopped what he was doing, looked at the object steadily, and watched it until it disappeared. He states that he was quite sure this was not an aircraft or weather balloon.

6. The witness reported that the space craft was about 15 feet high and 50 feet in diameter. Approaching from the edge, when the hatch was closed its outline could not be seen.

7. It is the opinion of the Investigator that the... concerning this incident cannot be satisfactorily explained. Interviewers have reason to believe the witness is truthful and gives a statement without any tendency to exaggerate or sensationalize the story, which tends to indicate that this was a bona fide sighting.

8. The witness, a... engineer, is both Dr. Hynek and the ATIC radar expert's immediate superior. Hynek considers this case to represent one of the more significant reliable UFO sightings reported to Project Blue Book. Hynek recommended that this case be entered in the Master Sighting File under the category of "Unknowns" rather than "Insufficient Information." His recommendation was accepted.
