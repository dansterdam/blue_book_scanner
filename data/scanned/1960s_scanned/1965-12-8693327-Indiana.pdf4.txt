The image appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text indicates that a person named Major Quintanilla called someone named Mrs. [redacted] after seeing a flash while driving down the highway. It seems that Major Quintanilla took a picture, but only has the negatives at this time. The text mentions that the negatives show a "cloud of smoke" going in a certain direction, and Mrs. [redacted] said she would be glad to send the negatives or prints of the negatives.
