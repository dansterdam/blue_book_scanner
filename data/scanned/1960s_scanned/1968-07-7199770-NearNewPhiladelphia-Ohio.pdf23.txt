SUBJECT: UFO Sighting 1 July 1968

TO: DEPT (AFDO)

1. In response to your request, I have reviewed the data concerning the UFO sighting which occurred on 1 July 1968 near New Philadelphia, Ohio.

2. The atmospheric data presented with the report does not indicate the existence of any unusual weather conditions which could explain this sighting.

3. I noted a number of inconsistencies in the report. For example, one individual reported the movement of the object in an erratic direction, while another individual indicates the object was clear.

4. In one sketch of the location, the observer depicts an underground structure could have caused a projection such as reflected light. However, the sketch in this case indicates this was clearly not the case.

5. Two sequences in the report would appear to imply at least two or three observers (as called) UFO fans. By this I am referring to the "Messerschmitt" repeated comment that he would like to help you in your investigation, and this one indicates that "everyone thinks I am cracked."

6. In summary, as far as I am personally able to determine, it was, and still remains, a UFO.
