The image contains a sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch shows an angular object or objects in the sky and various angles or directions marked on the image. There are also instructions and questions printed on the page.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the line where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the line to show how far apart the azimuth compass directions were of the object's first and last positions.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the starting point of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. Then, if the same motion is seen again, draw the "B" and the "C" paths.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? About three. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
