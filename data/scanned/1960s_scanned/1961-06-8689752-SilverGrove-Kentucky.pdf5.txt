21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
22. We want to know the angular size. Hold a watch stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the width of the stick. If you had performed this observation, how much of the object would have been covered by the width of the stick held at arm's length?
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a complete account of the object or objects which you saw.
