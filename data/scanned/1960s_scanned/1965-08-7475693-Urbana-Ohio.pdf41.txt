Q. What did this object look like to you?
A. It looked more like a dim shared object to me.

Q. How large did the object appear to you?
A. About half as big as this room.

Q. About 3 feet in diameter?
A. Something like that.

Q. How long would you estimate the object was in sight?
A. Well, this is what you had the object in sight, what about this? It was in sight for a couple of minutes and then it went down in the air (north).

Q. Did you notice any features of the object, such as fins or windows or anything of that sort?
A. No, I didn't notice any fins or windows or anything of that sort. It didn't have any special features that I could see.

Q. Then, you were going in an opposite direction from the object and it was going away from you?
A. Yes, man I was scared and wanted to get out of there.

Q. Now, how would you sum up your story for a skeptic as to why you may possibly be telling the truth about this matter?
A. Well, I can't see any reason why I should tell anything but the truth about this matter. I did see something up there that I couldn't explain and I'm not going to try to pass it off as anything else. I saw it and that's a fact.

SUMMATION
Powell Ave. is located on the East side of the City of Urbana, and goes East and West. The object was seen about a 1/2 mile West of Powell Ave. and about 1/2 way up in the sky. The object was described as round, glowing white, and several times larger than a star. It was observed for several minutes and then made a sudden vertical ascent, at a high rate of speed, and disappeared. The deputy sheriff and a civilian observer both observed this object, and checked the Powell Ave. area. The results of this test were negative.
