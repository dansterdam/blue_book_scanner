The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. As instructed, I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document.

The text in the document reads:

"State is way foggy that form the DJ
to the south varies from 0 to 50 miles
On the sunny part of The picture the
fog clouds are 1/2 to 1 mile in thickness
The fog passes over the picture in a north
east direction. The domed object is made
small waves on the water surface when the
domed object would pass over the water 
surface near the water. The domed object
would rise and fall, left to right and
right to left across the sky in a north
east direction. The domed object was
not effected by the wind or weather being 
unstable domed object would remain
stable in flight as it moved across the sky."
