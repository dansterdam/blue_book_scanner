The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

Text from the document:

All of this is greately exaggerated. This looked to be some sort of reflection from the cars interior. The objects seemed to be of usual size and nature, and did seem to move in odd patterns, but this could have been caused by movement of the car, or reflections from the windows.

All of this is not true of this case. One of the chief reasons is that these would not show up on radar. Persons are not competent to judge the speed and distance and size of objects in the sky. Things usually appear much larger and faster than they actually are. The object could have been a satellite, a aircraft, or some other natural phenomenon which the witnesses misinterpreted.

The object did not do anything unusual, so I fail to see how this is of any real significance scientifically. Strange reports of this nature are very common and can usually be attributed to natural explanations after investigation. Therefore, I see no real evidence of anything extraordinary in this case.
