1. Subsequent to the telephone conversation with your office, the undersigned again contacted the 653rd Radar Squadron at Dauphin Island, Alabama. Additional information was obtained and there were two additional witnesses to this observation. The first was Airman Second Class Thurman, both of that squadron. They indicated to me that they were on their round-the-clock monitoring duties and observed the object in the sky. They indicated that it was red in color and stationary for a period of time, then ascended vertically and disappeared. 

2. The second was Airman Third Class Tiller, also of that squadron. He indicated to me that he too observed the object and it was red in color, stationary, then ascended vertically and disappeared. 

3. As indicated previously, the date of this observation was 15 February 1962.
