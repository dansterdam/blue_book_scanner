The image contains a technical diagram labeled "Diagram B" that illustrates a method for determining the height of a tubular object based on the observer's eye, the object's distance, and various geometric calculations. There is no photograph present in this image.

Graphic Solution for Determination of Height of Tubular Object

At a distance of 25 inches from observer's eye, the object
was estimated to be 1-1/4 inches in height.

A = Distance from observer's eye to ruler (hold at arm's
length)
B = Estimated height of object
C = Graphical slope distance from observer to object
D = Calculated (vertical) height of object (which is vertical position)

A ratio of A to B as C is to D gives a height of 70 feet.
