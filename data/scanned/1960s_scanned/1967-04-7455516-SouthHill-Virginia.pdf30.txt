The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, containing text describing an incident involving a gasoline fire on a road.

The text reads as follows:

road. The first test, using kerosene, failed because the kerosene could not be lit with a match. A piece of burning paper finally started a fire, after perhaps twenty seconds of burning, and then the fire progressed in a narrow strip across the object which was of solid, undetermined material, until it reached the first edge, where it went out. Total burning time was on the order of ten minutes.

A quart of gasoline was then spread over an area similar to the original, and set afire with a match. The first attempt to light it by dropping a burning match into the center failed, because there was not enough oxygen despite the bright visible flame. The second match was applied at the edge of the wetted area, which then burst instantly into flame. The flame burned at essentially a constant rate for about fifty seconds, and died out at sixty-eight seconds of elapsed time. A heavy black smoke was created, which formed a black semicircular area about a foot in extent on the pavement downwind from the burning patch a minute, but much lighter within, grew was to be seen two or three of the original patch, the downwind direction for the night of the sighting.

The effect of the gasoline fire on the road was far greater than what the original burn showed (although comparison was somewhat difficult due to the lapse of time and failure to keep traffic off the evidence). The gasoline fire melted a great amount of tar, which formed into pools. No pools at all are evident in the original. The flow of tar in the gasoline test resulted in disappearance of many stones under a coating of tar, yet all the stones in the original patch remained visible and were.
