The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

We feel reasonably sure the sightings were the result of some unknown type of vehicle, possibly interplanetary, landing in the clearing. 
In closing, we invite any persons having additional information on the Glassboro sighting to make their information available to us.
This report was compiled by the members of the UFO Investigations Team. 
We wish to thank Bernard Dusen, of NICAP and the NICAP news staff, Colonel Bouchard, USAF, becaute Jones, and the Glassboro Police for their valuable information and assistance.
