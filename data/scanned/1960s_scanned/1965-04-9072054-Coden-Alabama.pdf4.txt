The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

The three vehicle-like shape were not stationary but appeared to be moving northward very slowly.
We got a very clear look at them. But they were a strange shape rather than the type object that we normally see. 
I was more disturbing by strange shaped like rather then any actual object.
