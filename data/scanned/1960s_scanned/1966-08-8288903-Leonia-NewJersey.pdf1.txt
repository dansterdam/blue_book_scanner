11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched a star-like object travel across the sky. The object initially appeared as a single point of light. At the same time in another part of the sky two additional objects appeared which seemed to join with the first object, this lasted about 15 minutes before disappearing. The description is consistent with that of an aerial phenomenon.
