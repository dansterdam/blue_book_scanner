Dear Major Burner
First, I would like to apologize for the delay in getting this report to you. I have been ill for the last two weeks and just got back to work today.

As I explained to you on the phone, this is an unusual sighting that I am not quite sure how to interpret. I have never seen anything like it before.

At approximately 2:30 am on July 10th, I was called by the Omaha Police Department to investigate a report of a strange object in the sky. When I arrived at the location, I observed a large, brightly lit object hovering silently approximately 500 feet above the ground. It appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a pulsing, multicolored light. 

The object remained stationary for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight at an incredible speed. I have no explanation for what I witnessed. I can only describe it as unlike any conventional aircraft I have ever seen.

I hope this report is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
