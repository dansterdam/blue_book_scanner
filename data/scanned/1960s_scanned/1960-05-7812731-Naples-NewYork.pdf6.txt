Dear Sir:

On Thursday 26 May, while sitting at my picture window at our home in Naples, a very strange thing happened. It was about something like five minutes or there about. 

I noticed about something like a fish-bowl-like a sphere, except that it had a glassy appearance. It came towards our home coming from the west with a sudden motion. Beneath this sphere, there appeared some small disturbances and slight glitterings in the air near the surface of the sphere. This sort of apparition startled me, and I found my field of vision narrowed, as if I looked in vain for the sphere. None was to be further en, perhaps they would not be visible anyway, as they were moving toward the sun.

Soon, a small glow seemed to be moving to my neighborhood (or perhaps its own neighborhood), as a beacon. Within a few moments, the small plane having passed, these glowing things, which I would liken to an orange in size, seemed to dart out of the sky. The wind appeared two sort of flat, shiny things, which dropped into the vine and moved away rapidly in an easterly direction. It was all over in what seemed less than a minute.

I'm really quite disturbed about this. I wonder if there could be any explanation which would enable us all to be on guard on behalf of our country. This I have no other recourse but to report to you the incident, as I witnessed it myself. I have no doubt as to the reality of what I saw. I would be grateful if you could give me any information on this subject.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
