TO: TD-X (Col FPtand)
The following, extract from an Air Force letter, has Edward's OD Report dated 17 Sep 62, 
a source for your information:

The UFO situation which took place on 29 Aug 62 at approximately 1930 hours was reported and observed by a number of people. Initial sightings had given a better description of the UAO as it left the scene at a very high rate of speed. The approximate dimensions were 30 - 40 ft in diameter and approximately 15 - 20 ft thick. The color was a bright orange to reddish orange and was flying at a low level.

As it attained a higher altitude, it appeared to split into four smaller objects, still maintaining their original Course, speed and altitude. The individual objects were quite bright and appeared to be emitting an orange light. This formation was observed for approximately 5 minutes, after which time they disappeared from sight, one by one, as they reached their maximum altitude. No sound was heard.

The report was made by Captain J. X. Hill, 47th Air Division, 512th Tactical Control Group. Lookbourne AFB, Ohio.

This action was witnessed by several airmen and informed observers.

The second report was from Lockerbone APS SAC Command Post:

Lead Aircraft - Captain J. X. Hill, 47541, 512th 
Aircraft 22 - Captain J. L. Lownds, 15766, 313th
Crew 32a3, Lockerbone AFB

Briefing: SAC pilots and airborne observers saw "unusual shaped clouds" in a level position like a "super con trail" with all maneuvers very "quick and precise". The sighting lasted approximately 5 minutes. The objects were observed to be very bright, clear, moonlite night, visibility unlimited.
