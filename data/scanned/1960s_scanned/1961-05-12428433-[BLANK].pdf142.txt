The image shows a human centrifuge at the U.S. Navy AMAL facility in Johnsville, Pennsylvania. The centrifuge appears to be a large, mechanical device with a chair-like structure mounted on an arm that can rotate rapidly to simulate high-g forces. A person is seated in the centrifuge, likely undergoing testing or training related to Project Mercury, the United States' first human spaceflight program.
