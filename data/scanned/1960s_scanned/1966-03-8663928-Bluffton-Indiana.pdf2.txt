The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten letter describing the observer's sighting of a UFO (unidentified flying object) in the early morning hours. The key details described are:

- The observer saw a U.F.O. going around the moon
- It had a red top and a silvery/colored bottom, with green flashing lights
- The object then disappeared

The letter is signed by the observer, whose name is redacted.

Dear Sir,
One night I saw at 4 in the morning a U.F.O. going around the moon. It had a red top and a silvery colored bottom. With green flashing lights meant they were dashing. It had disappeared. 
Thank you for reading my letter.
Sincerely,
(Redacted)
