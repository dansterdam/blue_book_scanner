Dear Col.Quintanilla:
Very many thanks for the "translation on Chinese Meteor Showers"
which have just come and necessarily looked over. It do not have it and am most happy to
receive it. It is very interesting.
Incidentally, it is too bad that their so-called government is so hostile to us,as I do not think old enough to remember how many times AGC and was the best friend China had and gave them back all this money they paid for damages.
I have a path worked out for the March 25/ object on which you sent me a letter. This is workable reports that take care of April 6 and 13 and they are satellites. It was a meteor or reentry as satellite was at 3:20.5 east, if you have a century listed for data, please let me know as it seems listed for early date.
O.S.I. over general region long-lag L.W int. 55W. Three reports came in from planes, sent by NORAD to Denver. Do you by chance have any reports of on their ?50 they would be most gratefully received.
Again thanking you for the Chinese Translation,
Most sincerely yours,
