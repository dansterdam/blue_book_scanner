The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a questionnaire or document, with two questions printed on it:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: _ Day _ Month _ Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questionnaire or a narrative description of your sighting.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: _ Day _ Month _ Year
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questionnaire or a narrative description of your sighting.
