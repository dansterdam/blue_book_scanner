The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter on official Air Force letterhead, addressed to "Mr. Gus Richard", from "WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR., MAJOR, USAF, 1424 Information Projects Officer, Public Information Division, Office of Information".

The text of the letter is as follows:

7 November 1961

Dear Mr. Richard:

Your recent letter to the Office of Aerial Phenomena has been reviewed by this office for a reply.

In your letter you make several observations that require some comment. Your sighting is not possible due to the general and well-known characteristics of balloon flights and ground illuminations. The objects could have been either balloons or ordinary aircraft, reflecting sunlight or being illuminated by searchlights at night. In many instances these are reported as "objects" rather than identified with certainty.

Since your sighting occurred approximately two months ago and you did not report it to the Air Force at the time, it is not practicable for us to attempt any further investigation. If you complete them and forward to us, the better chance we will have in reaching a conclusion.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
MAJOR, USAP
1424 Information Projects Officer
