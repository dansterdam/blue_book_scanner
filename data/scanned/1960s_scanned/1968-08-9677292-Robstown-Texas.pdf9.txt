DESCRIBING:

2 orange round lights, white center, object not very bright, but lit up whole area, made no noise, about 2 miles away, went above trees, hovered a few minutes, then took off fast & straight up, total sighting time about 10 minutes.

I grabbed my wife & asked if she saw what I did. She said yes, she saw it too. We were outside cleaning up yard when we first saw it. The object appeared to be about 2 miles away, over the next field. It hovered at about 500 ft. altitude for a few minutes, then took off straight up at a terrific speed. There was no sound whatsoever. After it disappeared, the night seemed unusually dark compared to before. I can describe the object in detail but could not draw it accurately. The whole experience was very upsetting and I wish I knew what it was.
