The image contains a photograph that appears to be a hand-drawn diagram or sketch. The diagram shows a cross-sectional view of an object or structure, with labels indicating the "East", "Top", "South", "Bottom", and "West" orientations. There is also a question mark next to the word "Direction?", suggesting uncertainty or inquiry about the orientation or movement of the object depicted.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), so this diagram may be related to the documentation of a UFO sighting or observation.
