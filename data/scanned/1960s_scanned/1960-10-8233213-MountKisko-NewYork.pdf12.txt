The image does not contain a photograph or any other visual element besides the text on the page. As requested, I will act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and produce the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects under. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
A LITTLE LARGER THAN SOMETHING THE SIZE OF THE END OF A PENCIL

22. We wish to know the speed at which the object was moving. Hold a match stick or some object of known length in line with the object. At the same time note how long the object would have been covered by the length of the match. If you had differed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match?
WOULD ONLY FILL 1/2 OF LENGTH

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
YES : JUST SEEMED TO FADE AWAY, HARD TO EXPLAIN DID NOT GO TO THE HORIZON OR ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
APPEARS AS A CIRCULAR, BRIGHT LIGHT
