Great wide strange looking object 1000 ft up. Very fast about 10 sec. Just went out of sight. Strange glow went out. Lights on it very strange. I did not tell any body about it or report it. I would not know how to report it or what good it might do. I have no way of knowing if some one else saw it. I gave a vivid description to my wife who was with me. I thought it might be a helicopter but it was too large and fast. I thought it might be a plane but it was not flying like any plane I ever saw. I just don't know what it was."
