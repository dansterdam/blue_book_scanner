The Langenhoe Incident
By Dr. Bernard E. Finch

On September 4, 1965, a very interesting sighting occurred near Langenhoe, a small town in Essex, England. This incident was witnessed by an intelligent engineer by the name of Paul Green, and it is his eyewitness account that follows.

Approximately 8:35 P.M. on the evening of September 4, 1965, I drove home from a business trip. As I approached a country road near Langenhoe, I saw a bright clear light in the sky that appeared to be coming down rapidly towards me. The light was pacing my car and kept altering its direction from over Langenhoe and then towards me. 

As I approached the straight road south to Langenhoe, I slowed down and watched this approaching bright light. It seemed to hover over the road, then suddenly darted down and appeared to come to rest on the ground approximately a quarter of a mile ahead. I drove on slowly, as I wanted to get a closer look at this phenomenon.

As I got nearer it appeared to be a large oval object, silver in color, about sixty to eighty feet in diameter. A beam of light was shining down from the underside of the object illuminating the ground below. The object was rotating slowly, almost imperceptibly, whilst the beam of light seemed to scan the area it was illuminating.

Suddenly the light went out, and the object shot straight up into the sky disappearing in a flash. I continued on, but could see no trace of where it had landed. The whole incident lasted approximately five minutes. Later I reported the incident to the police.
