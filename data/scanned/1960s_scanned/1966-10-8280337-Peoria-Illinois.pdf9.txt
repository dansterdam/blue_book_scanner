This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is a narrative response to a questionnaire, describing the witness's experience of seeing something in the night sky after returning to their house.

The text reads:

I feel positive about seeing some form of UFO. After walking into my house and depositing packages I was carrying I hurried back outside to see if there might be some such thing that I had observed. I did not tell anybody else what I had seen, as I just was so awed I had to take another look to prove to myself that I actually had seen something in the night sky.
