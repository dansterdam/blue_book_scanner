The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text output from the document:

(1) The material, using a precision 1116 scintillator, appeared to be a circular disc of vegetation, the size of which could not be determined. The basic shape was a solid circle, about 8 1/2 to 9 inches in diameter. The current readings ranged from 0.004 to 0.010 mr/hr.
(2) According to the Investigator of Project Blue Book, Appleton, Wisconsin indicates that "the tissue-like part" is composed of a fibrous-like material, and that the country and nature of the material could not be definitely determined or identified. Microscopic examination of the material indicates that the tissue-like part was made both in this case and in previous cases by hand cutting, hand tearing and hand shaping of the material. There is no evidence to indicate that the tissue-like part did not come from the actual plant or vegetation from which it appears to have been obtained.
(3) A decipherment of the shorter message, allegedly dropped by the robot, indicates that this work is done by a human, either at the place of the landing or elsewhere. Since the message contains no diagrams, drawings or sketches, the text of the message is quite apparent, however, we have made no attempt to date the material (1956) of the message or to determine the validity of such.
SUMMARY: The Air Force cannot substantiate the reported sighting and alleged landing on the basis of factual or measurable evidence.
