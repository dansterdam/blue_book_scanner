The image contains two sketches or diagrams. The larger sketch is a compass rose, with the cardinal directions and intermediate directions labeled. The smaller sketches appear to be schematics or illustrations depicting how to indicate the direction of a phenomenon witnessed, as described in the text above the diagrams.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A + ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. IF THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LANDING SKETCH.
