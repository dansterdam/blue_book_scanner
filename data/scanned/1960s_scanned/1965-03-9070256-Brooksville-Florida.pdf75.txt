REPORT DESCRIPTION
The object appears at first glance to be a fairly long range, silvery, disc-shaped object moving slowly through the sky. On closer examination, however, the object seems to be a distant aircraft, possibly a jet, reflecting the sunlight and silhouetted against the sky.

The observer first saw the object while outside observing the weather and sky. It was moving from north to south at a fairly high altitude and at a moderate speed. The object appeared metallic and disc-shaped, catching the observer's eye due to the glare of sunlight reflecting off its surface. As the observer watched, the object continued on its course, finally disappearing from view.

This appears to be a fairly routine sighting of a distant aircraft, possibly a jet, that was mistaken for a silvery, disc-shaped UFO due to the sunlight reflecting off its surface. No unusual characteristics or maneuvers were reported, and the object was likely a conventional aircraft rather than an unknown aerial phenomenon.
