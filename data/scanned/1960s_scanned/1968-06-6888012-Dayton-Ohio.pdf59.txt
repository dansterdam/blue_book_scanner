Damage observed in the micrographic analysis to indicate that the metallic material is best described as "high-manganese austenitic stainl. This is consistent with the very weak ferromagnetic nature of the metal.

The iron oxide and the hydrated iron oxides on the surface are normal results of the exposure of steel to the atmosphere. The amounts of quartz and calcite detected by X-ray diffraction are very small, and are common extraneous materials.

The analyses indicate that the object contains no minerals or materials not normally constituent with common high-tensile steels. The object is therefore considered to be of terrestrial origin.
