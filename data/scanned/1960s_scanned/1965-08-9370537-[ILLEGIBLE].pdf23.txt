Dear Major Quintanilla:

This letter is to follow up on our telephone conversation of August 31, 1965, regarding photographs taken by UFO enthusiasts.

As I understand it, you asked for information on how to handle such requests. In this particular case, we have received a letter from a customer asking about the status of his request for copies of photographs he claims were taken of a UFO.

Let me assure you that we take great care in handling all such requests for photographic evidence. Our policy is to neither confirm nor deny the existence of any photographs until their authenticity has been fully established.

In this instance, I am advised that our photographic experts are currently examining the material submitted. As soon as their analysis is complete, we will be in touch with the customer to advise him of our findings.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,

R. G. Du Welde
Representative, Photographic Division
