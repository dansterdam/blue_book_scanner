Dear Miss [REDACTED],

Thank you for your recent inquiry on information related to Unidentified Flying Objects. 

Neither the Kennedy Space Center nor any other agency of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is responsible for scientific or technical aspects concerning UFOs. This is a mission of the U.S. Air Force. I suggest you direct your inquiry to:

Air Force Systems Command (AFSC)
Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland

Sincerely yours,

[SIGNATURE REDACTED]
Paul C. Donnelson, Chief
Education & Community Service

Commanding Officer
Andrews AFB
Maryland

Dear Sir:

Please do not push off us citizens who see these unusual objects in the sky as "spot-lights" seekers bent on publicity. This is the second time I've seen an object moving at tremendous speed to waste. Only this one was most unusual.

Since I revealed this reply from NASA, I spent some time in a hospital film delayed in returning it to you.

Sincerely yours,
[SIGNATURE REDACTED]
