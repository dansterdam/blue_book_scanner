the sun was not shining on it and it looked dark and it was cigar shaped.
With regard to the size of the object what would you compare that to at that distance? I*d have no--oh, you mean at that distance? I see what you mean. Oh, I would say oh what would I compare it with? The size of a baseball.
And with regard to color, you said when the sun was out it was rather dark.
It was just dark, yes. And when the sun was shining on it, it looked like it reflected silver or aluminum.
When the sun was on it,did it have a shimmering effect like it was vibrating? No, it didn't, it was--edges were clear.
It was a steady color then? Yes.
Did you notice any distinguishing features like you see on manned aircraft with an exhaust or vapor trail? No, none.
Did it have any protruding points like a tail section or wing? Not that I could see.
At that time there was no sound? No sound.
What would you estimate the distance as? I*d have no idea. It was about the size of a baseball and I couldn*t tell the distance.
Could you estimate the altitude or the angle from the ground? No, I couldn*t.
During the time that you watched it, was there any specific flight pattern? Does it move in any direction? While I was watching it through the binoculars it was just suspended in the air. There was no movement, up, down, or sideways. It seemed to remain stationary.
You think at this time the disc was rotating? /
