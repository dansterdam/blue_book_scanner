The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a handwritten document or report.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

Came out to a spot on the hill or road, and saw the obj ect over house, on Walcott Rd, some 20-30 seconds, no more. Not a star or plane, definite object,. Triangular in shape, Reddish Orange in color,. Seemed to have a dull gleam, no obvious lights, just the color glowing. Seemed to be moving quite rapidly at first, then slowed down and hovered, then it disappeared, just a vanishing, no trail, no sound. Witness sure it was not a star, air craft, or anything like that. Strange obj ect, not known to him. Called BLUE BOOK right away.
