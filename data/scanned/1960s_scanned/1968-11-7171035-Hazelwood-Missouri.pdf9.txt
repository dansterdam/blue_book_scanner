The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE, PHENOMENON, HOW MANY WERE THERE? DRAW A PICTURE TO SHOW HOW THEY WERE ARRANGED. DID THIS ARRANGEMENT CHANGE DURING THE SIGHTING?

A DAY SKY TWILIGHT
TWILIGHT NIMBUS CLOUDS (HICH FEEY OR HERRING-BONE)
NIGHT CLEAR
DUSK PARTLY CLOUDY
COMPLETELY OVERCAST CUMULUS CLOUDS (RAINY)
CIRRUS CLOUDS (WISPY) 
HAZE OR SMOG NONE

(1) IF THE SIGHTING WAS AT TWILIGHT OR NIGHT, WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE STARS AND MOON?

NONE BRIGHT MOONLIGHT
A FEW MOON WITH HALO
MANY MOON HIDDEN BY CLOUDS
UNKNOWN

D. IF SIGHTING WAS IN DAYLIGHT, WAS THE SUN VISIBLE?
YES NO. IF "YES," WHERE WAS THE SUN AS YOU FACED:

IN FRONT OF YOU TO YOUR RIGHT OVERHEAD (NEAR ZENITH) UNKNOWN

E. SPECIFY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS OR STREET LIGHTS. BRIEFLY EXPLAIN ITS LOCATION, INTENSITY OR LIGHT SOURCE.

13. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT SEEMED TO BE LUMINOUS AND WHAT COLORS YOU NOTICED. DESCRIBE YOUR IMPRESSION OF WHETHER IT WAS SOLID, VAPOR-LIKE, OR APPEARED TO BE METALLIC. DESCRIBE ANY CHANGES IN FORM, BRIGHTNESS, OR MOTION YOU NOTICED.

Just a light appearing over the hills, size of the full moon. The light seemed to dim and get brighter at times and move a little. The light moved up and down and sway from side to side. It did not seem to be very high and was some distance away.
