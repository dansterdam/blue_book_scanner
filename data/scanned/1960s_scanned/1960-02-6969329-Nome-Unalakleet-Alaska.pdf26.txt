HEADQUARTERS 
ALASKAN COMMAND 
APO 942, Seattle, Washington 
OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF INFORMATION

REPLY TO 
ATTN OF:

19 February 1960

SUBJECT:

TO: Mr. Orville H. Spilltt
Director, Office of News Services 
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (PA) 
Department of Defense
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Spilltt:

Attached for your information are copies of news items concerning civilian reports of unidentified flying objects seen over Nome, Unalakleet and other nearby points in Alaska. These civilian reports of a flying object passed in a southeasterly direction were reported to NORAD exactly as received by Alaskan Command. In the process it seems the story was splintered into two separate missile-firing incidents in north-south bound directions, supposedly indicating the conclusion drawn that there were two objects. There is considerable confusion in the minds of those who witnessed the phenomenon and there is certainly no count that many people saw something, but it was not registered on any tracking facilities in this area. There is currently no other information concerning this incident.

Sincerely,
//s// Carlos G. Smith
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief of Information
