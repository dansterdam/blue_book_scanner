The image appears to contain a hand-drawn diagram and some text. The diagram shows a horizon line with some angled lines and a compass rose or similar circular symbol. The text below the image asks the reader to imagine the sighting and provide information about how high the object was above the horizon and the direction it was moving.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. First give the estimated height of the object above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Please put this figure in the box.

20. Give the direction of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
