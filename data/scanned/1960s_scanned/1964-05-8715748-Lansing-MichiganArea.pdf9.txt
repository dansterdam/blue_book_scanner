Whining Object in Sky Mystifies Lansing Area

LANSING - An unidentified flying object buzzing a suburban area near the East Lansing General Motors plant Wednesday night has the Lansing police puzzled.

The object, described as "a great, howling cone, spinning and a light-colored, shiny, metallic thing," was spotted by several observers, including a television newsman who saw it hovering for a while over the Lansing plant.

Stanley Rager, 60, and his wife, Blanche, were on their way home from the Lansing restaurant he owns.

"They first saw the object," Rager said, "as we were driving east on Interstate 496 near the General Motors Fisher Body plant. It looked like a great, huge bowl, spinning very rapidly, and it was sending out a whirring noise that sounded very high-pitched."

Elmer Spear, of 1008 W. Dunlap, Lansing, said, "I don't know sounds carried that far." He said the sound was a "whirling noise that started low and got so loud and high-pitched it seared me."

Army Capt. Donald Kearney, a graduate student at Michigan State University, said, "I thought it was a helicopter (or) tanks on Cedar St. But it was like nothing I've ever seen before."

One unidentified woman said she saw the UFO is then take off again."
