The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed letter on an official Air Force letterhead.

February 18, 1967

You may be interested in seeing the photograph which I took of the object I saw. As I said, "reproduced" is the object. It was 20 - 30 feet long and about 5 feet thick, and was in a stationary position northwest of Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania and moved off towards the southeast.

Yours truly,

O.C., to
Langlie Air Force Base
