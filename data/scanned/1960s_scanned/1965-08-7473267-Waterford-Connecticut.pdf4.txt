When I looked at the moon and this evening the moon was the clearest that I have ever seen it, the sky was clear with a few clouds but I could see the xxxxx surface or rather what is seen by the naked eye which I say this I just looked out my bedroom windowsxx and while the moon looks xxxxxxxx I farther away I can still see this xxxxx object crossing the moon's surface. It is probably nothing but I just thought that you might be interested in hearing about it.

Thank you for your time in reading this letter.

Sincerely yours,
