Dear Sir,

As approximately 2025 Q on 10 Aug 1968 I saw a phenomenon in the sky which I feel I should report to you. When I went out of my house at around 6 a.m. a bright-green band of light in the sky that I at first thought was the aurora borealis - I realize it is a northern horizon specially. It was from the horizon over Rio old Esterville to a great 60' above and over my house it question the US hoard Station Roosevelt Field PD. I then notice a bright yellow-white light, with an elliptical halo round it, slightly above the mountain and in the land of livesgreen light.

I called to my wife, as I thought maybe I was seeing my first flying saucer, and when I did so it disappeared. So it would not be of the subject, and last it.
