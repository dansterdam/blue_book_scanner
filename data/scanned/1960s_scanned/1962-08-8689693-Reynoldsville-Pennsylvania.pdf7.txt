Dear sirs,
Trying to make a report.

On August 11, 1962 on a Saturday night, I saw an object on the road in front of my house. When I got closer to look at it, the object left the road and started going over the house, and went out of sight.
It was about 10-15 feet in diameter, saucer shaped, with a ring of flashing lights around the edge. It made no noise. 
The whole thing lasted about 15 minutes.

Respectfully,
[Signature]
