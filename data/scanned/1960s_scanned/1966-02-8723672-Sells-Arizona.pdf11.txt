Gentlemen:

Enclosed is a duplicate of a photograph I took about a year ago. This was taken with my camera on March 30, 1967, at about 11:30 P.M. I was standing on an east-southeast 100 daylight film at about 1/125th second at approximately F/8, and it shows an object over the town of Gila Bend, Arizona, toward the northeast of Casa del Grande Mountain going southwest toward Phoenix, which is the mass of light in the center.

When the object is projected on a forty-by-forty-inch screen, there appears to be a twenty-inch screen. There is apparently emitting a sort of blue glow. Though there are some objects near on the film, they are not one of them, and it was a cloudy night, so no stars are visible. I do not believe the object reflects camera or film because it seems too bright and distinct. However, I do believe it is a genuine UFO.

I did not see the object in the sky at the time, perhaps because I was concentrating on the camera and I knew nothing of it until the film was processed. I took a few other photographs that night, but this is the only one that shows anything out of the ordinary. It has a series of different exposure times for experimental purposes and should be examined.

I would appreciate any comment or explanation you may have on this photo.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
