August 3rd, 1965

Dear Sir,

I hear you may think I'm just a 23 year old boy, but I'm not. I am very interested in the UFO investigations. Maybe I don't know as much as some of the scientists that have studied them, but I've taken a special interest about the UFOs.

On the night of May 9, 1965 a friend of mine and I saw a very peculiar thing. It was a beam of orange light that came down across the sky and disappeared. My friend's house has a clearing in the woods where we could see the sky clearly. We both saw the same thing at the same time. I asked him what he thought it was and he said he didn't know but it sure was strange. We both agreed that we had never seen anything like it before. 

The next day, when the object was moving with the light to light up, my friend and I went to look but we couldn't see anything definite.

I was wondering if you could tell me or suggest what I might have seen. There were no sounds at all and the light was very brilliant. The light seemed to come down and then go back up into the sky. We both guessed that it was some type of unusual aircraft but we're not sure.

I would appreciate any information you can give me on this subject.
