THIS INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

This object may be known but since officials in the White House, Defense Building, give no explanation, perhaps the Air Force does not know what it is.

This object was first seen in the latter part of November. This object looks like a star and shines like a star. During this sighting of the object, it would sometimes give a slight flash. It was first observed the last of the day and continue on its journey. It first appeared to the northwest and would travel across the sky but still traveling from East to West. Every night when it would travel about 15 degrees as shown in the questionnaire. It would take about 3 minutes to travel across the sky.

Then when it appeared again in the later part of February, it was traveling from West to East. This time it would come out on the North side. We only saw it this time for about 4 nights because the nights were getting warmer.

If it does appear again, I would think it will come around the last part of May from what I have estimated. I estimated this from the first two sightings.

If some of the questions in the questionnaire are wrongly answered, it is because in this business you sometimes are unable to answer because they refer to an object seen only once and I saw this one several nights.
