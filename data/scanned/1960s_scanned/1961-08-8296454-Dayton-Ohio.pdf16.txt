The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which seems to be a questionnaire or form asking the observer to describe their sighting of a UFO or unidentified object.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
No - it just went straight out slow at a low level.
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a summary of the object or objects which you saw, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The text appears to be a digitized version of the handwritten responses to the questionnaire. The observer seems to describe the UFO as moving straight out slowly at a low level, but it does not disappear while they were watching it.
