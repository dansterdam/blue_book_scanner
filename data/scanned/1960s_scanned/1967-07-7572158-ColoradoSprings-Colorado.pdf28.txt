The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed questionnaire form from the U.S. Air Force regarding a UFO sighting. The form appears to be from 1967 and is titled "Official U.S. Air Force".

Here is the text I was able to extract from the document:

WE DID JULY 67
SAYING THAT I ACTUALLY SAW A FLYING SAUCER.
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN BY OTHERS BUT I AM REPORTING THIS BECAUSE I AM INTERESTED IN U.F.O.'S.
