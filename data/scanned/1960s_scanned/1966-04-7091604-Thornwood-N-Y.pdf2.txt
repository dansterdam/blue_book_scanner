Dear Dan, can you see me now? 
April 26, 1966
To whom it may concern:
On the night of April 25, 1966 at 9:35 PM, I noticed an object in the sky, which at first to my eyes it was something that I have never seen before.
My description of it:
1. It passed bright over my head at a very high altitude.
2. It moved silently and had a strange old (red?) color.
