UPOS OVER CUYAHOGA FALLS
July 9, 1954 - 11:30 P.M. (approximately)
A large white object, which appeared to be hovering, was first observed shortly after 11:30 P.M. This object took a hovering position and remained stationary for some time. It then began to move slowly to the north.
Mr. King then noticed that 2 or 3 smaller objects were dimming the stars in their immediate vicinity. These smaller objects were observed for about 5 minutes, during which time they maintained a horizontal line formation and appeared to be under intelligent control. 
The 2 smaller objects in horizontal line formation proceeded upward at high speed, remaining in this formation. The 3rd object then made a sudden vertical rise and joined the other 2. This 3 star triangular formation stayed in this position for a short time, then the 3 objects suddenly and completely disappeared.
Bright white lights, approached from the 5 S.E., were then observed moving rapidly in a zig-zag pattern across the sky. This object suddenly disappeared, only to reappear approximately 1/2 hour later. It diminished in size and intensity until it was no longer visible.
All aspects of this sighting have not been communicated to all 7 observers. However, United States Air Force investigators L.J. Blurick and Lt. William L. Baer were dispatched to interview the witnesses and obtain complete details.
