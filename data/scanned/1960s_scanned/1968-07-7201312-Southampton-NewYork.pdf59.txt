REPORT OF SIGHTING OF STRANGE MOVING OBJECT ON 29 JULY 19_  
TIME: Sighted at approximately 2:50 PM CDT - 2 minutes  
LOCATION OF OBSERVER: Laredo, Texas, 270 30' N., 990 30' W.  
SKY CONDITION: Clear  
SEEING CONDITION: To the south, limiting magnitude about 4 to 4.5. To the north, somewhat hazy, limiting magnitude about 3 to 3.5.  
DESCRIPTION: The object was about 1 hour after passing the zenith, moving in a straight line from the west to east, with a speed that would have covered the full visible sky in about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. It was about the apparent size of a dime held at arm's length. It seemed quite bright, much brighter than any star or planet, and left no trail. It was seen on these occasions and showed no change in appearance except that on one occasion it seemed slightly elongated. As it passed to the east, it gradually faded from view. This was an unusual object, a description of which follows:  

APPEARANCE: It appeared to be a seamless egg-shaped or elliptical form, with a smooth, uniform surface and no visible markings or projections. In color, it was much the same as the light seen in a small incandescent lamp. It seemed to emit an internal glow rather than reflect light from the sun.  

MOTION: It was in motion when I first sighted it, at the point where it was at its highest altitude. Its speed was steady and the motion was even and smooth, without any wavering or irregular flight path. I lost sight of it as it faded in the distance to the east.  

FURTHER NOTES ON GENERAL APPEARANCE: To the naked eye, it had the appearance of a star-like object, but with a slightly larger visual magnitude than that of the brightest stars. When my gaze was fixed on it, it appeared to have a slightly elongated shape. When my gaze was diverted, it seemed to return to a more circular appearance. No sound was heard. No vapor trail or exhaust was visible, and there was no evidence of any propulsive mechanism. The object appeared to be self-luminous, giving the impression of a miniature sun or nuclear device.
