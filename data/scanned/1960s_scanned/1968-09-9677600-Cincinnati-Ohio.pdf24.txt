The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document that includes a question and a handwritten response.

The text in the document is:

AFR 80-17(C)

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAD HELD THE MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH, HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT WOULD THE HEAD OF THE MATCH HAVE COVERED? ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE TOTAL OBJECT WAS COVERED.

It appears that someone has handwritten a response in the space provided, which reads:

D   STANCES at ABOUT 5 OBJECTS AT YHE DISTANCE 
BETWWWN TWO 3 OBJECTS.  AT TIMES IT IS 4 TIMES 
AS LARGE AN OBJECT.
