About Object
GROVELAND - Six local 
youths were interviewed Satur-
day night by a representative of 
the NICAP (National Investiga-
tion Committee on Aerial Phe-
nomena), concerning a sight-
ed flying object reported seen
last Thursday night.
Raymod E. Fowler, Weston, 
chairman of the National Inves-
tigation Committee on Aerial 
Phenomena of Massachusetts, in-
terviewed the youths at the same
time as the boys. Fowler said only
about 10 per cent of the persons
reporting such 
phenomena report the incident. He stressed
persons having in 
formation are afraid 
of bein ridiculed in making their reports,
for their names are kept 
confidential if they so desire.
