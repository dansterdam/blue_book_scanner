The image appears to contain a page from a UFO report document. Unfortunately, there is no visible photograph or image within this particular page. 

As per your request, I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

Sgt Chavez set out to the location while he was driving toward the object. Sgt Chavez took the wrong road, and was in fact heading in the opposite direction from where the object was located. Sgt Chavez said he wasted about 15 minutes before he realized he was going the wrong way. The object was parked about 800 yards from the point where Sgt Chavez turned around. Sgt Chavez was skeptical of the situation and discounted the fact that he had witnessed the object. He said he was tired and hungry, and that the object was gone by the time he arrived at the location. There were no other witnesses, and Sgt Chavez was the only one who had been in position to see the object. Sgt Chavez estimated the area and said it covered approximately 15 feet. He was convinced in his own mind that he had seen an object while investigating the sighting.
