The image appears to be a document page from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's historical program for investigating Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The page does not contain any visible photographs, but rather consists of printed text and data fields. 

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:
