STATEMENT OF LIVINGSTON, RICHARD J.
SCHOOL TRAFFIC PATROLMAN
LIVONIA SCHOOL SYSTEM
LIVONIA, MICHIGAN
ON FEBRUARY 9, 1967, AT APPROXIMATELY 7:55 A.M., I WAS ON DUTY AT THE INTERSECTION OF FARM BROOK DRIVE
AND FARMINGTON ROAD, LIVONIA, MICHIGAN, ASSISTING STUDENTS CROSS THE STREET TO GO TO THE LIVONIA JUNIOR 
HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH IS LOCATED AT THE CORNER OF THAT INTERSECTION. 
WHILE FACING EASTWARD ON FARMINGTON ROAD, I OBSERVED IN THE WESTERN SKY A ROUND, FLAT OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE
HOVERING OVER THE LIVONIA JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL BUILDING. THIS OBJECT WAS VERY BRIGHT AND APPEARED METALLIC IN COLOR. IT 
REMAINED STATIONARY FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES AND THEN ACCELERATED RAPIDLY TO THE NORTH AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.
I CONTINUED MY DUTIES AS SCHOOL CROSSING GUARD UNTIL 8:10 A.M. WHEN MY SHIFT ENDED. I THEN REPORTED THIS INCIDENT
TO THE LIVONIA POLICE DEPARTMENT.
