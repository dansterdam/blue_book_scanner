"5 MILES S. REIMS, FRANCE - VISUAL SIGHTINGS AT TIME OF UFO LANDING AREA
At approx. 9:30 P.M., 7 March 1960, several French Air Force officers observed a brilliant light in the sky near the village of Cernay, about 5 miles S. of Reims, France. The light appeared to be descending slowly towards the ground, leaving a luminous trail behind it. The light was observed for about 45 seconds, then disappeared behind a hill. The observers then drove to the spot where the light had seemed to land and found an elliptical area of scorched and flattened grass, approx. 30 yards long by 15 yards wide. The grass was found to be charred, as though by an intense heat. An analysis by French Air Force Technical Services indicated that some kind of "scorching effect" had taken place at this landing site. No trace of a craft or vehicle was found, only the burned and flattened grass area. The French Air Force officers who witnessed this incident were:
Lt. Col. J. Cicala, Capt. P. J. Nouaillier. Asst. Chief of Operations, Reims Air Base.
Capt. R. Picard, Asst. Electronics Officer, Reims Air Base.
Capt. P. Barrere, Asst. Weather Officer, Reims Air Base. 
They reported the incident to the French Air Force and Air Technical Intelligence Center."
