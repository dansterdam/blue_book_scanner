The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch depicts a compass-like object with some angular measurements or directions labeled.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "X" where the object was first seen. Place an "O" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place a "X" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
