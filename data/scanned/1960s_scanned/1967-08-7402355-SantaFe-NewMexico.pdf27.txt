The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which is a United States Air Force research project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969.

"DEPT/UFO (Maj Quintanilla/70916/mh/30 Sep 67)
UFO Observation & Photographs

Mr.
Lancaster, Pennsylvania 17603

1. Reference your letter of September 21, 1967 in which you furnished additional observations and photographs. If the Air Force is to perform an analysis on your photographs submitted on 21 September, please send along your original negatives in the enclosed envelope. 

2. We do not have the funds or the time to visit everyone who makes unidentified sighting reports. For this reason, the Air Force installation has an UFO investigator who is able to conduct on-the-spot investigations. The present Air Force directive is basically for positive identification of objects rather than elaborate analysis of negatives. If you can assist us in performing the analysis we will be unable to return the negatives to you upon completion of analysis along with our findings.
