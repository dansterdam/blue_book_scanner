DID THE PHENOMENON 
HANG STILL AT ANYTIME? SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SPARKS?
CHANGE SHAPE OR SIZE?
CHANGE DIRECTION?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SEEM LIKE SOMETHING HOT?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

Just definitely recall from 9:15 p.m. front porch see. Called wife, did not inform officers until next day.
