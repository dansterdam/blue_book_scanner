J Well, at first, the television reporter thought that he'd had a nut on his hands, but the more I talked to him, the more he saw that I had seen something. Now, I couldn't tell him what I'd seen, I mean I could explain it, but I couldn't tell him what it was, but he became very interested in it; at first, he set about trying to disprove the theory, I mean, of what I'd seen, and so he called the FAA, the Naval Air Station, and every military installation within a 100 miles and he called the local airport and all airports within a 100 miles trying to pinpoint some aircraft in this area. And he was never able to do so.
H Well, that's very interesting.
J The only thing he could find was a helicopter en route from Alabama to Albany, which was traveling on a line approximately 20 miles north of the area that I was in. And that's the closest aircraft that he could ever pinpoint near me. The FAA said there was no aircraft within this 20 mile range.
H Well, I think that you would have recognized an ordinary aircraft.
J Oh yes, I feel sure that I would have. This boy tried to, he said it was maybe one of these jets that was taking some strobe light photography, that just as came over me I saw one of the strobe lights and then he hit afterburner, and that produced the red glow. He tried to explain it every way he could, but the Navy didn't have any planes in the air at that time, so that sort of ruled it out.
H Yes, I would think so.
J He tried every way to explain it for me, I think, actually, on a very, he was very nice about it. But then since he couldn't explain it, he did the best he could to report what he had.
