SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 5 Mar 65, Washington, D C

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI-GC (Mr.       )
WASHINGTON D C 20330

1. Reference the attached letter from      requesting information on her observation of 5 Mar 65. The following is provided in reply that may be made to her:

a. We have not received any additional reports from 5 Mar 65 in the Washington D C area drawn by Miss      as well as the description of the object and its flight characteristics and the duration of two to three seconds are in accord with many previous reports of meteor observations. This type of meteor was probably not observed by Miss       before on this date. However, in all probability she has previously observed similar celestial phenomena.

2. We wish to express our appreciation for her reporting this observation.
