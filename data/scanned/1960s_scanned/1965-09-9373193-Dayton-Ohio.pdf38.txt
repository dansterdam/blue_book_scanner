The transcribed text from the document is as follows:

"I am writing to report a rather peculiar incident which occurred on the evening of September 9, 1965 in Dayton, Ohio.

I was driving north on Highway 25, north of Dayton, at around 9:45 PM. The night was clear and quite dark. Suddenly, I noticed an extremely bright light in the sky ahead of me, moving rapidly from right to left across my field of vision. 

The light appeared to be shaped like an ellipse, and was much brighter than any star or planet I have ever seen. It seemed to be at an altitude of perhaps 5,000 feet and was moving at a tremendous speed. I would estimate its speed to be around 1,000 mph. As it moved across the sky, it seemed to accelerate and change direction slightly a few times. 

After observing this phenomenon for perhaps 10-15 seconds, the light suddenly disappeared from view. I have no idea where it went or how it could have just vanished. I am not the kind of person who is prone to seeing strange things in the sky, but this was certainly one of the most impressive and perplexing sights I have ever witnessed.

I wanted to report this incident to the proper authorities, in case it may be of interest to your project. If you have any questions or would like any additional information, please let me know.

Yours very truly,

Dayton, Ohio"
