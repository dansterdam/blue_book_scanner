The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a memo routing slip from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

MEMO ROUTING SLIP
TO: T. J. D.
REMARKS: 5-9-11
- Can't tell how the object appeared (from report text). The report says only that it was round, looked like the moon, and was glowing.
