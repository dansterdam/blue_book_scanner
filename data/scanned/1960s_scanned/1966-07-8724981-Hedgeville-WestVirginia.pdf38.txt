plane, it is about the size of a small to medi- um sized plane. My wife awakened me around 3:30 in the morning and called my attention to a strange aerial object in the sky. This was around 4 am July 29 1966. The object was round in shape and about the size of a small plane. It had steady white light shining thru it. It seemed to glow and give off a white light and moved up and down slowly and at an angle. The object was visible for about 15 minutes and then disappeared. It made no noise and was about a mile high, very clear and bright. It seemed to float and then disappear into the darkness. My wife and I both watched it for the entire time it was visible.
