When first sighted, object was on its edge floating down side to side about 10 feet from the ground. When it reached the ground it climbed up about 100 feet, still sliding on its edge. It recessed it flattened out and I noticed the "dome" on top. Over the trees the water vapor circled around moving to a stand still. After it landed, I did not touch the ground but hovered about 10 feet above the ground. It slowly tilted back on its 25 feet diameter and disappeared rapidly into the clouds.
