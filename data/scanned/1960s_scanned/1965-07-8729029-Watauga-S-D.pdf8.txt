34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 23 March 1965
35. Information which you feel is pertinent and is not covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: We had an object pass over our former home in Nicasio, California. The object did not appear to be as large or as bright as the object witnessed by Mack and his children. I would size that while ascending the objects travelled several thousand feet in space of a few seconds. This is the reason for the short duration of ours, between one and 1000 feet of each other. 
On several occasions during the months of August and September 1965, my family and I have sighted similar objects travelling at a set rate of speed from south to north and return. Some were called "Taget Radar" seen manned by the Air Force north of Bismarck and they did not appear to be satellites or planets. These objects were sighted on all occasions these objects passed, whether they were aircraft or balloons. All were sighted at night. I believe the objects of this nature are probably more numerous than indicated during the following months.

NOTE: J. Allen Hynek has requested additional information from me, if it is not given specifically, I would appreciate it if you would furnish this report to Hynek. Hynek is the Scientific Consultant for the Air Force's project Bluebook.
