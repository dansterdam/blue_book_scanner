There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire with written responses.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? - A lighted object approached, and seemed to disappear.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud? - Yes

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? - Yes

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Size - About the size of a match stick b. Color - White to grayish-white

18. We want to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? - 1/3

19. Draw a sketch that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. - A very simple, small white/grayish-white object shape with no details shown.
