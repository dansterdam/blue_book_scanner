TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

May 12, 1967

Dear [REDACTED],

Reference your letter regarding your observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

A detailed investigation revealed that you probably observed the planet Venus, which, at the time of the sighting, was low in the western sky. Venus, with a stellar magnitude of -3.5 on April 3, 1967, would have been the brightest astronomical body in the western sky.

We had no additional reports from your area on the night of April 3, 1967; however, for the past month and a half, Venus has been very prominent in the western sky during the early evening hours.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
