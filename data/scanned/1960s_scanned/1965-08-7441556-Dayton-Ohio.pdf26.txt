35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

This UFO was a metallic object which appeared to be two saucer-like parts joined together. The object hovered over a nearby farmhouse and the perimeter lights appeared to be pulsating. I notified the authorities and a local newspaper reporter interviewed me. They took pictures of the object but I do not know what became of them. I would be glad to provide any further information you may require.
