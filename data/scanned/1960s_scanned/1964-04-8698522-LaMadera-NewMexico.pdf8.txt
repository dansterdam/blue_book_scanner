ZAMORA-LIKE OBJECT SEEN

La Madera, New Mexico, April 26 - Orlanda Gallegos, 35, of Santa Fe, reportedly was a witness to an elliptical object similar in description to the one observed by Patrolman Zamora in his father's home north of Soccoro, New Mexico. While occupied in the activity of chasing stray horses, he noted an unusual craft resting upon the ground in a pasture. Some 200 feet distant. The object was described as being about the length of this telephone pole, with a circumference of 14 feet. Ringing of a blue flame emitted from jets about its underside. An attempting to persuade his family not to mention the incident, he was particularly unsuccessful, for they were too frightened by it. The next morning, however, they all examined the landing area, nothing particular to be noticed by them from the previous night. State Police Captain Martin Virgin, upon checking the charred area, noticing that the rocks present within the charred landing site 'crushed. Green Brush in the surrounding area had been set afire, evidently from intense heat. Four deep impressions and unusual 'pass-prints' resembling those of a flourish Lian, were also seen.

The Air Force, although having sent investigators into the area, has thus far remained silent on their findings, if any.
