ATIC Capability for Investigating Sightings of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

AFCIN-Pl4 (l/Col Sullivan)

1. A briefing on the Air Force Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program was held with members of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Committee, House Space and Astronautics Committee and CIA on 15 July 1959. During this discussion, it was indicated that due to the usually limited technical capability of the Air Force bases involved, ATIC should continue the investigation on those cases wherein indications of hostile intent or technical surveillance are involved.

2. The ATIC Aerial Phenomena Group is presently staffed with one commissioned officer and one non-commissioned officer. To adequately conduct the additional function of investigation of significant sightings, this office requires the assignment of an additional officer.

3. It is estimated that it will cost $3,000 per year travel funds to implement this capability. 

4. The necessary action has been initiated at this level to obtain both the additional personnel and funds required to carry out this operation.
