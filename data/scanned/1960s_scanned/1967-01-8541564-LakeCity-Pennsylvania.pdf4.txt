TRANSCRIPTION:

I cannot say this thing has not much evidence of any kind, there seems to have been some discussion, but as yet no proof which I considered of sufficient importance to call the attention of the project, or command higher headquarters. I do not wish to be understood as casting any reflection as to the value of the reports - they were proper reports as they should be made, and those making them did their job in a worthy manner. I am, however, of the opinion that the case was one in which no positive identification could be made with certainty, and therefore it was not appropriate for project consideration.

1. Temperature  
2. Wind Speed  
3. Wind Direction  
4. Visibility  
5. Sky Condition  
6. Ceiling  
7. Precipitation  

P.S. I do not wish to infer that the evidence was Insufficient to warrant a report, my inference is that it was reportable, but the lack of definite identification did not warrant project consideration.
