Dear Sir,

I just wanted to write you due to a sighting I had the other night around 8:00 P.M. As I was driving home from work, I saw an object in the sky which seemed to glow a reddish orange color. It was hovering there for some time and then it started moving from side to side and up and down. At times it would just hang in the sky motionless. I had my son with me at the time and he too saw the object. We watched it for approximately 30 to 35 minutes. It was quite a sight to see. I've never seen anything like it before. 

I am wondering if you would be interested in hearing more details about what I saw. I would be happy to tell you more about it if you are interested. Please let me know if you would like me to provide any additional information.

Sincerely,
