THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

PLACE AN "X" ON THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+* AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "+" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "+". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT
