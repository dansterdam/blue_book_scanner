The image contains a diagram and some text. The diagram shows a semicircular chart with angle measurements from 0 to 90 degrees, and at the top right there is a smaller diagram of what appears to be a compass rose or sun symbol. Below the diagrams, there is text that describes the instructions for using the diagrams.

Text transcription:
27. In the following sketch, indicate that you are at the point shown. Place a "*" on the same course line as the object, then place a "X" on the same azimuth as the object. If the object is at the edge of the sketch, place a "+" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "V" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a sketch that will show the direction that the object or objects made. Place a "+" at the beginning of the path, and a "*" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Give a picture of how they were arranged, and any other information that they were traveling.
