Here is the text output from the OCR (optical character recognition) of the document:

On 6 March 1960 an unidentified object was observed in the skies near Unalakleet, Alaska. The report states that the object was seen by two civilians, a pilot, and a co-pilot of a commercial aircraft. The object was described as a "saucer-shaped" craft that was initially observed near the ground, then climbed vertically at a rapid rate of speed before disappearing from view. The object made no sound and displayed no lights. The document indicates that the observation was investigated by the United States Air Force.

The report also mentions that the commanding officer of the 5001st Radar Evaluation Squadron at Elmendorf Air Force Base concurred with the findings of the investigation. Copies of the letter were forwarded to the Commander, Alaskan Air Command and the Director of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF.
