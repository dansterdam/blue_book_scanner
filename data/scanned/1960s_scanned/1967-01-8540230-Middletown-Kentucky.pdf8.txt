The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified aerial object. The sketch shows a circular or spherical object with smoke or exhaust trails trailing behind it.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
It seemed to burn out.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
Yes.      No.      Don't know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes.      No.      Don't know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what it was in front of.
The clouds (it was lower than the clouds)

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - silent, no sound
b. Color - white outlined in blue with a blue tail

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object would have been covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About half (1 guess)

19. Draw a picture as will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.
