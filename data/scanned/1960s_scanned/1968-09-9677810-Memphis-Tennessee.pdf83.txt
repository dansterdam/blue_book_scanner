Dear Sir:
I would like to report a sighting of an UFO. I am a sophomore at Christian Brothers College in Memphis, Tennessee, majoring in Electrical Engineering. The following is what occurred:
"It was about 9:08 PM on Monday September 30, 1968, when I left our campus radio station. I had been talking to______, the Chief Engineer, about the distortion of the audio. I told him that I was going back to the room and listen in. I just got out in the open, when I looked up and spotted an object about the size of a dime held at arms length. I watched it for a few seconds, and then realized that there was no sound. Since both______ and I are UFO enthusiasts, I ran back down to the station and told him about it. He came back with me, and we watched it for about two minutes.
The object was a reddish color which seemed to fade once in a while. It was also constant, that is it did not flash. We also noticed that it had a sort of football shape. The object seemed to be at a fairly high altitude, but we were convinced that it was not an aircraft because it did not have the proper marking lights, and the course seemed to be erratic. We watched it till it seemed to turn to the east, and vanished. The entire incident lasted approximately two minutes and thirty seconds. This is not the first time we've seen one, but this is the first one I am reporting in writing. The others we reported to the Millington Naval Air Station, but this time they told me to write."
