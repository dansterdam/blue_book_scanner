The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and written text. The diagram appears to be a compass with directions and angles labeled. The written text describes the diagram and asks the viewer to imagine a visual sketch and draw a picture to show the motion of the observed object(s).

The text from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

"A" about 45 degrees, "B" about 80 degrees, green sphere in east direction. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

A all at a very irregular course, erratic and up and down or sideways erratic motion.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?

At about all 6 formed a line, almost north to south and remained stationary.
