UFO REPORT ***24 April 1964***

I, Richard T. Holder, Captain, USAF, 054612, UP-Range Commander, was notified by Lt. Richard L. Hopkins, USAF, 1365412, personnel that at approximately 1906 hrs on 8 April 1964, Dr. Arthur Byrnes Jr., GS-15, Credentials Number 3517, Federal Bureau of Investigation, USAF OIP Det 63, AIG, 7321, had been contacted in conjunction with the investigation of a UFO sighting in the Canyon Ferry Reservoir area, near Helena, Montana, on 8 April 1964, which was reported unsuccessfully, then started dressing. While dressing he noticed on the north side of the reservoir a bright light. He estimated that it was at an elevation of approximately 35 minutes of arc, and at an azimuth of 060 degrees true. He observed the light with binoculars and stated that it appeared to be a blue-white light that flickered and pulsated. The light was observed for 3-4 minutes, then disappeared.

We both then interviewed Officer Beers, US and this is so substantially represented in the recorded interview with Officer Beers, that we are omitting a further interview of him. Officer Beers was awakened by the residence of Sgt. Castle, USAID SPC-5, MP, who then accompanied us to the location where the UFO was first observed. When we arrived at the location, the light was no longer visible. We then interviewed M/Sgt. Keenan, also of the Socorro Police Department, who assisted in relaying the measurements. When we arrived at the Socorro Office location in the Socorro County Building, we were informed by Sgt. Lopez that Dr. Byrnes had left. At approximately 1750 I was notified by Lt. Hicks at approximately 1750 that the investigation was completed. The film exposure of the light was attempted but unsuccessful. The reports were completed at approximately 0200 25 April. I requested that I be notified in the event of a similar occurrence or report.
