The text in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
IT TWINKLED AND WENT OUT ABRUPTLY

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?

16. Did the object come in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
