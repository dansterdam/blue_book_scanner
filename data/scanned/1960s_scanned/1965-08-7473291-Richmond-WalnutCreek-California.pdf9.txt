REF: UFO REPORTS 0130-62001 11 AUG 65
MACINTOSH PLANETARIUM (G.G.PARK) (221-5106 ET 71) WAS PHONED FOR ANY INFO THEY MIGHT HAVE ON UFO SIGHTINGS DURING PAST 7 DAYS.
"ANYTHING" DURING PAST 7 NIGHTS OF A CELESTIAL OR SPECTACULAR NATURE WHICH MIGHT EXCITE THE VIEWER'S IMAGINATION.
MR. GATES, MANAGER OF PLANETARIUM, REPORTED HE PERSONALLY SIGHTED THE REPORTED LIGHTS & WAS GREATLY IMPRESSED BY THE ILLUSIONARY EFFECT WHICH WAS CREATED BY REFLECTED MOONLIGHT.
AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING A RARE & INTENSE ELECTRICAL STORM WAS IN PROGRESS & A WHILE LATER THUNDER HEADS WERE SHOWING RAPIDLY WITH ERRATIC STATIONARY THUNDERHEADS. MOONLIGHT WAS REFLECTING FROM THE TOPS OF THE THUNDERHEADS THRU THE LOWER LAYER CLOUDS - INTENSITY VARIED AS LIGHT RAYS WERE CUT OFF BY LOWER CLOUDS - CREATING AN ILLUSION OF DANCING LIGHTS.
MR. GATES STATED HE WAS FASCINATED BY THE SPECTACULAR DISPLAY & VOICED THE OPINION THAT THERE WOULD BE NUMEROUS UFO REPORTS FORTHCOMING.
