with the problem of extraterrestrial life, a large number of mineralogists, physicists, biologists, etc., everywhere are studying meteorites. The proof of the existence of organic substances in meteorites would support the existence of life outside the earth, no matter what the ultimate origin of meteorites might be. But in this problem, as in all other problems concerning extraterrestrial life, there is no simple answer and no convincing proof of the existence of life. The problem has recently been reviewed by A. A. Imshenetskiy (1966), Director of the Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences, USSR, where many investigations of such nature are being carried out.

There are three items in meteorites which must be considered in this connection:
(a) Carbonaceous chondrites are stony meteorites which have some carbon matter (up to five per cent of weight) of possible organic origin. At the present time there are 30 meteorites of this class, which can be divided into three sub-classes quite different from each other. At first it seemed that this is indisputable proof of the cosmic origin of organic matter, but later researches proved this improbable. The carbonaceous matter is now considered to be of inorganic origin and similar to matter found in terrestrial rocks.
(b) "Organized elements" in the same meteorites are small
