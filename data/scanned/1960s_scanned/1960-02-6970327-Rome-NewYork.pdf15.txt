FLASH LIGHTS UP SKIES OVER FOUR-STATE AREA
SAN LEANDRO, CALIF., DEC. 2.- (AP)- Several reports came to the attention of the Air Force tonight of mysterious flashing lights in the sky over a four-state area. 
Capt. W.F. Devor, USAF, public information officer at Hamilton Air Force Base, said reports came from California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Capt. Devor said he did not have details of the reports, but the Air Force was investigating. 
"These reports seemed to have been about 30 miles south of Tracy, Calif., northward to Coast Hills and eastward to Butte, Altana," Capt. Devor said. "The apparent origin was apparently a point somewhere near Tracy, Calif."
There is also a quote from a letter from the Congressional Inquiry Division, Office of Legislative Liaison, Department of the Air Force, dated February 29, 1960, stating that the 7 February 1960 UFO sighting in the northwest was not reported to the Air Force's Project Blue Book for analysis or evaluation.
