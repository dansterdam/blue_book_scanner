Dear Mom and Dad,

Let me start off by saying that the UFOs (the flying saucers) are still here in Ground at about every night. This has been causing a lot of discussion and talk about over radio City and people are telling to look up in the sky and there is those unidentified flying objects going through the sky and some people are asking to call this a natural phenomenon. It has seem that this now down to all natural phenomenon. And also would like to know that these UFOs are more than just a natural phenomenon as they are becoming more numerous to be considered a collection of individual signals that something unusual is going on. I could just sat the real truth of which is honestly believe that everyone should know about it. 

You say that it is a a natural phenomenon? That maybe. Bow I believe that these apparitions and apparitions don't tell and never will. Maybe you are right, who am I to say other. But I myself have the feeling that this is more than a natural phenoonenon. From the facts I have been getting out, it is my honest opinion that there is something very unusual going on. I am unable to prove it through scientific examination which some think can be done. I know of no one that has been able to disapprove it either. And that is about this time we can only wait and see what develops.

Just now we come across seeding from the sky. The Navy too has seen this and report on it. It's on page 15-22.

So far there has been nothing to prove that there are flying discs (or saucers) as many people call them.
I hope Mom, I have been receiving your letters in Mexico. I appreciate everything.
