The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a series of questions and the respondent's handwritten answers.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? The object appeared to be travelling in a straight line and then suddenly disappeared, apparently out of sight.

15. Did the object move behind something or into a cloud? (Circle one): (No)  Don't Know.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle one): Yes  (No)  Don't Know. 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: The sound of the object was a faint whistling sound.
b. Color: Metallic silver in color, with a bright glow.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? The match head would have covered approximately 1/4 to 1/3 of the width of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object such as wings, protrusions, etc. and specifically indicate trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.
