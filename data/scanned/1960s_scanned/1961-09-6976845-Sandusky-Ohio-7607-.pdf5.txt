PROJECT BLUE BOOK
CASE NO. 7607
SANDOSKY, OHIO
6 SEPTEMPER 1961
1. NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
At approximately 2140 hours on 6 September 1961, the Aerial Observations Officer received a telephone call from a civilian witness reporting an unidentified aerial object. The witness stated that he had observed a bright, disc-shaped object hovering over a lake near Sandusky, Ohio. The witness described the object as being approximately 50 feet in diameter and emitting a bright, pulsing light. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.
2. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
The witness provided a detailed description of the object, including its size, shape, and lighting characteristics. However, no other independent witnesses were located to corroborate the sighting. Additionally, no physical evidence or photographic documentation was obtained. Based on the limited information available, the sighting could not be conclusively identified as a known aerial phenomenon.
3. CONCLUSION:
This case remains unidentified due to the lack of additional witness testimony and physical evidence to corroborate the reported observation. The sighting is classified as unresolved.
