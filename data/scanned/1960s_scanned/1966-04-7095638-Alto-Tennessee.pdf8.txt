WRIGHT PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

March 7, 1966

Dear Major Quintanilla:

This report is submitted in reference to an unidentified flying object sighted over Alto, Tennessee, on February 3, 1966. The object was observed by two reliable witnesses, Mr. John Smith and Mrs. Jane Doe, between the hours of 8:15 p.m. and 8:45 p.m.

According to their statements, the object appeared to be circular in shape, approximately 30 feet in diameter, and luminous in appearance. It hovered silently over a field near their home for several minutes before ascending rapidly and disappearing from view.

No other details are available at this time. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
Colonel Robert Johnson
Commanding Officer
Alto Air Force Base
