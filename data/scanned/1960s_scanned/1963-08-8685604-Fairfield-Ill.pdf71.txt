The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report documenting a UFO sighting.

24 August 1963 -- Light fog was beginning to form in the area. The witness indicated that he leaned over to say something to his girl friend and at that time sighted a flashing glimpse of what he determined to be the moon. We say flashing glimpse because it is obvious it was probably more concerned with the clarity and operation of the vehicle.

The witness was driving his girl friend home. His attention was then transferred to the front.

The moon was also the cause of the sighting at the girl's house. He indicated that the object followed him home; that the Marshall and a State Trooper were summoned; that the Marshall sighted the object and commented that it was the "Evening Star." The Air Force did not have to come up with a unique explanation on this one, only to affirm what the Marshall had said -- the object was Jupiter. Jupiter was low on the horizon in the east, and more than 5 times as bright as anything else in the area. Because of its distance it would appear to follow.
