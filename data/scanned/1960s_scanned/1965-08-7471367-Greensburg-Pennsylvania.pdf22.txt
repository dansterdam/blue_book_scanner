There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page of the UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The document contains only text, which I will now transcribe:

January 12,

To: Major Hector Quintanilla USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
AFCIN-XETB, Air Force Base
Washington 25, D.C.

This is to report a call I made to Mr. G
Pennsylvania, relative to his sightings of August 11th and August 17th, 1965, and the sightings of his wife, of August 5th, 1965.

Mr. G now runs his own business called General Company, Inc. which is not only a business but maintenance and programing of devising means of furnishing real time computer services to business organizations, etc. Until he began his own company he was a nuclear physicist with Westinghouse in Pittsburgh, who has since devised a nuclear rocket propulsion system which is now under consideration by the group.

I had a long talk with him. He is not only scientifically oriented, but he is also a member of the Pittsburgh Academy of Science. He apparently sees into these intriguing events with the lucidity of a trained observer.

The group, however, to hear his story. At any rate, his interest stems largely from the idea of linking a number of these up with his so-called "cases", reported to NICAP, of one of the Pittsburgh firms who is interested in his work. The been highly distorted and then landed in a nearby field. NICAP has this report, and coming to his particular sightings: In all three cases a bright light, apparently very much brighter than she, when and then fading out as they approached the horizon. Their speed, as far as motion satellites, as to veer suddenly was concerned, was good except for a bright light, supposedly very much brighter than any known stars, about which he lists altitude and azimuth.
