Las Vegas, Nevada, August 15, 1966

Dear Dr. J. Allen Hynek,

On the evening of August 25, 1966, while investigating a report of a UFO sighting in the area of Dayton, Ohio (Boyton (?), Ohio), we encountered an incident which seemed merits reporting to your office.

At approximately 9:10 PM, while on patrol, [REDACTED] and I observed a brilliant yellowish white light hovering about 200 yards above ground level in a southerly direction. The object appeared to be stationary and circular in shape. The light was so brilliant that it was difficult to determine the outline or silhouette of the object. The light remained steady, not blinking or pulsating, for approximately 3 to 4 minutes, after which it began to dim and move in a southerly direction slowly and disappear from view.

Careful analysis of the incident by [REDACTED] and myself indicated that the object was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or astronomical body. Its brilliance, circular shape, and stationary hovering flight characteristics are not typical of any known airborne object in this area.

The incident was reported immediately to the Dayton Air Force Base and a teletype message was sent to your office at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio. We await your comments and any further instructions you may have regarding this matter.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
Investigator
