20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arms' length in line with a known object, and note how many times the object is contained in the angular size. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object could have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that we may obtain as precise as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when passed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Remainder not of interest.
