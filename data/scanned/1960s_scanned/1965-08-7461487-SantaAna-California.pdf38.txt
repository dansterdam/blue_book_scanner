The image does not contain a photograph. The document appears to be a typed report from Project Blue Book describing a UFO sighting in Santa Ana, California on August 22. The key details mentioned in the text are:

FLYING OBJECT CAUGHT ON FILM IN CALIFORNIA: On August 22nd, a county highway patrol officer photographed a UFO which was flying near the Marine Corps Air Force facility. The object was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter and 8 to 10 feet thick. It was in sight for only about 15 seconds. 

The witness also stated that he tried to communicate by two-way radio with his superiors but was found the radio inoperative, possibly due to electromagnetic disturbances caused by the presence of the UFO.

At least one other sighting was made in the vicinity of the Marine base on the same day as the incident described in the report.
