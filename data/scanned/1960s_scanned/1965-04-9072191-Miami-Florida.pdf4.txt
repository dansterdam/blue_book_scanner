This page of the UFO report document from Project Blue Book does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten letter addressed to "Dear Sirs", where the author is requesting information and research on unidentified flying objects. The letter is signed by "No Name, 307", with a location listed as "Florida, 32234".

Dear Sirs,

I am writing a research grade paper on the subject of unidentified flying objects. I would appreciate any information and statistics you can provide me on the subject. Please research as many cases that have been reported for the public.

Thank you for your time. It would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
No Name, 307
Florida, 32234
