Call From Mrs Jim Young of 5569 Shady Oak, Dayton, Ohio.
Last night, 13 Jul 66 at approximately 930pm she saw a light like a beacon. She felt the heat of it for an instance. Observed it for an instant. Like a red light, like a beacon was a blue white flash. She said she was just having a hot flash and she said she was too young for that. It was just like an X-Ray Sent her a form 164 to complete (13 Jul 1966)
