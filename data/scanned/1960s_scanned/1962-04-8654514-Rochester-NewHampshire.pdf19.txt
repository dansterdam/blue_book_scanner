The image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it shows a page from a form or report related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page includes questions and blank spaces for the observer to provide information about the observed object, such as its size, motion, and disappearance.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
22. We wish to know the answer else. Hold a march stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a connected account of the object or objects which you saw.
