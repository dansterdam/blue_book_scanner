The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten letter describing a sighting of a strange object in the sky. The letter mentions that the object was like a "small ball or metallic thing that went out in the sky and that it was not going fast at all."

Parkersburg,

Dear Sirs:-

We talked to Mr. D-- in Ohio, and he said he saw a strange thing the latter several weeks ago, he said he saw it too. 
He wrote to you about it. He told us you want us to tell you about it also.
It was round, and it looked in the after - noon, it was like a small ball something like a satellite, lighting behind it, it was a green and yellow and a little - red all mixed in - swirls with a white rough line around it.
It was in the N-E and went to the N-W, then it passed like a balloon, swiftly all thing went out in the sky and that is all. It was not going fast at all. We called Mr. D---s, but he didn't come, he was fixing supper.
My sister's sister Vicky, who is one Mr. C-- than me saw it too - she lives here too.
Mr. C--- said it some. We are 9 years old. I got the mumps and in bed. Oh yes it was as big as a basket ball.
