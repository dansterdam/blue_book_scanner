Dear Sir:
This is a report on my sighting of a UFO over this locality. Evening in question came about 10:30 p.m. I was returning home, just a routine trip. As I neared the edge of town, I noticed out of the corner of my eye a very bright light, red in color, and it seemed to be hovering just above the horizon, slightly to the east. It was a beautiful sight, very colorful and brilliant. I stopped the car and observed it for a moment. The light seemed to move very slowly up and down in vertical motion, perhaps 20 to 30 feet or so. I watched it for around 3 minutes, then it started to go down very slowly. Just before it went out of sight, it seemed to sway a bit from side to side. This happened at about 10:00 o'clock, here - I report this time, as I looked at my watch. I live in the vicinity of the Beach to the Battle Ground and am used to seeing the planes overhead from 7:30 to 10:00 o'clock, but this was certainly not a plane. The object was hovering from 10:00 to 10:03 o'clock. I have never seen anything like it before in my life.
I hope this report is of some value to you in your study of these sightings. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to write.

Sincerely yours,
