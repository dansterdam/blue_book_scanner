The image contains a sketch that appears to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The sketch includes a diagram and instructions for the observer, with references to placing an "A" and "B" on the diagram to indicate the position and motion of an observed object. There is also a compass rose or direction indicator in the top right corner of the image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. These storage bins close together, actual numbers of them.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
