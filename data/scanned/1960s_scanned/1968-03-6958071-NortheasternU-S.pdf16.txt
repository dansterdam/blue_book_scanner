The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, with a table describing various characteristics of a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT CERTAINI
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPLIT LIKE A "TOP"?
CHANGE COLORS?

I was not paying much attention until my son said, "look at that what is it?"

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
out of sight

IS THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEING OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
