SUBJECT: 

TO: SAFOI

1. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, by memorandum dated 9 January 1960, advised this Headquarters that the subject film, allegedly showing a UFO, was received by the FBI from the Commanding Officer of the Air Force Base, and that the film was forwarded to the White House. After examining the film and preparing his slides, the addressee notified the FBI that he was not able to identify the photographed object as an unusual aerial device. He stated that due to the limited background as appeared in the pictures, it was impossible to determine the size, distance, or altitude of the object. He further stated that due to the low quality of the photographic slides involved, it was not practical to have them analyzed on a scientific basis.

2. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, by memorandum dated 7 March 1960, furnished additional information and photographic slides received from the addressee who had secured them from the Civil Defense Director, Mr. D. District, who reported he had secured them from the Commanding Officer and citizens of the General Area in Accordance with AFR 200-2.

3. Attached for your information and any action deemed appropriate is a copy of Directive from the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning the film and photographic slides. The Directive is addressed to President, USAF, WPON, D.C., by District Director, OD District.
