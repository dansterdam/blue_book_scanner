The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a typed document with text describing a UFO observation on 22 April 1969 in Ruston, Louisiana.

The text of the document is as follows:

TOP (USAF)

The description is similar to other reports we have received describing 
22 Apr 69 UFO activity. It is not air balloons (see enclosed description).

Thank you for your interest and cooperation.
