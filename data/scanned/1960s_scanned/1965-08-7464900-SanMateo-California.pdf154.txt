The flying light again: On August 3, 1965, in the village of Vallenar, Chile, several residents sighted an unusual light phenomenon. According to the reports, a strange appearing luminous object hovered over the center of the village and seemed to flash light intermittently. Many persons in the village gathered and watched this phenomenon for almost an hour. Most people kept a respectful distance, although some brave souls came nearer for a closer view. The object appeared to be surrounded by a luminous haze or field. At times it resembled a bright star, but then suddenly flashed its light in different directions. During the time it was observed, it performed no rapid or erratic maneuvers, but rather just hovered in the sky, emitting flashes of light. When it finally disappeared, the witnesses stated that it had not moved away, but rather that the light just went out and it was gone. There was no sound associated with the object. The villagers, after the encounter, were quite puzzled and disturbed by what they had seen. They had the impression that the object was under intelligent control, but could not understand its purpose in visiting their village. The sighting caused quite a sensation locally and was reported in the newspapers.
