The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an official U.S. Air Force document, specifically a questionnaire filled out by a witness reporting a UFO sighting.

Official U.S. Air Force
5 APRIL 1957
Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the
questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
THE OBJECT WAS SMALL AND THEY APPROACHED IT TO WITHIN
THE TWO AIRCRAFT EACH OTHER STAYED. THE THING
THEN CHANGED TO BRILLIANT I THEY WERE AMAZED! I FELT THEY WERE ABOUT
LOST WHICH JUST HAVE BEEN BECAUSE TO SEE AT A DISTANCE I SAW
WHY ONLY ONE PASSING. WITHIN THE THIRD OTHER TWO
THERE AND THEN WENT WAS IT.
I could approximate in was a more in form than
could describe as a saucer to me. Thank you.
