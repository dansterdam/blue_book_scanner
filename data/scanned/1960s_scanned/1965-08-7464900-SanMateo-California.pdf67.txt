"FLYING SAUCER" SIGHTINGS" 
Houston area. -- Reliable 15 to 20 persons reported sightings of what appeared to be a large bright light of unknown purpose in the sky Wednesday to report "existence". One person described it as "like a moon," another as "soareer than star," others said they saw "shooting beams of light," "saucer-like evasive movements," balls and bar shapes. One person suggested it was a "mother ship" with "little ones" breaking off from it. Several suggested it was a "craft" controlled by some intelligent being.
One man said a group of witnesses had seen it split into 2 parts. Another reported an object rise from the ground and join the large "saucer." Several reported seeing it take off at a high rate of speed, disappearing as it went "straight up." The Houston International Airport and the Houston Intercontinental Air Force Base reported nothing unusual in their observations. As customary, the Air Force said their radar did not pick up any such objects, but the sightings were nevertheless reported to the Air Force.
