There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire or form with various questions about the sighting of a UFO object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound, b. Color
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head? If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc, and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
