NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF ANY OBJECT OR PERSON HAVING BEEN IN THE 
AREA OF THE ALLEGED SIGHTING. IN MY OPINION, THIS WAS A " PUBLIC 
CITY STUNT"- MY REASON FOR SAYING THIS IS THAT MRS. X IS A
RECENTLY WIDOWED MOTHER OF 4 CHILDREN. THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE
OF POVERTY IN HER HOUSE. AND THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT SHE
FABRICATED THIS ACCOUNT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTRACTING ATTENTION,
AND SYMPATHY FOR HERSELF, AND HER FAMILY. CHARLOD L. SESSIONS,
SNOIC. 2920/DEC/1952. I, MRS. X, STATED THAT AT THE TIME,
THAT SHE SAW THE OBJECT SHE WAS TAKING AN ASPIRIN IN HER KICHEN.
SHE LOOKED OUT OF THE KITCHEN AND OBSERVED AN OBJECT WHICH "WAS
LIT UP WITH VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS AND HAD WINDOWS SPACED APPROXIMATE-
LY 2 FEET APART." SIMULTANEOUSLY SHE HEARD HER TV, AND SAW HER 
LIGHTS WEAKEN. SHE FOUND OUT LATER THAT HER NEIGHBOR, MRS
X, COULD NOT CHANGE TV CHANNEL OR TURN OFF TV DUE TO THIS BRIEF
DISTURBANCE. NO VISUAL DISPLAY LOW SPOT MOVING.
STATIONARY NOT HOVERING.
