UFO Observation, 20 November 1967

Athens, Ohio [REDACTED]

1. Reference your unidentified observation of 20 November 1967. The FORM 117 which you completed shows the object as appearing in roughly the east and disappearing in roughly the north-northeast. Unfortunately, the form can be misleading as to the course of the object. Did the object seem to be approaching toward you at an angle (getting larger), staying the same distance, or moving away at an angle (getting smaller)? How certain are you of your directions? Did you use a compass? Since the sighting, have you talked to anyone else who saw the object? If so, could you provide their names and addresses?

2. This additional information is necessary before we can evaluate your sighting. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
