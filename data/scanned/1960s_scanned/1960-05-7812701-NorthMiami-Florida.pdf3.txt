"AFFIDAVIT

Commander, 2556th Airborne, Sq.mn. 
Eglin AFB, Fla.
field international Airport
Miami, Florida

Attention: Captain D.R. Boggs

This is to certify that on the evening of May 25, 1960 at 10:35 P.M., E.S.T., I was returning for the night flight to determine 15 day work flying hours under night conditions.

In the course of my casual observation, my attention was drawn to a brilliant light, that the light suddenly moved toward the north. I immediately determined that this was no normal aircraft. It moved at high speed and seemed to gain altitude rapidly, then it suddenly reversed its course and moved back in the general direction from which it came, a distance of approximately one-half mile. It then appeared to drop back to its original position, although it did not return to its exact former position as it was observed to be slightly higher. 

The light or object was observed to have an intensity of approximately twice the normal intensity of any star in its vicinity at that time. Its motion was erratic, and not in the normal flight pattern of any known aircraft. When it moved in its southerly direction, it became a definite phosphorescent green in color. When it reversed its course and moved northward, it appeared to be a brilliant white light. The maneuver was repeated several times. Although it did not return to its exact former position, it was continually observed for a period of over twenty-three (23) seconds.

A period of one hour and ten minutes elapsed before the light or object ceased to be observed in the sky, although it did not return to its exact former position as it was observed to be slightly higher. The maneuver was repeated several times."
