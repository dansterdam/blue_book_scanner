1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of 21 October 1967 at Blytheville AFB, Arkansas.

Your sighting was a bright object in the sky brighter than a star. The object entered the atmosphere and broke into several smaller pieces. These pieces traveled slowly toward the southwest and were visible for approximately fifteen seconds.

The meteor was also observed by the crew members of several different aircraft in the same area. This meteor has been observed previously and recorded in the Air Force records. However, there is not enough information to identify the exact nature of this phenomenon.

2. Once again, thank you for reporting your observation.
