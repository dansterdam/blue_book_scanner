There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text found in the document is as follows:

Statement, included at Blue Book, to the effect that the witness would travel in a vehicle approaching his car, which was absolutely incorrect, if the witness is to be believed stated that the object suddenly sped up and rushed away. There is nothing in my files to indicate that the witness stated, "There is no other object I have ever seen with red lights that were as brilliant."

Finally, witness became frightened because object came closer and yet said there was no sound. Unless one is willing to call this an absolute hallucination, this can no physical contact present whatsoever, the "aircraft" simply won't hold up.

This case is sufficiently interesting for me to investigate further, as there were two witnesses, independent and called about it only after each had seen the object.

I will make this personal investigation and report

23. 3 April 1967, Roseville, Michigan. 
I would agree with the evaluation of possible bird-support to be insufficient also add, possible unknown insufficient. The card indicates only 10 to 12 lights observed in v formation. This actually strengthens the "possible bird" evaluation.

This is not in my files.

25. 5 April 1967, Westminster, Colorado.
Since Case 164 was continued the evaluation "insufficient information" seems to me, is entirely correct, but the case itself is significant, since it was right at their back. Should have looked into it particularly since there were telescope observations. Also the object was visible for 15 minutes, and it was a telescope. Even at this late date this might be worth a recheck, myself, but for the statistics, the evaluation "insufficient" holds.
