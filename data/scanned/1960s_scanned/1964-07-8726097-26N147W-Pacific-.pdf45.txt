I stood amazed at the scene. The plane came barreling out of nowhere, almost on top of me in a matter of seconds. It wasn't any type of aircraft I had ever seen before. The light around it was eery and flashing. Though I had just flashed my flashlight at it to see if I could get its attention, the plane seemed to ignore me completely as it rocketed by only a few hundred feet above me. I stood there stunned for quite some time, trying to comprehend what I had just witnessed.
