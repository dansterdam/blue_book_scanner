Dear Sirs:

During the past few years, I have been tempted to report a UFO which I have observed on several occasions. However, I was somewhat reluctant to file the report. Recently, though, I read that a renowned psychologist had undertaken a studied program of UFO investigation and that he felt that a serious study of UFO reports might be of value in his research. I have decided to report my sighting, which may be of value in his research.

At about 4:30 p.m. on May 26, 1960, I was walking east on West Main Avenue near my home. Being an air traffic buff, I noticed something unusual in the sky. I looked up and spotted the object. The object was approximately 200 yards from me, and about 75 feet above the ground. It seemed to be moving due west at a speed of about 200 yards per second. The shape of the object was similar to the silver diecast metal toy airplanes I played with as a child. The color was the same as the silver enamel paint which I used on model airplanes. My estimate was that it was 50 feet long and 30 feet high and had a rounded upper surface. I watched it for about 10 seconds as it moved in a straight line in a westerly direction. Now that I discussed shape distortion with a friend, it moved in a straight line, but seemed to distort or wobble slightly as it went. I ran back to my home about 100 yards away to get binoculars. As I reached the door, the object was gone, but I think I should have still been able to see it at the distance it was going.
