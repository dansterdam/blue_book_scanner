The image appears to be a photograph showing a blurred, indistinct object or phenomenon in the sky. The background appears to be dark, with some silhouetted shapes, possibly indicating a landscape or buildings in the distance. The object itself is difficult to make out, appearing as a hazy, indistinct shape against the lighter background.

1. At approximately 2000 hours on 6 December 1967, I received a call from [REDACTED], who stated that he had observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over Lansing, Michigan.
2. [REDACTED] stated that the object was visible for approximately 10-15 minutes and was last seen heading in a north-easterly direction.
3. [REDACTED] stated that the object appeared to be round in shape, approximately 10-15 feet in diameter, and that it was illuminated with a bright reddish-orange glow.
4. [REDACTED] stated that the object appeared to be hovering and then suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed.
5. [REDACTED] stated that he had attempted to get a photograph of the object, but that the photograph did not turn out very well due to the poor lighting conditions.
6. [REDACTED] stated that he was very concerned about what he had observed and requested that I investigate the matter further.
7. I have forwarded this report to the appropriate authorities for further investigation.
