The object of the investigation is plausible and the carcass that the officer saw, considered in the light of these other circumstances, would suggest that something has been taking place here that is not of a normal character. he is not as yet made over to know that. It is also a matter of how the carcass was exhibited and who saw it. Unfortunately, the report on this incident does not give any indication of this. Although the officer is entitled to his opinion, the evidence at hand is obviously not conclusive, and more detailed information would be required before any definite conclusion could be reached.
