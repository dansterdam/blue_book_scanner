SUMMARY:
At approximately 8:55 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 March 1967,
Mr. John C. Smith, of 1234 Main Street, Youngstown,
Ohio, reported seeing an unusual aerial object in the sky south
of his residence. 
Mr. Smith stated that he was outside his home when he observed a bright, glowing, circular object moving in a northerly
direction at a high rate of speed. The object appeared to
change colors from white to orange to red as it moved across
the sky. It was visible for approximately 2-3 minutes before
disappearing from view. 
No other witnesses were reported. Weather conditions at the
time were clear with light winds.
Project Blue Book has evaluated the reported sighting and 
determined that the object was most likely a meteor or re-entering
space debris.
