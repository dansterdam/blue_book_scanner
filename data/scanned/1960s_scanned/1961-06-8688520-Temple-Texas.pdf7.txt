The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text extracted from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made, the path, a "trail" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or one's arm's length in line with the object. If you had performed this measurement, how much of the match stick would have been covered by the apparent size of the object?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the objects or objects which, when placed in the sky, would give the same appearance as that which you observed.
