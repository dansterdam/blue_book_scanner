July 29, 1963

Dear Mr. -------,

As you requested, enclosed is a sighting report concerning a UFO sighting over Garden City, Michigan. This office is not in a position to provide an evaluation.

The material provided to your office indicates the Air Force's interest in UFOs and concludes there is no evidence that they represent interplanetary spaceships or anything that would indicate they are intelligently controlled vehicles.

Sincerely,
MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF Information
Public Information Division
