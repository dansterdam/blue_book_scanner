Objects Seen, Socorro - 1963
Near the 1966 spring UFO flap in western New Mexico, on the following Saturday morning, April 24, 1964, at about 5:50 p.m. on a summer night in 1963 (no exact date), Mr. and Mrs. John A. Kaplan watched three lights (objects) through their picture window on the east wall. The Kaplans and their three children observed the object as it moved slowly eastward. It brightened and dimmed alternately as it moved eastward, rose and cleared the mountains which, as it moved westward, rose again. They were not frightened and discontinued their observation about 10 p.m.

In about 10 minutes the object a Mrs. J. Cardwell observed the arc motion might account for the bright flach it corresponded to the movement.
