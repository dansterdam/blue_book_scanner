Dear Mrs. [name redacted],

Possibly by now you have been contacted by one or someone acting for the U.S. investigating the strange design or markings which you have been informed concerning the grass to be "used" as a species of grass fly.

It is rather unusual happening with an unusual answer and to our knowledge nothing such as this has been found or knowledge concerning things such as are frequently attributed to saucers.

Cordially,

C. R. HART
Major, USAF
Public Information Division

Mrs. [name redacted]
