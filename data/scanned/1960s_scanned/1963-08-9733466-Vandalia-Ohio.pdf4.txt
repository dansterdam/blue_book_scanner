This image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or form related to a UFO sighting report, likely part of Project Blue Book. The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or survey asking for details about the observed UFO, such as whether it disappeared while being watched, whether it moved behind something, and whether it moved in front of a cloud. There are also questions asking the observer to describe the object's sound, color, and size in relation to a known object.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, it disappeared eventually.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes. Don't know.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): (Yes) No. Don't know.
If you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound 
b. Color Brown

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and move it until the object of the match is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you observed, such as wings, partitions, or vapor trails. If the drawing is to show the direction the object was moving, please draw an arrow inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
