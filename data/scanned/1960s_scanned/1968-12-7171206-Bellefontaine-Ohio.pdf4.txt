APPENDIX I
I was heading east, object was heading east on county road 25, object was ahead a little bit to the left, front of car, could look through windshield, front, witness. I turned south on county road 9, object still going straight on ahead. When I passed a house, which was on left side of road, I noticed object was not going southerly direction, 'and I could see it with ease through left front door window.' When I turned onto state road 47 object also turned in direction I did toward Bellefontaine.
Object appeared not to make any precise 90 turns. When I got to Williams & Main St. the object took off quickly, straight up when I stopped. Coming to Bellefontaine I could see the object with ease through left front door window. I had stopped three times and object stopped at same time. Third time I stopped there weren't any buildings close by and slight wind. I rolled down window, thinking it might have been a reflection on window, but object still appeared high which humming sound. Object looked round and bluish-white in color. I couldn't tell size, appeared to be about 2 miles from car. At this time I was about one mile from state road 47. Sky was clear, I didn't see any clouds.
