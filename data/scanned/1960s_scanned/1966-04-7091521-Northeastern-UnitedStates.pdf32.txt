The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document with text describing the details of a UFO sighting.

Description of the vehicle was oval, looking much like the full moon, but brightly illuminated over its entire surface with a bluish-green color. It seems to have been at a considerable distance from the observer since we learned that those who made the first sightings from their closed window could not see detail. It is evident from the press release that the second sighting was observed by the exception.

I might also add that I have just completed four years as an Investigator in this project and had the opportunity to interview a large number of people who have witnessed unusual aerial phenomena. It is my feeling that proper channels for future reference.

Thank you.
Very truly
