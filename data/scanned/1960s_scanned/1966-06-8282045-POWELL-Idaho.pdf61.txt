There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, containing text describing various aspects of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
10th September 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
1. I believe that the type of objects that I have discovered are invisible to our naked eye and can only be seen or recorded through the film of a camera. These flying craft are genuine and can be heard by many people who saw them.
2. I believe that my discovery is entirely different from any other material objects which are now known to many people who saw them.
3. I believe these spaceships which are invisible, colorless, soundless and used by these super-intelligent beings who have landed or crashed in Idaho and for more accurate records are far more interesting than all stories about the flying saucers.
4. An ordinary flying machine is strictly recognized on the basis of their color, shape and light. These ships have no light or produce any sound even while walking on them.
5. Their occupants are in an extra-terrestrial state which one could not imagine from the human point of view. These beings are as unimaginable as the difference between a man and a dog.
6. Their spaceships are round and transparent tall shape covering and all transport will shape and are all invisible to the naked eye.
7. These crafts are difficult to approach on bright moonlit nights but also difficult to see on dark nights (K.I.A.).
8. Their walk on light rays usually pulsating lights of different colors may indicate life forms from higher intelligence. They have the precision of an electronic machine while critining in space.
