The image does not contain any photograph, it is only text. As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 200-2. Refer to
you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn in this
with your OD report in the morning.

One final note. Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-
sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more
tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same
are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the CAC,
493. Reports are much more easily investigated at the time of the
than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help
Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.
