7th July 1964
Capt. R. H. Henry
MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, 
Dear Capt. Henry:

As about 8 p.m. on the 4th of July, my husband and I saw what appeared to be a bright light in the northern sky. We were sitting on our patio watching the fireworks display when this light attracted our attention.

At first we thought it was another rocket going up but it seemed to hover and flash at intervals. It was at about 45 degree angle to the horizon and appeared to be approximately 4 or 5 miles away. The light seemed to be round or oval and was yellowish white in color. It remained stationary for about 15 to 20 minutes and then seemed to increase in brightness and then just disappeared.

We called several other people to observe this light and they verified that they also saw it. However, when my husband went to the telephone to call your office, the light went out. We have not been able to determine what this light was. It did not seem to be an aircraft, nor did it seem to be a satellite or a meteor. I hope this helps in some way to clear up the mystery.

Sincerely,

DRAWWATER, SEA. 33515
