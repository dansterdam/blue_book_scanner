Dear Ben:

Two friends of mine spotted an unusual occurrence 
while doing some astronomy the other evening.  

I thought if the Air Force is still keeping an
active check on UFO's, you might pass it on to whoever
handles that sort of thing.

Please let me know of any comment you may receive.

Regards
