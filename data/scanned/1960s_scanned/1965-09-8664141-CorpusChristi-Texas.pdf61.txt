Maherne Mystery
"From the Wairarapa News" of Wellington, New Zealand, reports the story of a "Maherne Mystery" in which a small boy with a plain white light-like a star" was seen drifting over Maherne. The light moved around over the hills and was watched for about 15 minutes by Mr. Coddery Tenney, it of Masterton. The boy was seen rising vertically and the light was still there when he disappeared. UNQUOTE.
