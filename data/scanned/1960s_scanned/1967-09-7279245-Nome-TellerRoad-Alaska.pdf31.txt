There does not appear to be any photograph on this page of the Project Blue Book document. The image shows a blank white page with the text "WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE HOLD A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE DOOR, AND THEN MEASURE HOW MUCH OF THIS OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. THIS WAS TO OBTAIN A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF THE OBJECT'S SIZE. USING THE KNOWN SIZE OF THE MATCH HEAD, PRESUMED DESCRIPTION WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD."
