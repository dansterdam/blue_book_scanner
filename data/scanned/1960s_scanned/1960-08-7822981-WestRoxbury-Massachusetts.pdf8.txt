UFO Sighting (Witness) 

APOI-3d (L/Col Tacker)

1. A resident of West Roxbury, Massachusetts reported an UFO sighting to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, which was referred to ATIC by the agency. 

2. A bright object was sighted at 2355, 29 August 1960, which was described as being round and glowing from the interior to the exterior. The object was further described as appearing like the head of a missile on fire. The observation took place at West Roxbury, Massachusetts. 

3. It is the ATIC conclusion that this was probably observed as a meteor. The sighting is not considered to provide any data which would be of significant technical value.

4. It is improbable that the flame seen was from a jet aircraft because this flame is consistently blue and should not be very bright from the JC vantage point enjoyed by the witness. 

5. The witness was interviewed by newspaper reporters about the sighting. He said the object he saw was just like the ones described in the newspapers as "flying saucers". He is of the opinion that these objects are probably high flying jet aircraft.

6. Suggest you inform Mr Hess of the ADIC conclusions. The address of the witness is:

West Roxbury, Massachusetts
