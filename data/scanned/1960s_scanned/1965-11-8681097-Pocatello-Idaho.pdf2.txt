Dear Mr. Harbert:
On the evening of November 8, 1965, I observed a peculiar light in the sky above Pocatello, Idaho. This light was observed from approximately 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM Mountain Standard Time. The light appeared to be situated at a considerable height and its approximate position was located almost directly overhead, and slightly to the east of my location. The light appeared luminescent or self-luminous, and remained fixed in position throughout the observation period. It did not appear to move or change position or brightness during the time it was under observation.
At times, the light appeared to be surrounded by a reddish-orange glow or halo, but this condition was not constant and the halo appeared and disappeared at irregular intervals. The light itself remained essentially constant in its overall luminosity and color during the entire period of observation.
Visibility conditions were excellent and the sky was clear. There was no cloud cover or haze present that could have obscured or distorted the appearance of the light. The light was easily visible to the naked eye, and did not require optical assistance to observe.
I am a professional engineer employed by the United States Geological Survey, and I am reasonably familiar with the appearance of natural and man-made celestial objects. This light did not conform to the appearance of any familiar celestial body or known aircraft. Its peculiar characteristics and fixed position in the sky lead me to the conclusion that the light was of an unidentified nature.
I would appreciate any information you may be able to provide regarding this observation. Please let me know if you require any additional details.
Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
Golightly
