Dear sir:

In the Lansing State Journal this evening I read an article about some unidentified objects that were observed near Lansing, Michigan. The report basically gives them described as a formation of lights, perhaps you would like to add this to your files.

We were living in the northern part of Chicago, Michigan, and the fall of 1964. It was late in the evening and all the leaves were off the trees. In the particular evening, it was very dark and the stars had already come out. 

I got out of the car and glanced up at the sky to see what the weather was going to be like, that night. As I was looking, a falling star came out of the stars. I watched it and soon realized it wasn't a meteor.

It was coming down terrible fast. I've never seen anything like it. It was also coming almost straight down because it seemed to be larger and larger as it came down. I am not very good at appraising just what I saw, but I can say it was about as high as a small plane when you see one.

Within just a few moments it had disappeared from sight. I then called my husband to come out and look. By the time he got out, whatever it was had completely disappeared. Needless to say, we were quite surprised and excited over what we had seen.
