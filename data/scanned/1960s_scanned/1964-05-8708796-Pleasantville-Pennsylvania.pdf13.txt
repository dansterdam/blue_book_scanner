There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing only text.

Here is the text from the document:

If altitude had phenomenal speed of Yellow-orange lights. Man: Keyhoe emphasis is when phased, and rockets. I assure you this observed was considered a lapsed. If altitude had phenomenal speed of Yellow-orange lights.

Thank you for your attention in this matter.

Kindest regards.
