Dear Sirs:
Enclosed are two copies of reports which I filed with NICAP. Aware of your official policy in regard to UFO sightings, however, I decided that your official policy and your frequently expressed stand to believe now and investigate later was no longer tenable. I feel that whatever contributions our sightings and observations may be of value to you and to our nation. I don't care to receive an agency from yours which would be damaging, accusatory, or whatever. I am sure the only kind ones of ridicule or some asinine attempt to explain them as weather balloons, radar reflections or what have you, are not the ones I was trained to serve. 
But the Air Force is busy talking about various aspects of UFO sightings such as designing the radar that has been seeing them for many years. I am serious.
The Air Force will eventually release factual information about them. Remember gentlemen, they virtually release much on what they know today because it can no longer be denied or by playing with technicalities.
My first report is in sequence to my report 1 sent 1957 when Kenneth Arnold spotted UFOs over the state of Washington. Up until about a year ago there was little or no science to substantiate their existence. Today the greatest authorities, the astronauts, the military, and the scientific world must admit they are a reality.
Airplane illusions, Balloons and celestial objects can no longer fool modern scientific equipment. Whatever they are, they are entities of real substance, material. In any event, they are enclosed and I hope they will be the occasion of world pattern of recognizing as many problems for solution as possible.
Sincerely,
