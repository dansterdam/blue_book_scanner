The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

Text extracted from the document:

IT WAS A DEFINITELY AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT AND IT JUST CAUGHT MY EYE. IT STARTLED ME.

IT FINALLY DISAPPEARED BY FLYING OFF AND DISAPPEARING IN THE NORTHWEST. 

SINCE IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT AND A TRUE FACT JUST FOR ABOUT 5-5 SECONDS.
