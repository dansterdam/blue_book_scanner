29. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path to show the start, and "B" at the end to show any changes in direction during the course.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
