This image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a form with various questions about a UFO sighting, but there does not appear to be any photograph included.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Gradually disappeared.

15. Did the object reappear? If so, how? 
(Circle One)   Yes   No   Don't know.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)   Yes   No   Don't know.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - No sound. 
b. Color - Bright light.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or a pen's length in line with a known object and note how many times the object being observed would fit into the length of the match or pen. (See the diagram.)
The match-stick size was 2 inches long and the object was 3 times that size.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects, label and include in your sketch any details of the object you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please use arrow's beside the details to indicate direction of movement.

[The handwritten text in this section is:] I could distinguish object, it was stationary, no exhaust, no wings, no protrusion, just a bright round light that gradually disappeared in the sky.
