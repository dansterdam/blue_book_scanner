There is a photograph present in this document. It appears to be an illustration or diagram related to a UFO sighting or report. The image shows a sketch with several compass-like markings and an object labeled "A" that appears to be moving across the sky.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass to show the direction where you last saw it.

28. Use a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
