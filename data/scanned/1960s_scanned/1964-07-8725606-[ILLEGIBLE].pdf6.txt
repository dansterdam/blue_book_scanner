Project Blue Book
December 29, 1964

Dear Sir:
I am 75 years old and my house is located north east of the coal mine of the town of Bates, Ohio. It is truly amazing that anything like this should happen. On July 14, 1964, at about 2:45 a.m. my attention was attracted by a brilliant light that appeared to be hovering over a wooded area about 1/2 mile from my house. The light was white in color and was flat according to our local pastor, who lives near me. They were flat on the top and bottom and roughly oblong in shape. I would estimate the size of this object as being about 30 ft. in diameter. There was no sound coming from it and I watched it for about 100 yds. and then it appeared to black away and disappear. Instead of two lights, there was only one. This was not any other aircraft that I am familiar with.
I know there are many unidentified flying objects in the sky. I have never seen anything like this before. It was a most unusual sight and I am still wondering what it really was. I can only say that I saw it with my own eyes and it was not an airplane or any other craft that I know of. I hope that this information will be of some help to you.

Sincerely,
[ILLEGIBLE]
