1. Reference the attached report of an unidentified flying object sighting. His observation on the night of 27 October 1965 was probably caused by the planet Venus which was in the process of setting. Venus had a high ascension of 3.9+ hours and 12 minutes and a stellar magnitude of -3.9. This disclosed the planet at 240 degrees azimuth.

2. The Air Force Museum is open to the public Monday through Friday from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Saturday and Sunday from 1 P.M. to 5 P.M.

3. The attached brochure will help explain the objectives and results of Project Blue Book to date. No physical evidence is known to exist which supports the contention that unidentified flying objects exist as interplanetary vehicles.
