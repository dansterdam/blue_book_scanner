NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
FOWLER 15 JULY 1965
SHERBORN, MASSACHUSETTS

SUBJECT: UFO Report - 15.30 July 1965 (Sherborn, Massachusetts)
DATE: 29 August 1965
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman, NICAP Massachusetts Subcommittee
TO: NICAP
cc: PROJECT BLUEBOOK

The following report provides information concerning the sighting of a UFO at Sherborn, Massachusetts on 15.36 July 1965 10:30 PM and 2:00 AM EDT by Marietta A. Abbott, a resident of Sherborn and a licensed airplane pilot.

This subcommittee is still in the process of evaluating over 40 UFO reports received from early in July to the date of writing. Several have been eliminated as Venus, a huge kite carrying a flare, the echo satellite and misidentification of an aircraft. Because of the volume of reports being received, detailed accounts and our evaluation will be slow coming to NICAP. The continuing "FLAP" as casually adding us "UFO-weary"?!?
