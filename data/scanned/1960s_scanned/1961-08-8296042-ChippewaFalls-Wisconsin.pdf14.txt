There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

"I would like you to know that your discovery has been noted and added to my files. 

My department has a keen interest in any phenomena associated with flying objects or strange appearances in the sky. 

Reports by citizens of this country are carefully studied by research groups in this field. Many intelligent and responsible people have seen the flying objects that have been reported over the past few years, and there is no doubt that some of these sightings have been the object of a planned program and vehicles of a mysterious nature. 

Returning your letter, which you wished me to retain, I suggest that you keep a careful record of any additional information of this nature that may come to your attention. Such data is valuable to the continuing study and evaluation of the subject.

Sincerely yours,"
