MOODY'S COMMENTS ON JULY 1-17 1963 SIGHTINGS

CASE
1. See what you can do with this one...... My "informer" indicates that don't usually move more than 15 deg per hour except while close to the horizon. The duration and brightness has been puzzling...as BRIGHT as a searchlight. The darkness between observations can render this more than one object. 
4. Another of those flashing strobes. At least this one was observed for an R/V, but what of the others?
Info Wilshire Crater Moser...
15. Dr Hynek has copies of the photos....

CASES WITH SIGNIFICANCE...
1. ALL UNIDENTIFIEDS are worth mentioning... Though I don't suspect this 1 
4. Might have been worth investigating... 
5. Flashing strobe with short duration...
15. All photo cases are included.....
