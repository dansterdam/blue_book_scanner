Dear Sir:

In reply to your letter of December 18, 1935, I wish to advise that on May 13, 1935, I made an investigation of the report of this type and found at that time the facts did not warrant any further action by this office.

My office is not recommending any further special investigating on the same incident.

Yours truly,
[Signature]
Mario F. Floriani
Chief of Police
