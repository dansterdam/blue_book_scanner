The image does not contain any photographs. The text in the document appears to be a report from Project Blue Book about a UFO sighting.

1. A star could be seen over a telephone pole. The exposure was about 5 minutes.
2. The blurry picture show the bottom of the photo and to the right of the object is trail.
3. The film is assumed to be a defect in the film.
It should be noted that while watching for these objects, meteors, satellites and aircraft, none of which acted like the reported phenomena.
It is my opinion that this report is as accurate as possible, and describe as well as possible what I observed.
Anyone desiring to speak to me or offer a explanation or comment on the phenomena herein described should contact: Glendale, California 91205
Photos will be forthcoming.
