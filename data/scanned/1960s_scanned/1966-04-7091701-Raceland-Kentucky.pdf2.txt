Raceland, Ky.
Dear Sirs:
On the night of April 7, 1966, at approximately 11:00 to 11:15 p.m., I was standing on my front porch facing North when I observed a brilliant light in the northern sky. The light appeared to be oval-shaped and was pulsating. At first it hovered in one spot, then it started slowly moving in an easterly direction. After moving a short distance the light suddenly sped up and took off at a tremendous rate of speed in a northeasterly direction, out of sight in a matter of a few seconds.
I watched the light for several minutes and it appeared to be about the size of a large star. I did not see any apparent structure, just a brilliant light that seemed to be pulsating. The night was clear and the stars were clearly visible. This object was not an airplane, satellite, shooting star, helicopter or any other known object I am familiar with.
I am a 30-year old male, have not had any alcoholic beverage, and have 20/20 vision. I am certain this was a strange and unidentified object in the sky. I believe it was some type of UFO and am reporting it to you in the hope that your organization may be able to explain or identify it.
Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Sincerely yours,
