There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document containing instructions and a blank space for a drawing.

Text from the document:
15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED. SUCH AS WINGS OR PROTRUDITIONS, AND INDICATE CLEARLY IN WHICH DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HELD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT OR BUILDING, AND ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED. THIS EXPERIMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
