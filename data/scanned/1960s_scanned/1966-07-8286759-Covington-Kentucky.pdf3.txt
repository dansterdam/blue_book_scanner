Q. Were in front of the school. (a bright red-shaped had been seen about 1/2 hour before). Some of the witnesses said this sighting could be or might be a weather balloon. They said to call the U.S. Weather Bureau. I called them and they said no balloons were released that night. I contacted Lt. Campbell, Ft. Knox, Ky and he said this was definitely not a weather balloon. It was then called Wright-Patterson A.F.B.
