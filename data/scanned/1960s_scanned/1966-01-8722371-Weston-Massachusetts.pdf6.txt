There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a typed or handwritten document page from a UFO report.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"The log indicates that it would probably continue for some particular duration of problem for approximately two or three seconds. Maybe even longer than that.

This - as I said before we started recording the air -  data, indicates that the witnesses in question were able to see this phenomenon very well, and not at a distance or anything. 

That's right.

Well, that certainly establishes that. And you were standing still.

Yes, right.

(Break in tape.)

All right. When, how long did it stay in that hovering, varying, meandering position?

Somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes. I didn't actually time it.

That's interesting -- that longer - just before it started to move, did it give any indication that it was going to move, so to speak? or anything like that?

No, I didn't observe any change in color, intensity -- the object appeared to be steady as far as I'm concerned.

When we talked about it before, you said something about it being kind of radioactive kind of thing. Can you go into that a little more?

I don't know why I said that except that the source was ex-treme so a kind of artificial means such as a laser, or any known types of lamp.

How would it compare with a short circuit in an electrical wire, when you have the wires exposed and sparking in an dim storm?

There would be some similarity there except for the fluctuations of the color.

The central light was much more steady than one would expect in something like that.

Yes the function also suggest - this doesn't seem to be one that I want to go into, except that it is not a function of the way I'm handling through the answer."
