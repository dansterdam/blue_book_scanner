Dear Hector:

Thank you for your letter of 1 July and its enclosure. I have read it carefully and I am pleased to enclose a report on the sighting of a bright light in the vicinity of the moon; a meeting of a committee of which I am a member. 

I found the case you sent extremely interesting. I am particularly pleased with your estimate of the percentage of such events as this that can be explained. My only minor comment is that I would have replaced the word "possibly" by "probably". 

I see no reason to get excited over the Kansas City sighting. Such apparitions are well known and are usually explained. The gas bag hot air balloon, if such it was, is probably the suggestion. The description sounds to me much more like the planet Venus - even to the flashing and irregularity, which I have often noticed.

I think that the failure of the Air Force to record anything like radar observations or photographs of these "flying saucers" is strong evidence that they do not exist. Planes or meteors or all sorts of quite natural phenomena might produce a duplicate of what the witnesses saw, and again I think it likely that a good many of the sightings are either hoaxes or are truly insignificant celestial events.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature]
