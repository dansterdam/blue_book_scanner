Dear Major Jacks,

Could you please send me the Fact sheet, "Project Blue Book" and a AFR 200-2 (Sept. 14, 1959)?

Also, could you also send me any other information on the organization of UFOS? I am especially interested in any information you could send on the upcoming New Mexico landing of April 24, 1954.

I would also appreciate it if you could send us some Technical Information Sheets (Form FTD-LC-Ost 62).

And would you please send me a copy of Special Report 14 (May 5, 1955).

Yours truly,
Gary R. Pinnell
Director, SIR
