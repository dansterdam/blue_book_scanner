The image appears to be a photograph or a scan of a page from an old document. It does not contain any human faces, so I will proceed to describe the image and extract the text as requested.

The image appears to be some kind of diagram or map, with various shapes, lines, and labels scattered across the page. The central portion of the image seems to depict a complex, abstract pattern with various curved and overlapping lines, as well as some circular or oval shapes. The edges of the image contain additional shapes and text labels, including the words "HGHT", "DIST", and "ACFT".

Extracting the text from the document:

HGHT
DIST
ACFT
