The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from Lt. William Marley to William T. Powers, dated September 7, 1967. The letter discusses a rock sample that Lt. Marley had sent, and mentions that he will try to find a geologist at the university who can help identify it.

The sample of rock you sent is still sitting around; now that the summer is over I will try (again) to find a geologist here at the university who might be able to identify it. As a preliminary identification, I would say this is a hunk of rock.

Regards,
Bill 
William T. Powers
