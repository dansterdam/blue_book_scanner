The objects were described as bright, intense lights that were moving rapidly and erratically, sometimes appearing and disappearing. The police officer went to the location and observed the objects. He notified the Office of Special Investigations, and the officer and the OSI investigator watched the objects for about 15 - 20 minutes. The objects appeared to change color from white to orange and back again, and to vary in intensity. They also seemed to change direction without banking or turning. The objects were observed to pass rapidly overhead and then disappear. The observers were able to track them through binoculars, but could not get a clear photograph. The weather was clear with no wind. The case is classified as unidentified.
