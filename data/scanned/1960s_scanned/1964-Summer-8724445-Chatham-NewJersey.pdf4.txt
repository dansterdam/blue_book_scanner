To Whom It May Concern:

My name is [redacted]. I'm 15 years old and live at [redacted], Chatham, New Jersey.

Last summer, 1964, I saw a sight in the sky. It wasn't flying saucers and the U.S. Air Force, Lawrence J. Tacker, told me that I didn't imagine it.  

It was about 9:30 and I were outside talking. I notice something in the sky and I were talking real fast. I was talking and I were told to hush.

I saw that it weren't no plane or satellite and I were talking about it and have been trained to look up when I notice things like that.
