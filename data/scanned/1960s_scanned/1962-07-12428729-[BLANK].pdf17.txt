"it is impossible to have good documented reports on ball lightning. In most of these cases, interference with vehicle ignition, lights, radio, etc. Such interference, if actually occurring, could be due to the presence of the ball lightning or to the fact that the witness in his excitement may accidentally stall the car. Because ball lightning usually occurs immediately following a severe thunder storm, such factors as wet ignition, atmospheric static, etc. may be the cause for the reported trouble.

The Air Force has taken radar counter readings immediately after sightings but has yet to find any readings which vary significantly from the normal background of noise tested.

Radar sightings are often supported by "usual sightings" because the same atmospheric conditions which permit visual anomalies may also affect radar.

It is Air Force policy to provide what data is available with information regarding UFO sightings which much is released to the public in response to their specific requests. Further, the new edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica will carry an article on unidentified flying objects. This article, approved by the Air Force, was prepared by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Chairman of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern University, who has served as Air Force consultant to the UFO program since 1948.

In order that the public be provided with as much information as possible, every effort is made to keep UFO sightings unclassified."
