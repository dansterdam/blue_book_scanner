Dear Sir:

On August 27, 1959, at about 10:15 p.m., three of us were approaching East Lake Road on Woodland Road
near Skaneatales, N.Y. We observed a bright flash near the horizon. It was a bright round flash, similar to a flash of lightning, but somewhat larger and brighter. Three of us were approaching East Lake Road on Woodland Road. We observed a bright flash near the horizon. It was a bright round flash, similar to a flash of lightning, but somewhat larger and brighter.

About fifteen seconds later we saw a second flash. This flash was to the left of the first flash and appeared to be lower on the horizon. The second flash was not as bright as the first one. 

Looking back, the flash seemed to illuminiate the sky for a short time, and then it disappeared. We discussed the flashes for some time, and we all agreed that they were unusual phenomena. It was too bright, in our opinion, to be a beacon or some other normal light source.

We would appreciate any explanation you can give us regarding the flashes we observed. If we can be of any other assistance, please let us know.

Yours truly,
Thomas Owen
