The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing a UFO sighting reported by Airman Isley.

The text from the document is as follows:

Airman Isley stated that he observed the object from 0230 to 0430, for 2 hours. It was seen south of his position, first being seen in the west and disappearing in the southeast. The lights looked like the lights of a jet aircraft and it came within 4 miles of his location twice. The sound was that of jet engines. During the period of observation it went out of sight 3 to 4 times and then reappeared. At one time he sighted two objects. Also sighted B-52 on its first pass.

AIC O'Connors, who was with Airman Isley, stated that he saw the UFO from 0230 to 0335 hours. (He explanation for conflict in duration.) The light was seen moving in various directions in the southern skies. The object appeared to be a self-luminous reddish-white ball of white light that seemed to change to a green light, then later to a dull amber color. A noise similar to that of a jet aircraft. A light on the object was caused to blink out as the sighting and the object did not appear again after the B-52 made its first pass (22 miles pass at about 0335 hours).

AIC Jabunoaki, who was dispatched by 896th Bomb to November 1 with Airman Isley and AIC O'Connors, reported that he sighted the object for two hours off and on. The object was self luminous with glowing orange-red, white, and greenish alternating and at times.
