There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document with text that appears to be part of a UFO report or investigation.

My OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

"My mother spotted the dome one night early in the evening. Time approx 10:30 p.m. Please send me a letter on your official conclusion. I am well for the information I seem to lack."
