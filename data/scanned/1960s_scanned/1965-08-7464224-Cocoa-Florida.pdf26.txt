No, I just have the man and wife there on that corner, and I live with another stopped in a car and they saw it. I have no idea who they are. This is very interesting, of course, and I could tell much but in examining a number of these cases around that time, I am trying to find out whether the same sort of things were seen you see in different parts of the country. Actually, this all seemed to start on July 31st, and there were sightings - a lot of reports on August 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then by August 5 it pretty much backed down. But during those few nights there were an awful lot of reports even from some sae bases out west. And this is why this was the night that they did have a shot at the Cape, and now on this was a night shot they were having then. We are having a shot Saturday, but of course, that's going to be a daylight shot.

I don't know whether that has anything to do with it - I don't think. I thought at first that it was something from the Cape - I mean, some kind of system that they might have put in the air, you know. Yes. Let me ask this: - a thing I have frequently asked people. If you had some extra means way up in the sky that would most closely resemble what you saw, what object or objects would you pick? to put up there that would look something like this? This to me looked like the end of a flare? Do you know what type of flare I mean? The flare that's used in the railroad? Yes, the railroad type flare. This is how it looked if you were looking directly at the flame. This is the way it would look. Not the lousitation, just the flame.
