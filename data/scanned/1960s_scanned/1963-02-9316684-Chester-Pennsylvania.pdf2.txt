Feb 7, 1963

A woman, wife of a U.F.O. spotter, came to Chester, Pa., on Feb. 6th, at 2:43 P.M. and observed the usual lights and sound of a U.F.O. for some 13 minutes before it left the area. It was silent and went straight up. It seemed to be stationary and was first seen in the north western sky and went into the north eastern sky. The object was not an airplane or a meteorite according to the witness.
