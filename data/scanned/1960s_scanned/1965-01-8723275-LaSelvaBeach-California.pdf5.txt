NEW REPORTS FROM CALIFORNIA: As reported in our un-scheduled Journal Newsletter #29, February 21st reports, the Air Force has claimed that the alleged UFO sighting in the La Selva Beach area on February 14th was explained as the Coast Guard having spotted flashing lights on a helicopter. However, the civilian witnesses to the incident have refuted this claim. They insist that the object they saw was not a helicopter, but rather a strange craft that appeared to be transferring through a "light shaft" in the sky. The witnesses also told us that they have been here before, and many of them claim to have seen similar craft on previous occasions. The Air Force has asked us not to discuss the incident in detail, as they claim the report of the incident is still under investigation. However, we still have no report on what conclusions, if any, the Air Force has reached regarding this incident.
