The image contains no photograph, only sketches and text. The text in the image is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. This would be difficult to sketch as the objects moved in so many directions.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Two. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling. This again would be difficult to sketch due to the length of time observed and various positions that when first sighted they were positioned as follows:

I believe the higher object was the one we kept in sight the longest.
