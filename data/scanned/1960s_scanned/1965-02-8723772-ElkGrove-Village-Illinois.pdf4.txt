Dear Major:

Sighting, Elk Grove Village, Ill. February 5, 1965

This is an account of the NBC "Documentary on UFO's" treatment of the Elk Grove Village case. I was present throughout the entire interviewing and filming, although I did not take part in it. The witness was a woman who is a physicist of about 26 and reasonably well self-possessed. Her story follows and then I'll give a few details.

She was coming home by herself at about midnight, February 5, 1965. (She) was coming from a doctor's appointment, who does not make late appointments for people who sitters come earlier. She lives on Emery Lane and as she was carrying around toward her house some four doors across the street, she encountered this object in the sky. It appeared to be at bearing to be 275-280 degrees magnetic. She stopped her car and got out. Although said object, she pointed out that it was nothing more than two inter-connecting ovals of light - a dazzling light, understandably foggy, without definite shape. There were no red, green or white lights, no vapor trails, merely the two ovals of light burning the night sky. However it was moving at amazing speed, and was lost to sight beyond the horizon in many seconds. She said she was "terrified to some degree - the object might adversely affect her car and her person". She hurried over the icy sidewalk to the left of her house; overcome the lights of her car; and was positive that the light was directly overhead. She said there was a space of about fifty or sixty feet long and same width about twenty or thirty feet above the house. The house is fifty feet long and the object was about twenty or thirty feet above it. Nevertheless whenever she drew the light, she shut the drape - she said she was afraid to look at it.

She said she stood at the back of her house transfixed at this sight, but not all frightened - there was no sound and then directed into the house, which she could have from where she was standing, fumbled with her keys, got in, ran to the window, but the object was gone. She then drew the drape - she was afraid to look at it.
