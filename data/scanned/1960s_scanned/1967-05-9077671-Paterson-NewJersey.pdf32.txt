Carod on may the sano as before exept that I was able to follow the object that appeared to be hovering when it moved. It moved slow at first when I got outside then it moved toward the north at a faster rate. It seemed solid and did not appear to be lights on the object but a single source of bright light. Also when it moved it did not appear to be rotating or tumbling. I had a clear view of it for 2 to 3 minutes when it disappeared from my sight. I have no idea where the object went after that. I then went inside and the object was not visible anymore. I searched for it for a few minutes but have not seen it again.
