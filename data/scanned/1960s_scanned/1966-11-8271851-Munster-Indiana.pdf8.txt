If a strange objet by appearing, it appeared as a V shaped object of about 40 to 50 feet across but only 12 to 14 feet in height, and very luminous. It came from overhead and was first noticed about 3/4 to 1 mile away, moving at a slow speed. As it drew nearer, the object at the head of the V seemed to emit a beam, or a shaft of light or something, which was very bright and directed at one small area on the ground. This beam or shaft of light seemed about 12 to 15 feet long. At this distance the object looked to be about the size of a car, but much thicker. No sound was heard. The object slowed down and hovered for a few seconds, then picked up speed and went straight up out of sight. I could not estimate the altitude as it climbed straight up but it must have been at least 2 to 3 thousand feet when it disappeared. The whole sighting lasted from 2 to 3 minutes.
I really consider this one of the most interesting UFO sightings we have ever had in this area. The object made no noise, hovered, and then went straight up out of sight. I am quite sure this was no known aircraft, satellite or other conventional object. The beam of light was an especially interesting feature. After the object disappeared, I noticed that the vegetation under the beam area seemed to be pressed down or flattened, as if it had been subject to some force. I checked this area the next day and the vegetation did seem to be pressed down or flattened.
