UFO Observations

JUL 28 1955
Re: REPORT: SAMPLING (Mrs Riggs)
CASE D C 20250

1. Reference the attached letter from the Agency requesting information on their ____ observations of 13 July 1955.

2. The objects which they observed on the nights of 13 and 15 July 1955 are described to characteristics or activities which indicate they were stars or other lights in the sky.

3. The objects that were described as like stars are the only real intelligen on which we have information. There
are, however, over 10,000 satellite or satelloids visible to the unaided eye. From our observation, over 5,000 II. can be observed on any clear night. Therefore, the objects described were in all probability, stars or other natural phenomena rather than an identified or from mass.
