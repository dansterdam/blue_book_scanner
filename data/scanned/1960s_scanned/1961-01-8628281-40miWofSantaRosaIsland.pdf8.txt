LOS ANGELES -- JAN 7, CUPS-57 BEGAN CALMLY ENOUGH. LAST NIGHT A FIERY TRAIL AND A LARGE METEOR FLASHED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IT TOUCHED OFF REPORTS THAT AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT HAD BEEN SIGHTED IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN WEST OF SANTA ROSA ISLAND.

THE REPORT ENDED. THERE WERE REPORTS THAT FIRES WERE STARTED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FROM FALLING DEBRIS, BUT PARKS WERE RAINING PIECES OF METAL AND PLASTIC, ACCORDING TO EARLY REPORTS. HOWEVER, THE REPORTS WERE FAIRLY QUICKLY PROVEN FALSE EXCEPT FOR THE FIERY TRAIL AND METEOR FLASH WHICH WAS OFFICIALLY OBSERVED AND CONFIRMED.

THEN NUMEROUS REPORTS OF LIGHTS OVER SANTA ROSA ISLAND AND UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS IN THE SKY BEGAN POURING IN. APPARENTLY SEVERAL OBSERVERS NEAR LOMPOC SAW STRANGE LIGHTS AND OBJECTS IN THE SKY WHICH WERE NOT OFFICIALLY EXPLAINED. DETAILS ON THIS IS LACKING, BUT APPARENTLY THESE REPORTS SWELLED AND WERE REPEATED BY A VARIETY OF OBSERVERS BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY. THIS APPARENTLY STARTED THE RUMORS THAT WERE SOON CONTROLLED BURNING OF WEEDS THAT WERE MISTAKEN FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

THE ONLY INDICATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED SEEMS TO BE THAT THE REPORTS WERE TAKEN SERIOUSLY ENOUGH BY AIR FORCE OFFICIALS FROM HAMILTON AIR FORCE BASE TO WARRANT AN AIR SEARCH OVER THE AREA. HOWEVER, NOTHING FURTHER WAS DISCOVERED OR REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS SEARCH. THOSE ARE THE BASIC FACTS AS FAR AS AVAILABLE FROM OFFICIAL RUMORS. IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SEEN OVER SANTA ROSA ISLAND AREA WHICH STARTED SOME SPECULATION, OFFICIAL INTEREST AND INVESTIGATION, BUT NO FIRM CONCLUSIONS.
