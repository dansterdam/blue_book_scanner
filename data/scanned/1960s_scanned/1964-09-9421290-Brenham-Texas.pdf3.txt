Light,

If you have an explanation please let me know. The things that are experienced during these lights may at times seem strange but excuse me may go into theory. Theories are made to be tested and if found inaccurate should be dropped. The explosion of stars is caused by the expansions or contraction of gases. The light must travel through space and matter but we know that light enters the atmosphere is absorbed and refracted. Some of it the earth and some reflected into space. If this light, whatever it may be, goes through anything (the matter ray) and that you can see it, may the reflection here of a portion of ray. There is one of my profession and that is to give you the facts without bias. May the whole please let me know. Please let me know any information that can help.

Sincerely,
