On the night of January 12, 1968, two observers in Dayton, Ohio, reported seeing a bright light in the sky. The light was described as being larger than a star and moving at a high rate of speed. The observers tried to follow the light but lost sight of it after a short time.

The report goes on to describe the witnesses' observations in detail, including the movement and size of the light. It also mentions that the observers contacted the local authorities to report the sighting.
