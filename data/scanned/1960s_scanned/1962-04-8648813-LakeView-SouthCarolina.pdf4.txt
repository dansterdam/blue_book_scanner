Central Intelligence Agency
Washington 25, D.C.

20 APR 1962

Mr. Lake View
South Carolina

Dear Mr. Lake View,

Thank you very much for your letter describing your sighting of an object in the sky on 2 April 1962. This Agency is interested in these events; however, the United States Air Force is responsible for identifying all such objects in carrying out their defense activities. We therefore have forwarded your letter to the Air Force for appropriate action.

Very truly yours,

Philip G. Strong
Deputy Assistant Director
