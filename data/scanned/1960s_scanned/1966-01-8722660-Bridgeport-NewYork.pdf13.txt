The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report form. 

The text from the form is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Gradual zoom out became smaller, then faded

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one): Yes, No, Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.
(Circle one): Yes, No, Don't Know. 

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one): Yes, No, Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.
(Circle one): Yes, No, Don't Know.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color Reddish-orange, very bright

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil, length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. This will give us an estimate of the size of the object at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
1 inch match head covered approximately 1/3 of the object

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
