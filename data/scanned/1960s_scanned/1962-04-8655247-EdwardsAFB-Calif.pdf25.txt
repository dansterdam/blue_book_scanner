BID LET TO DEVELOP 
WEATHER-SAFE SYSTEM
The Aerospace Vehicle Control Division of the Air Force Systems Command is developing a compact air traffic control system that will permit aircraft to land safely regardless of weather conditions.
Under the direction of Major Phillip C. Gerber, the Division is spearheading a three-year project to add automatic landing gear to the STOL (short take-off and landing) aircraft being developed for the Air Force. 
The system will allow pilots to land their planes automatically with a 20-foot visibility ceiling, bringing a new era of all-weather flight to the Air Force.
Dyna-Soar
The X-20 Dyna-Soar, the Air Force's manned spacecraft, will be able to carry 3,000 pounds of non-military equipment to altitudes of 300 miles along a 17,500 mile-per-hour trajectory.
The X-20 is being developed by Aeronautical Systems Division for the Air Force. Current plans are for the X-20 to make its first un-manned flight from Cape Kennedy in 1963, with the first manned flight coming in 1964.
The X-20 is being developed as a research vehicle, designed to test systems that will be used later in the development of an Air Force manned space system. The basic X-20 design is being used as the basis for a new vehicle being developed by Aeronautical Systems Division.

New Name
Aerospace Medical Division's School of Aerospace Medicine recently changed its name to School of Aerospace Medicine, effective July 1. Location of the school is un-changed--Brooks AFB, Texas.

Serial Numbers
A new system of serially numbering personnel, equipment, and supplies of the Air Force is being developed. This system will provide a means of easily identifying equipment, supplies, and members of the armed forces. Under the new system, each piece of equipment and supply item will have a serial number, and each individual will have a serial number and a service number. Supplies and equipment will be more easily controlled, and personnel records easily traced.
Self Defense
Students now enrolled in the Squadron Officer School at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, are receiving a new course in self-defense. The course, called the Colt Self-Defense course, was introduced to the class which started last month. Training includes judo, karate, and other methods of self-defense.

Silver Wings
To act as an incentive for career advancement, a total of 59 cadets training through the Air Force ROTC program at colleges and universities have been awarded the silver wings of a pilot. Awarded to those AFROTC cadets who complete the pilot training course and qualify for their wings, this program is part of the Air Force's plan to bring the best qualified personnel into the air force.

Face-Lifting To Add
Radar Tracking Power
The Air Proving Ground Center will build a major addition to the APGC radar tracking range near Pensacola, Florida, it was recently announced. To be constructed at a cost of $2.6 million, the new facilities will provide an electronic "face-lifting" to the already-extensive radar tracking range.
Among the new additions will be a peak power capability of 2.5 megawatts and the installation of electronically-steerable, phased-array radars. These super-radars will enable the testing and evaluation of the latest air-to-air and air-to-ground guided missile systems under operational conditions.

Help Wanted
The U.S. Civil Service Commission is advertising for research scientists, engineers and others with advanced degrees in physical and biological sciences. Scientific, research and development positions at grades GS-11 and above are open.
"Should have a second look before saying they can't be interested," is the advice of one official who points out that the government is looking for the best scientific and technical talent available.

First Farmers
The Aar Force is recruiting for the following fields: Administration, Finance, Maintenance, Supply and Transportation. These are among the many career fields available as First Termers in the Air Force today.
