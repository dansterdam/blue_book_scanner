His head was huge, was possibly due to the fact that looking through a telescope. The white appearance was so because high powered telescope influenced the emotions through.

Have never received such an emotional reaction. Getting a mental picture of a man with a huge head. No facial features. down through high power telescope. Color was white because of emotion reaction (I pick this up easily) was very amused. Could grin like card player with an ace up his sleeve. Grin came through and I have had from various people even when I am not looking. After the craft light off the reaction just vanished.

His reaction received.
