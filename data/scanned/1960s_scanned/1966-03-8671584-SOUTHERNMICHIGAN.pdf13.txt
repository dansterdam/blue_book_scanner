Text from the document:

"Scientists at the University night club in Ann Arbor, Michigan, recently discussed observations they have made of unexplained phenomena appearing in the sky. They pointed out that the very nature of these phenomena suggests a carrier of some kind which could account for the unusual movements and disappearance and reappearance of the objects observed.

Professor William J. Bielemann of the astronomy department, University of Michigan, indicated that there is a distinct possibility that these objects observed could be instrumental in the electrostatic and gravitational forces operating in the upper atmosphere, which could provide the explanation for some UFO sightings.

Prof. George W. Prokopovitch, another University of Michigan scientist, indicated the UFO problem may be tied to the existence of a possible low-energy plasma phenomena known as "will-o'-the-wisps," which is a physical phenomenon similar to the will-o'-the-wisps produced by certain gases given off by decaying vegetation and which plays along the horizon reflecting the magnetism and gravitation of the atmosphere."
