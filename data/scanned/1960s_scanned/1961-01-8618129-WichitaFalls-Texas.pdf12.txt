UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Wichita Falls, Texas
Date (Local): 10 Jan 65
Hour (Local): 2215
Hour (Z Time Group): 0215
Satellite: (Det 5 ATIC, Ext 3279)
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): STELLAR OBJECT
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-AEI): N/G
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc): ___ 
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc: ___ 
Other: ___ 
Evaluation of Source Reliability: REASONABLE
Analysis and Conclusions: The OBJECT was observed approximately 35-45 degrees elevation in a low position in the WNW sky. The object appeared larger than a star, oval in shape, and bluish-white in color. The object made no sound and appeared to be gradually moving slightly upward. The estimated distance to the object was about 45-60 miles. This was based upon its apparent size and the fact that Stars in about that direction and elevation were dimly visible. Apparently the observation was of a stellar object, possibly a planet or comet, and was not of a closer, artificial object.
