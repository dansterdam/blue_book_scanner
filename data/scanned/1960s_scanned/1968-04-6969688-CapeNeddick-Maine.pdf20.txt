Dear Sirs:

Reference your letter May 16 1963 regarding if our aircraft was flying that night on April 12 1963.

Checking our records we indicate that first flight this year was conducted with the night equipment in night time May 14 1963. May I say again this was our first flight this season. There is no way our aircraft could create the sighting on April 12 1963. Gladly to help your organization.

Sincerely
