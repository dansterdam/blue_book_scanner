The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a diagram and instructions related to reporting UFO sightings. The diagram appears to be a sketch showing the horizon and angles at which an unidentified object was observed.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
