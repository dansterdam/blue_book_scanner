1. Reference your letter of December 29, 1966 regarding unidentified flying oi̥̇ects sighted in the Indianapolis, Indiana area.

2. In regards to your August 1966 observation, the late date in project files indicates the observation probably remains a comprehensive investigation. However, this delay is not unusual, and record-keeping procedures are not as rapid as that far in the past. Normally such records are kept for several months and then discarded of, since there are no longer current.

3. Please complete the attached TD-D-Forn 164 on your 12 November 1966 observation and we will try to identify the stimulus which caused your sighting. 

4. Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.
