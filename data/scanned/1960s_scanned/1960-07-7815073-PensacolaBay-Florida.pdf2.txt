MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD:

An attempt was made to recover the object that was reported to have fallen into Pensacola Bay on 15 July 1960. Due to the type of bottom, the presence of debris, and a shortage of funds, the recovery attempt was abandoned. The object observed was probably a large meterorite that failed to burn up in the earth's atmosphere, or possibly a part of an artificial earth satellite. However, due to the apparent size of the object, it was more probably a meteorite.
