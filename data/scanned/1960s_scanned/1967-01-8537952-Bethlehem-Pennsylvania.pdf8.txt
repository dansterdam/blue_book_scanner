Dear Sir:

On the night of January 7, 1967
I was out studying weather conditions and
for I got an amateur astronomer. The moon
was just about full on the night of the
the sighting. I went up to the moon and
I saw this object above and to the right
of the moon. I quickly ran inside and got
my telescope and opened the shutter and
plotted before it went away, seeing an
amateur astronomer you can not give me the
explanation that it was a star or planet.
The planet Jupiter was in the east, Mars
was in the south and Venus was in the
west. Please send me an explanation.

Sincerely,
