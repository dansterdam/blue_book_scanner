The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book. The page contains handwritten text and a postage stamp.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

U. S. O. ADVISORY 
Right Grasher A. F.B.
