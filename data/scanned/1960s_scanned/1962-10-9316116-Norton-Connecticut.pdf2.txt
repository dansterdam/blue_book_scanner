Dear Sir,
This evening at 7:44 E.S.T. I was watching satel- lites (echo 1) transit at about 35° altitude South, where I looked like a typical sputnik but suddenly fading - going S.E. from about 45° altitude (about dec. 5, 1962 5
mediately put my 7X50 binoculars on it and followed it for seconds when it went behind a tree in the S.E. at an atti- out 20° (about dec. 1962 5 
I could discern no color with the binoculars but it appeared s band about 0.1° wide and 0.5° long, brightest in the center and fading toward the ends. The length of the band was in the line of flight.
The sky was very clear. It did not have any similar to what I sighted before - and as I mentioned before, the bands did not detect any change in intensity.
Was this reported to you by any other observer? Cas what it was?
if this letter is improperly addressed, will you pleas
Sincerely yours,
