Proposed reply to letter from July 28, 1967 (Sighting 1966)

Dear Miss [Redacted],

Reference your letter in which you reported your unidentified observation of June or July 1966. With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essentials data such as maneuvers, flight characteristics, and duration of sighting are quite important to comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation to your nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data.

The enclosed information on Project Blue Book may be of interest to you. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
