The text in the document reads:

Dear Jim,

While travel on U.S. Route 70 on Friday, May 20, 1966 at about 10:30 P.M. I saw two unusual bright lights over Richmond.

Indicating, I showed one of the lights to my wife, and they were not there long -- the lights seemed to disappear quite rapidly. The lights appeared to be very high and distant, and on a direct course toward the east.

'52 was close and light which may have been aircraft, could be explained away as to the origin of the lights I saw.

There are a few of the facts about the flight which I have witnessed, and I understand and verify the action.
