II. Unusual Activity: Observer was quite near a border of a jet stream at 33,000 ft.
I. None
J. None in local area at this time.
K. Mr. B. Tyrell: Lr. Lt. USAF, 3713th Def Sys Eval Sq would have possibly seen a balloon of a "pillow" shape although none were reported released in local area. The apparent repports could be caused by the angular movement of a close distance of the formation of high stratus clouds. The observer appears when the angle of reflection from the sun changed, so as not to reflect observer. The observer reports the return of negative and a final report of observation, if available.
