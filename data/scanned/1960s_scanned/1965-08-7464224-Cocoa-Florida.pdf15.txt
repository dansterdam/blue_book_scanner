The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or transcript describing an observation of unusual celestial objects or phenomena.

Roughly speaking, - and this is rather important - was it directly west, or a little to the north of west or south of west, or how?
M: It was northwest.
H: Northwest. And about how far up from the horizon - half-way, quarter-way toward the top?  You know, how far up would you have to stretch your arm?
M: Three-quarters of the way.
H: Three-quarters. So it was pretty high.
M: Yes, it was.
H: Yes, as you see, - then this thing, the Air Force always tried to say, was a star. Well, your own mind, how did that light differ from a bright star?
M: It seems to me that a star stays bright and makes twinkles just a little bit. But that object was casting off the different lights.
I could definitely distinguish - it would be white, and then the greenish tint, and then the orange. And then it would go back to white, and then orange. You know.
H: And there were stars near that were not doing that?
M: That's right.
H: And how much brighter xxxxxxxxxxxxxbrighterxx than the brightest stars were xxxxxxx around it were would you say twice as bright, much brighter, or what?
M: When it was white, I think it was a little bright.
H: A little brighter than a star. Yes. The diamond formation itself didn't move?
M: It didn't seem to. But he said he noticed one move away from the formation and then back again (for 2 seconds). And that's what I saw.
