The image contains two sketches. The larger one is a compass rose diagram with labeled directions and instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction of a UFO sighting. The smaller sketches on the right appear to show a person standing in a landscape, with one sketch showing a more distant view.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHICH FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTIONS TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE PATH AND DIRECTION OF FLIGHT OF THE PHENOMENON. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS LATER SKETCH.
