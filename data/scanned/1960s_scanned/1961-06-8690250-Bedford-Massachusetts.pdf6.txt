The text in the document is as follows:

"This morning I looked out the kitchen window and saw an object. This object was stationary at first but it then started to move very rapidly in a northerly direction. It was silvery in color and shaped like a saucer. The brilliance of the object was so great that I can't compare it to anything I've ever seen before. It seemed to be about 100 to 150 feet in diameter. If I estimate accurately, it was about 1500 to 2000 feet in the air. The object then seemed to gather tremendous speed and disappeared in a matter of seconds. The whole observation took only 2 to 3 minutes. I'm convinced that this was no conventional aircraft. I might have been more interested in pursuing this matter further, but I thought it best not to say anything to anyone about it and just let it pass. I'm sure you understand how I feel about this."
