THE WILTSHIRE CRATER MYSTERY
The meteorite that never was
JULY 16, 1963, will long be remembered in British UFOlogy. It brought the sudden discovery of a large crater into a field at Wylye, Wiltshire. Immediately, the crater became the subject of widespread comment and speculation as to the cause of its sudden appearance.
Something appeared to have crashed, or landed, and left a deep conical depression in the ground approximately 40 feet across and several feet deep. Many examined the crater, and all were impressed with its size and the fact that it seemed to have been formed abruptly. Mrs. Waverley Girvan, who owns the farm on which the crater is situate, stated that she first noticed it on July 11, and a local schoolboy, Robin Westmead, claimed that he had seen strange lights in the area on the previous night.
From this point on the mystery deepened. Theories abounded as to the cause, some quite wildly speculative. Some thought it had been caused by a meteorite, others by a crashed unidentified flying object, known in the parlance of UFOlogy as a U.F.O. The press were attracted by the story, and for some days the Wiltshire crater was the subject of much attention and speculation, both in public and behind the scenes in official circles.
But something appeared to have happened which was to prove very puzzling. The crater was examined by representatives of the Ministry of Aviation, the Meteorological Office and others. They concluded that the crater could not have been caused by the impact of a meteorite. This view was reinforced by the absence of any fragments of a meteorite that could have been expected had a body of that nature hit the ground at such force.
The Ministry of Aviation representatives suggested that the cause of the crater might have been the collapse of a void in the underlying chalk. This was supported by the fact that the crater had been formed in an area of chalk subsoil. But even this theory did not quite tally with the suddenness and apparent violence with which the crater had appeared.
And now the mystery deepens still further. A few days later, the Wiltshire crater seemed to have disappeared! It was no longer there. Mrs. Girvan re-examined the site and could find no trace of it. This was confirmed by others who had seen the original crater. The deep conical depression had simply vanished, as if it had never existed.
So what was the Wiltshire Crater Mystery all about? Was it a real, physical phenomenon, or a hoax? If a real event, what caused the crater to appear so suddenly and then vanish so mysteriously? The speculation continues, and the mystery remains unsolved.
