sorting and tabulation program to give frequency and percentage distribu-
tions of the important characteristics of sightings." In this way,
sorting, counting, and tabulating of information from the punched card
abstracts could be executed, and further, any emerging patterns or
trends might be identified and used in future, more sophisticated treat-
ment using statistical methods.
Attempts to Create a "Flying Saucer" Model
An attempt to discern meaningful trends and patterns in UFO sight-
ings then was made by analyzing the descriptions of the physical appear-
ance, flight characteristics, and other significant attributes of vari-
ous classes of UFOs. Of the 43 object sightings identified as "Unknowns", only 12 were described in enough detail that they could serve
as the basis for the creation of a "flying saucer model". Other
sighting data did, however, sometimes coincide with certain features of
the reported UFOs in these four categories.
These 12 sightings could be placed in four categories on the
basis of their shapes:
