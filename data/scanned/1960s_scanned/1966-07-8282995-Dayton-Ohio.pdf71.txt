Call from Marysville, Pa 17053 who is visiting in the Dayton area. He saw an object traveling SE to NW. He never say anything like it and he certainly knows what an aircraft looks like. This didn't have caution lights. Lights seemed to revolve slowly. It would go slow and then fast, disappeared near the Fairglair tower. It was like twenty lights surrounding. They would be on and then off. Called the base last night, 19 Jul 66 at 257-0122 and the guy who answered said he was looking for them but couldn't see them. Which thought the guy should be able to see them but really wasn't looking.
Lt. Marley explained that certain portions of W-F are at quite a distance from Dayton and they might not be able to observe it. Sent a Form 14h on 19 Jul at his request.
