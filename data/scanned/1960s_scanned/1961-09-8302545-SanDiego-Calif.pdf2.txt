REFERENCE: DOD Release No. 179-62, February 6, 1962
Air Force UFO Report

Gentlemen:
This letter is in reply to the above mentioned news release issued by the Department of Defense on February 6, 1962, regarding Air Force Unidentified Flying Object Report No. 179-62.

I appreciate your reply but cannot agree with you. News releases will not convince the public that flying saucers do not exist.

Since you think flying saucers are so unimportant, why do you bother issuing a press release on the subject? Obviously, it shouldn't be worth the paper or time. Since you did bother with a five-page release, apparently there is more to the subject than you admit. Your conclusions regarding sightings, reflections, lights, balloons, etc. and then you state that all UFOs "could be natural phenomena." Why should we believe you? The Defense of the United States is always the excuse.

Why continue people "you can't give your case the Office of Aerial Phenomena." This way, people get confused with the "National Investigating Committee on Aerial Phenomena." We are not going to be even more confused.

On page 2 you give a UFO Report Evaluation by Category and Percentage Breakdown. I notice that 175 of the sightings were considered "astronomical." Of course, since you call most UFOs astronomical, this is understandable. Why don't you admit the obvious - that a certain percentage cannot be explained away so easily? Doesn't it?

Since these so-called objects do not give any indication of threat to the national security (your statement), why is the Department of Defense issuing news releases on the subject? Why are photographs and other data confiscated from people who have evidence of flying saucers? Something is not quite right here.
