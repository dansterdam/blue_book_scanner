Letter to Mr. ____
Echo submitting an angle of 3.91 seconds is below the level of resolution capabilities (Echoes greater than 4.4 seconds are actually seeing the light reflected from the surface of the satellite). This is comparable to the faintest reflections obtained from a mirror which, under ideal conditions, can be used as mirrors for signaling in survival kits.

You were obviously correct in your thoughts about the relationship of your person to any shadow cast by Echo on the night of 17 August 1960. As you have already recognized, any of the surface from which its signal originate would not fall upon the observer.

There have, on other occasions, been objects attributed to the Air Force which were in conjunction with Echo, but as yet no data has been obtained to permit identification. The most probable cause of these sightings is misidentification of high flying jet aircraft at night illuminated by the satellite as to distance and velocity.

Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Lt. Colonel, USAF
