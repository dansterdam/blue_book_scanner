Dear Mr. Peacekeeper Sontian -
I have given your name to the Defense Department who have contacted me regarding a report I made sometime last year concerning a strange object seen in the sky over Dixon, Illinois. This object was observed by my wife and myself one evening shortly after 8 o'clock. We were in our car coming home and as we rounded a curve, we both noticed a bright light in the sky. It seemed to be some sort of a disc or cigar-shaped object which was making no sound and appeared to be hovering or 'standing still' above the horizon. We watched it for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. This was not the first time we had seen such an object, but it was certainly the most clear and prolonged observation we had made. If the Defense Department has any further questions, please have them contact me. I appreciate your interest in this matter and will be most anxious to learn the results of any investigation.

Sincerely yours,
(Signature)
