The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate UFO reports.

Text extracted from the document:

because I still don't know what the hell it was they saw. I think I'm going to try and get in touch with Mr. I'm thinking I'll let him know I think probably if I call Mr. also and get his part of his contact with them, and particularly see if he has any records they may have made at the time.

If you think of anything else that you feel that I should know about this I'm easily reachable; simply the Department of Astronomy, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. Or send it through Colonel Quintanilla; I so there ones a month as a sort of regular tour of duty and look over the cases they've had during the month.

Let me ask a purely general question here. In your area down there, have there been many, or any, UFO reports that were not easily solvable?

** Very, very few sir. If we have them, they're normally widely scattered and I think here a month ago we had maybe a sighting in the Montgomery area here. Once in a while there are some down along the Coast, but, of course, I never know. I see something in the newspaper, or get something reported past me here at work, but normally there's no conclusion out of it.

H Yes. Well, if something comes up that you feel compares with this, or is other than could easily be explained as an aircraft or balloon, or something, I would appreciate your getting in touch with me, or with Project Bluebook.

** All right sir. We certainly will. Well, thanks ever so much.
VW Thank you Dr., it's been nice talking to you.
