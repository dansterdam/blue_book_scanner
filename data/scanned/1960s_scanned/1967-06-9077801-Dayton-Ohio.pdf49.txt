The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document that includes a diagram and instructions for the viewer. The diagram shows a curved line with angle measurements and a compass rose. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine a point on the curved line and draw how high the object was above the horizon, as well as indicate on the compass where the object was last seen.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
