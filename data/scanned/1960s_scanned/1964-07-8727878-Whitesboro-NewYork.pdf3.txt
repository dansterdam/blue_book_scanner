Later that night two of these spotted object were observed. The other of these strange objects was watching the way for about 10 minutes, when it appeared to disappear in the west. The object was 10:03 P.M., when it appeared on the western sky and proceeded very low on the horizon until it disappeared in the south west. The first two almost exactly the same speed. However, at one point three one seemed to pause as had the other.

Could it be possible to explain this again in the light of the objects as a real event and consideration in reading this letter.
