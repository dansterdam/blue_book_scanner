The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch appears to be a compass rose, with the instructions "NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 4 ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN." The smaller sketches appear to be illustrations of some kind of phenomenon or object observed in the sky.
