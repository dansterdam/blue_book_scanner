HOW TO DROP YOUR ATTENTION TO BE LOWER THAN USUAL AVERAGE EVERYDAY NORMAL WHICH IT WAS NOT BEFORE. WITNESS DOES NOT EXPECT IT AND CAN NOT FIGURE HOW OR WHY HIS ATTENTION LOWERED IN HIS OWN FIELD OF OBSERVATION WHICH HE CLAIMS SOMETHING WAS VERY STRANGE ABOUT AT THE TIME IT HAPPENED TO HIM. WITNESS COULD NOT CONCENTRATE ON ANYTHING ELSE OR CONTROL HIS NORMAL THOUGHT PATTERNS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER OBJECT DISAPPEARED. THE OBJECT SEEMED TO AFFECT SOME MENTAL CONTROL OR DISTRACTION OF SOME KIND ON WITNESSES. WITNESS ALSO STATES HIS COMPANION WHO WAS DRIVING CAR BECAME SUDDENLY NERVOUS AND TENSE DURING OBSERVATION AND AFTER OBJECT DISAPPEARED. WITNESS AND HIS WIFE UPHOLD HIS CONVICTIONS EVEN MORE.
