When I got home I realized that my wife had seen the same object as I did. We both saw this unusual flying object hovering over the house. At first it looked like a star but then it started moving around erratically. Although I looked for a few minutes, I couldn't see any wings or tail. It just hovered there and then suddenly took off at a tremendous speed in the sky.

I didn't seem to have a normal flight pattern. There was no sound on the tail lights as they became brighter. As they began to leave I came back home very disappointed.

I wasn't going to report it but I felt that it should be known that it wasn't a normal aircraft. I couldn't really see what it was. But it seemed to be some kind of vehicle that I have no information on. I have never seen anything like it before or since. I was reported in the local newspaper as just another flying saucer but I was the only one around at the time.
