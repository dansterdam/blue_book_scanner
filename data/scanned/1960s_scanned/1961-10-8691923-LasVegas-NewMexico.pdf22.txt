GRAFTON, N.D. (AP) -- The sheriffs department reported Monday that a strange object was sighted in the sky over Grafton Sunday night.
The object, described as glowing and about 500 feet in diameter, was seen by several persons in the area, including the sheriff and the police chief.
The object, reportedly at an altitude of about 5,000 feet, was observed for some time and then disappeared, heading generally south and east.

The report stated the object was seen by the sheriff, the police chief and several other persons, all of whom were driving or standing outside at the time.
The sheriffs department said it received numerous calls about the object and that it was observed by many people.
