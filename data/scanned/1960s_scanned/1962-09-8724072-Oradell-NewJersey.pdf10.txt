Office of Public Information
Washington 25, D.C.
September 25, 1962

Gentlemen:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your recent letter to
this office regarding a report of an unidentified flying
object (UFO) sighting in Oradell, New Jersey on September 1, 1962.

We are the Air Force compilations of UFO statistics and would you kindly send me the license fact sheets.

On September 1, 1962, a number of Oradell, New Jersey residents reported seeing a bright light in the sky. The Air Force investigated this sighting and concluded that the object was the planet Venus, which was very bright and prominent in the sky at that time. This explanation is consistent with the information you provided in your letter.

I hope this information is helpful. Sincerely yours,
