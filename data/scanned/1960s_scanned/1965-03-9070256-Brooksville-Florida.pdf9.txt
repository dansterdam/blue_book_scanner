The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a detailed description of an alleged UFO incident. There is no photograph present in this particular image.

Performing OCR on the text in the image:

Diameter of object observed: 30-35 feet, according to dimensions of hole it was possibly only 25-30 feet.
Hole - Diameter says 4-5 inches diameter, 4 inches deep. Max Dill AFB says 6 inch diameter, 4 inch deep. Photo of hole shows 7+ inch diameter.
Photos show leaves in hole are not crushed. It seems leaves and grass were pulled up from bottom of hole. Also hole looks like it was dug with small sand shovel.
Picture of hole indicates something larger hit right above the hole, about 12 inches wide dirt ring, dirt did not indicate this.
If it was already in bushes how could he take off for bushes.
"Opening saw sunlight or light in center" it was shining, they say only one robot. "They said they're going to one at a time," after they got thru it all in time there was no image on film this "opening under the saucer."
"Chamber he went up inside" if a chamber go up into the ship, when chamber was underneath ship and ship was how could he see a chamber so up into the ship, only the off chamber.
News clipping said "He didn't go very far from saucer, found it still there about 100 ft or so." News have said go to 15 ft of where's, robot. 
Photo shows a brush and tree area. How could a person see an object 100 yards away, only can see high, diameter 15-30 ft, landing gear.
"He then couldn't blink an eye, just how could he remember so much and move so much."
said looked, and I found some very, some kind of writing material with some very quer writing on it.
