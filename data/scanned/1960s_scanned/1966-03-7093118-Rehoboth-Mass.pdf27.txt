UFO SUMMARY (Rehoboth, Mass. 3/30/66)
SIGHTING BACKGROUND:
News of the sighting reached the Chairman via press service teletype message at DELILLAES/7:11 PM. Contact Subcommittee member Bengt G. Holmquist in this regard.
This agent arrived at the Rehoboth, Massachusetts State Police Barracks 29/30 at which time he stated stat SHAP was "occypied" to take the report. When contacted, the officer in charge stated that the report was not on duty this day.
This agent requested the original signed Sighting Report Form and was told by the desk officer that the report was still being prepared and would be forwarded. This report has not been received as of this writing.
The four young people who made report were sent to the State Police by local Rehoboth Police Headquarters and contrary to earlier press and radio service statements found that additional sightings of 1/30/66-C2 had been reported and recorded in the Rehoboth Police Blotter at 8:15 PM and the description of the UFO matches those given in this SHAP report as well.
I drove to Rehoboth Police Headquarters and contacted Lt. SHAP who was cooperative. He provided additional information as follows:
This agent visited one of the persons who reported their sighting and promised to send them to interview, but has not done so as of this time.
Tactics with some friends (referred to in SHAP report) when they say they saw the UFO.
At 6:00 PM I interviewed the four young people. (Ref: Comm #1) The appeared to be telling the truth and answered all questions candidly. ALL indicated they had no knowledge of the general UFO phenomenon and believe what they saw was an extraordinary aerial device. I made a radio check survey throughout the area where the sighting took place and found no evidence of any broken branches or grass except for a few recently broken branches. There was no evidence indicating an impact had landed in the area.
