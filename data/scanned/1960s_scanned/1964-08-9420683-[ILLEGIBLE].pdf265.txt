Dear Sir,

On or about the night ot August 15, 1964 while at my grandparent's cottage at Rainier on Lake Washington 25 miles east of Seattle, Washington, my attention was drawn to the eastern sky at about 10:40 PM. I observed what appeared to be a luminous object approximately 1 1/2 to 2 magnitudes brighter than the brightest star in the sky at the time, proceeding in a straight line from slightly north of east to slightly south of west at an apparent angular velocity of approximately 1 degree per second. The object appeared to be self-luminous, without trail or halo, and seemed to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. I watched it for approximately 5 to 10 seconds as it traversed about 10 degrees of arc in the sky before it disappeared below the western horizon. I am a graduate engineer and am quite familiar with aircraft of all types, as well as astronomical phenomena. This object did not conform to the characteristics of any known aircraft, nor did it have the appearance of a meteor, satellite, or any other recognized astronomical body. I am completely at a loss to account for what I observed on this occasion, and would appreciate any comments or observations you may be able to provide regarding this incident.

Sincerely yours,
