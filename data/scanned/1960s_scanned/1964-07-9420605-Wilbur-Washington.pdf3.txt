The image contains no photograph, only text. I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

"REPORT CARD

Ihe sighting of a satel-lite-like
objc.t travelled from saw to ago and about 7-3* west
of this location is definitely the —
inspection or thi., object and the tare re.rking.s nada on the back of

The first word is redacted, followed by "SIGHTDATA". The text then describes the sighting of a satellite-like object that traveled from east to west at about 7-3* degrees west of the location. It mentions an inspection of the object and markings made on the back of an envelope. The text ends with the note "AFD AUG 24 1964".
