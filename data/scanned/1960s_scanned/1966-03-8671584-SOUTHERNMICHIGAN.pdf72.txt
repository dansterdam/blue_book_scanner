The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed text document containing information about certain gases and lights associated with UFO sightings.

It was from these academic gentlemen that I obtained the information on marsh gas and the lights frequently associated with it.

It appears that rotting vegetation in the swamps produced certain gases in ample quantities. Methane is odorless. This is not but since it is present in relatively small quantities one does not smell it unless one overturns a shovel full of swamp material which would tend when released to give a distinct odor I am told.

In addition, phosphine gas is produced by the reduction of phosphorous compounds in the marsh material. These three gases are ordinary do not spontaneously ignite. I am told that a small quantity in the fog does burn with a highly flame like and eerie aspect reminiscent of ignitish, which then apparently can serve to ignite the other gases.

The phenomena of swamp lights is apparently, quite well known, and references to it are ample in the literature. Even in ordinary technical literature these lights, variously as will-o'-the-wisp, ignis, fatuus, corpse lights etc. have had many stories wove around them including such stories as the souls of the departed as well as elemental mythological entities.
