Gentlemen:
Attached please find photo and story of a high-flying phenomenon sighted near the 26,000 ft. level by members of a Canadian Pacific Airlines flight crew.
I do not know your office has already been reported this incident, but in case it has not, the report was made by the Canadian Pacific Airlines cr ew members who saw the object passing above them at high speeds and in on unusual maneuvering pattern.
I can assure you, as many others have, that the employees of Canadian Pacific Airlines have a real understanding of aircraft and aircraft phenomena, and if they state they saw an unusual aerial object, then I believe them.
Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
M. St. Boniface St. Manitoba Canada
