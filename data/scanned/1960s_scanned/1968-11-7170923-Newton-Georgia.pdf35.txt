H Was there, did you notice any smell in the area after it had left?
J To be perfectly honest with you I didn't see any smell around long enough to find out. I blew the radiator on my car going to Albany. Let's put it this way, when I got to Albany the water was just pouring out of my radiator. 
H And a 67 Ford at that.
J Whether the beam, somebody said, well may be the beam had something to do with it. Well, I don't know, but I know I drove between 105 and 110 all the way to Albany. Well, I drove the 11 miles at that speed, then I stopped; then I drove 22 miles to Albany at that speed. And when I got to Albany the car was pouring water out the bottom.
H I can certainly see why. Did you ever check the battery? We've had some reports that the batteries have badly damaged in such encounters.
J Well, the battery hasn't shown any damage since this night. The entire electrical system and engine and everything has functioned 100% since then.
H Well, this is most interesting account and I hope you'll be willing in case I should have any other questions later to come back to you abit. And certainly I will hope very much that if anything else comes up in that area I can call on you. Also, please now, I really mean this, I do hope you'll check some other try and find the other hunter, because every your experience is such a good one, and you're obviously such an intelligent nature that you're account is, well it hangs together; it's not a vague account by any means. So, I'm all the more interested in getting you to talk with Maxwell and seeing what you can find out from him.
J I'll be most happy to.
