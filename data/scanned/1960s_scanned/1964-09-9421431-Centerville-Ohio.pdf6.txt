The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch and diagram. The sketch shows a curved line to depict the horizon, and instructions for the viewer to indicate the point where an object was seen above the horizon and how it moved during the observation. The diagram appears to be a compass or direction indicator. There is also some handwritten text associated with the sketch and diagram.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
