Women See "UFO" At Lewisburg
Lewisburg, Ohio - (UPI) - Mrs. Pauline Taylor, 53, and her daughter, Mrs. Dorothy Smith, 25, said they saw an unidentified flying object over Lewisburg Tuesday night. 
"It just couldn't be," said Mrs. Taylor. "But we saw it just the same."
The women said the object was larger than a regular airplane, about 60 feet long, and had bright lights on the front and rear. 
"The only way to measure it was that it seemed to be as long as the width of our house," Mrs. Smith said.
"There is a hill behind the house and the object seemed to be hovering over that, just above the treetops," she said.
"I couldn't believe it was a airplane because there were no motors and no wings," Mrs. Taylor said. "And it wasn't making any noise like an airplane either."
The women said the object remained in view for about five minutes before it disappeared from sight, moving toward the east.
"It was strange-looking object to be in the air, and I've never seen anything like it before," Mrs. Taylor said.
The Air Force's Project Blue Book, which investigates UFO sightings, has been notified, the women said.
