Dear Mr. M...:

Your letter of October 30, concerning UFO and other strange airborne objects in the Seattle area is acknowledged. We will be glad to investigate any further sightings that you may have, and to add this case to our files.

As for your two sightings on October 23, the details given indicate this was probably some type of aircraft, not an unusual object. If any new details come to light that might change this conclusion, please let me know, and I will again make an investigation.

Thank you for your interest.

Yours truly,

JOSEPH F. VITTICER, MR. 
Captain, U.S. Air Force
Information Officer
