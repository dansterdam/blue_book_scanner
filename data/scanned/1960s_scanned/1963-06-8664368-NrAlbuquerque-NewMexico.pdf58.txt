NEW ZEALAND
Cigar-shaped object
over Taupo

The following report of an unusual sighting of an unidentified object over Taupo, New Zealand was carried in the Flying Saucer Review. Two independent observers in the area reported seeing the object on consecutive evenings over the same area. In both cases the object was described as cigar-shaped and in the first case it was said to leave a vapor trail much like the one left by a jet plane. One of the observers, a retired insurance man, reported that he watched the object for some time as it moved across the sky and passed over some commercial planes or jets in the area at the time.
