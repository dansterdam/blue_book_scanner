Officer: It Was Big, Red, The Bank and Them Solar
On September 26, 1966, at approximately 10:00 p.m., I was on patrol in the area of Southhampton, Long Island, New York. As I was driving along Montauk Highway, I noticed a large, red, glowing object in the sky to the east. It appeared to be hovering over the Bridgehampton National Bank. I stopped the car and observed the object for several minutes. It seemed to be about 300 feet in diameter and was approximately 1,000 feet in the air. The object made no sound and appeared to be stationary. After a few minutes, the object suddenly took off at a high rate of speed and was out of sight in a matter of seconds. I immediately reported the incident to the authorities.
