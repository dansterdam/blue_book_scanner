Report of the Project Blue Book, re: Pittsburgh, Pa., 7 August 1965

On 7 Aug 65 a white disc shaped object was seen at 1950 hours (7:50 PM) by a witness  The object was about 25-30 feet in diameter and was observed for several minutes. The witness said it was very bright, giving off a bright glow. It was traveling in a straight line at a very high rate of speed, much faster than any known aircraft. The object turned slightly and moved up and down an up and down movement. There were some fuzzy areas around the edges of the object. As it moved off there was a slight trail behind it. The witness said it was very bright, plus and there were some fuzzy areas around the edges. The object was observed from the back porch of the witness' residence and the object was flying low to the horizon. The object was first observed when it came from the east and was visible for just a few seconds. The witness said the object was unlike any aircraft he had ever seen. 

Reference sighting by Miss......., Pittsburgh, Pa. 
The witness stated she was on her back porch and observed a bright, round, luminous object about the size of a bread pan hovering near the horizon. She said the object was larger than a star and had a bright glow around the edges. The object remained stationary for about 10-15 minutes and then gradually faded out of sight. The witness said the object was silent and did not appear to move during the observation.

(Possibly this could have been some type of conventional aircraft, although the description seems to indicate an unconventional aerial object).
