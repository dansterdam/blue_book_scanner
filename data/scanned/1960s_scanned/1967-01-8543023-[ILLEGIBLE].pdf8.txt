Dear Sir:

In reply to your request for information concerning our advertising, I will submit the following:

Our advertising is done with an electric sign which is mounted on a position under the airspace. It is constructed in three sections and is extended or retracted by using electric winches and ropes.

The sign measures eight feet wide and thirty-five feet long when extended. The letters move from the rear forward, and eight feet by four feet.

Under normal circumstances, the entire message of approximately 60 letters and spaces is issued every 20 seconds.

During the time the sign is extended and lighted, it is capable of traveling at an airspeed of 35 to 60 miles per hour. Assuming it is from one location to another, the bulbs are not lighted and it would appear to be a conventional aircraft.

This apparatus, when viewed from a side position of more than a half-mile distance, could cause some of the public who are not aviation conscious to consider it as an aircraft. At a distance of one mile or more, it is not possible to identify it as a sign and will appear to be a string of lights moving in a very busy pattern of lights, not as a definite object.

On moonlit nights, the aircraft can be distinguished, but on occasion it does not equal a natural aircraft.

When operating this sign, we are required by the words in our waiver to maintain contact, or forecast the FAA that the sign is in use.
