UFO INVESTIGATOR

EVIDENCE CONTRADICTS HOAX CLAIM

An investigation has been made of a UFO report originating at Glassboro, N.J., in September 1964. A trained Air Force officer, who was with the Strategic Air Command, reported seeing a strange object in the sky over Glassboro. The Air Force report indicates that the witness, who was considered a reliable observer, described the object as circular in shape, larger than a car, and hovering about 300 feet above the ground. The object then accelerated and disappeared from view in a matter of seconds. This case is being investigated further, and any new developments will be reported in a later issue.
