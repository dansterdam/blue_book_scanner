TRANSCRIPT OF PHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN HYNEK & MRS. LEITHA

H Hello, is Mrs. there?
L Just a minute. 
H Hello, Mrs. This is Allen Hynek at Northwestern University.
L Oh yes.
H Hi. Do you a minute to talk with me now?
L Yes
H Good. I am quite interested in the sighting that you had back there in April, the third of April I believe it was.
L Yes, it was.
H And several questions that I'd like to ask and I'm not sure whether the best thing to do here is to ask those questions or to ask you to sort of take a deep breath and start over again. First of all, are there any questions you want to ask of me, as to why this is being done, or what sort of thing? Or did I explain enough of that is the better?
L Well, I kind of know that, but the thing that I wondered about is, is it really something or isn't it? You know, because so many people look at you - like the other day there was some distant relation of mine I happened to see him on business, and he wanted to see me - and he looked at me just as much to say, well gee, what's the matter with you. Maybe I don't want to do business with you. You know. And I was just wondering if there is something or if there isn't or..
H Well, of course this is precisely what we're trying to find out. And you might think that after all this time we would know, but we don't.
