AS YOU IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS, FACING THE DIRECTION EXACTLY AS YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

THE PHENOMENON OR PLOT IT ON THE FIGURE. DO THIS BY CAREFULLY MARKING AN X ON THE COMPASS ROSE AT THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO COME, AND THEN DRAW A LINE FROM THE CENTER OUTWARD IN THAT DIRECTION. NEXT, MAKE A SKETCH OF WHAT WAS SEEN, USING THE SMALLER SKETCHES AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE LARGER SKETCH.
