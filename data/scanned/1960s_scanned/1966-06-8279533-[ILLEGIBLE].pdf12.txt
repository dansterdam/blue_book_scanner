Dear sir:

I wish to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object that occurred on June 4, 1966 at about 9:30 p.m. EDT. The object was first sighted hovering over my home for a few seconds. It then rapidly moved off to the southeast, rising to an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The object appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was brightly lit, emitting a bluish-white light. It seemed to be oval or saucer-shaped in appearance. The object moved with no sound and at a very high rate of speed. The sighting lasted only about 15 seconds.

This is part of a report of Case # 3 of Charlotte, N.C. dated June 20, 1966.
