The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a letter addressed to "Dear Sir" from the Office of Information, which appears to be responding to an observation of some object over Vandalia, Ohio. The letter mentions that "the object" which was observed was considered to be "a satellite" and that "the two lights" which were observed were "normal aircraft." There is no photograph present in this particular page.

The text contained in the document is as follows:

"The object which you observed over Vandalia, Ohio, on July 13, 1965, at 10:45 p.m., was considered to be a satellite, USAF I.

The two lights which you observed for three minutes, from 11:10 to 11:13 p.m., were normal aircraft.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Community Relations Division
