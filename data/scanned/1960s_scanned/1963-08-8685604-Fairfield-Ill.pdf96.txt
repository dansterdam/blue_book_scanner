"Stranger Object" Is Seen
Shined around with Flashing Lights, and Courtesy Upward (lett) as he probed to the Ground that Made Him Wonder Whet It All Meant
Mrs. Audrey Toler and family saw a strange object in the sky near their home on Tuesday evening at about 10:30 p.m. She said the object appeared to be hovering about 1,000 feet up in the sky and giving off a bright light that seemed to flash in all directions. It appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter.
 from the ground the object seemed large and somewhat round in shape, and it seemed to remain stationary for about 10 minutes. Then it began to move slowly in a southeast direction from their home, she said.
The family watched it intently for several minutes as it slowly disappeared into the dark sky. They saw no wings or other visible means of propulsion.
Mrs. Toler said her young son, Gary, was greatly impressed by the object and told his mother that it was "like nothing he had ever seen before."
