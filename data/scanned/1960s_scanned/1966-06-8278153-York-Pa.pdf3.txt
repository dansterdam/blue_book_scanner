To Whom it May Concern: 

Enclosed find report of investigation of sight ing. April 16, 1966 
near Wrightsville, Pa. 

It seems that a farmer in York County, Pa. observed a strange object 
flying overhead on the above date. Description of object: Oblong shaped, 
very bright, giving off a brilliant light, and making a definite noise. 
It traveled very fast and was airborne for a period of 10 to 15 minutes. 
It appeared to be approximately 100 feet in length.
Two other individuals were present and also viewed the strange aerial 
object and similarly first observed it at a distance of about 1 miles and 
what they could best estimate as through binocular lens. The object could 
not be identified as any known type aircraft and moved with great speed 
through the atmosphere. (See 164)
