The image shows a photograph of various inflatable structures, including what is described as a "solar collector". The text below the image provides a detailed description of the solar collector, explaining how it is collapsed into a small package, inflated in space, and how it functions to collect energy from the sun. The text mentions the solar collector's ability to generate electrical energy, and provides some technical specifications about its performance.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
I mentioned there was one last type of structure that you might be interested in. That is one that we might want to have as a very large structure, but it doesn't have to have a high load-carrying ability, such as for instance a solar collector. Figure 27 illustrates here a typical SOLAR COLLECTOR
It is collapsed in a small package. We put it in space. We inflate it and sterilized it so when it is punctured by micro-meteorites it doesn't leak. I will show you a movie on the inflated structure and how it can be done at her.
(Movie shown of foaming in attitude chamber.)
Dr. Ross: This is an attitude chamber. This is a body that is inflated here. The solar concentrator is the portion on the end. This is a large area, it will collect solar rays. This is a inflated structure, a high temperature will be built off of the part we don't need. The Sun's rays can strike the mirror and be collected and with an energy converter would change it into electrical energy.
This is an example of a typical unit that you can see how it concentrates the energy. This is found to be concentrated about 3,500 points on it. We have come within 95 percent of what would be theoretically possible.
