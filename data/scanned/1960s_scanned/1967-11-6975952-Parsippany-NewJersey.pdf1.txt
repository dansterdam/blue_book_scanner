The observer and a friend also saw the object. The witness' parents saw it. The parents of the boy denied having seen any UFO on 12 Nov 1967. Both boys have seen several UFO sightings in the past. No one reported any such object to the Parsippany police department. Although the image in the photo does not definitively identify the object, the photograph is a hoax and the photo of some man made object.
The observer sighted and photographed an object that looked like two paper plates with a domed shape. The object made a humming noise and "animals were barking."
