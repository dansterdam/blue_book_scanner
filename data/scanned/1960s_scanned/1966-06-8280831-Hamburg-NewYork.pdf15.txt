Transcribed text from the document:

I guess I have heard as much as any one else looking into this case. These things seem to be traveling at some speed as they were seen briefly and disappeared. The sightings were over in a minute or so. From the reports I have read, the objects were flying at an estimated 5000 to 10,000 feet altitude and moving at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 mph. The object observed was circular in shape with a slight convex upper surface. It appeared to be about 20 to 30 feet in diameter. The color of the object was aluminum or light gray. This thing was turning and performing maneuvers which appeared to be under intelligent control. There was no sound associated with the observation. The object was in view only briefly and then disappeared rapidly. I have not seen any motion picture or still photography of this particular incident.
