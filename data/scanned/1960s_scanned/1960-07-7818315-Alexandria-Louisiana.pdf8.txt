The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will attempt to transcribe all the text found in the document:

The unidentified light was of a reddish tint and cylindrical in shape. It appeared to be hovering at an altitude of approximately 800 to 1000 ft. The light remained stationary for approximately 30 to 40 seconds and then suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view. The light was observed to be silent and gave no indication of any sound during its presence. It was of sufficient size and brightness to be observed from a considerable distance. The witness was a man of good judgment and keen powers of observation. His report is considered to be reliable and accurate.
