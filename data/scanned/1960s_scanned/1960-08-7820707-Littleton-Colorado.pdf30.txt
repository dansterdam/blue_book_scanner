SAUCER "FLAPS" IN CALIFORNIA: The incident described on page 12 seems to have been one of the most interesting waves of UFO sightings on record. At least 20 people saw a large, dull grey, metallic-looking object, variously described as 60 to 80 feet in diameter. It was hovering above some trees at an estimated height of 500 to 800 feet. One of the witnesses, a well-known businessman, at least 20 people saw a bright light, a metallic gray object and some greenish lights around the craft. The object made no sound and moved very fast. The entire sighting lasted about 1 minute.  
The object came into view from the east and after making a horizontal flight of about 2 miles at a constant speed and about 600 feet altitude, it disappeared suddenly. One of the witnesses stated that at one time blue and white lights were displayed and diving at tremendous speed. They were dazzling and as they descended, the craft came closer so that the size could be estimated more accurately. The duration of the sighting was about a half minute. The observers stated that the craft was tilted at an angle and the motion was like a disc which seemed to be spinning. All of the witnesses were highly reliable. Most of them are business and professional people, and some are former military personnel.
