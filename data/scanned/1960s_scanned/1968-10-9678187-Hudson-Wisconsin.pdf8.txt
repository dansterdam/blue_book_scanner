SAF-OICC/Miss Turner/75530/Oct. 29, 1968

Dear ***,

This is a reply to your letter of October 23, 1968, in which you reported that you and a friend had seen an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you saw. However, if you will complete the inclosed questionnaire to the best of your ability, we will conduct an investigation to attempt to determine the nature of the object your friend saw. We are interested in obtaining all pertinent details from eyewitnesses at the scene.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base, civilian or military. This usually results in a more accurate and complete investigation.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the catalogs of objects reported as UFO's in the "Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14" which is available in many libraries.

Sincerely,
JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Air Branch
Directorate of Information Division
Office of Information
