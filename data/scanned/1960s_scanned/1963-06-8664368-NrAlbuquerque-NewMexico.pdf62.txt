The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which discusses a UFO sighting that occurred in Cleveland, Ohio on June 16, 1963. The text states that the witnesses claimed to have sighted a UFO, but no photograph of the object was obtained as it was too dim and did not show up.
