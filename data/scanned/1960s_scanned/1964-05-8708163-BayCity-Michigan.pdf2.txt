Transcribing the text from the document:

7. AVOTTE. On 25 May, a [redacted] Bay City, Michigan, called this investigator to report that he had seen a light at 0030 moving almost directly overhead, from west to east, taking approximately five minutes to move straight overhead to 17 degrees point in the east. It made no noise, was half the brightness of Jupiter, and every now and then wavered in direction. This is clearly Echo I, the wavering being a practically universal optical illusion. [Redacted] emphasized to everyone that he had a small telescope, on questioning, it turned out that he did not actually try to see the object through the telescope.
[Redacted] is a student at MSU; Bay City is about 100 miles northeast of Lansing.
7. 0030 EST, 25 May 1964. Witness saw light moving from near zenith to west-southeast in about 5 minutes. Conclusion: Echo I, Bay City, Michigan.
