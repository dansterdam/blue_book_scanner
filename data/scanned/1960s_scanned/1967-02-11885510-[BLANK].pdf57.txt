APPENDIX III
POWER REQUIREMENTS

In considering a radio communication link between our civilization and another civilization, it is of interest to determine the power which must be radiated in the direction of the other civilization.

The power requirement can be calculated by the following equation:

w = Iv (d1)2 (d2)2 R2

where d1 = diameter of the transmitting reflector
d2 = diameter of the receiving reflector
R = distance between reflectors

Equation (1) reduces to:

w = Iv (d1)2 (d2)2 R2 - 10^-24.2 R^2 / d1^2 d2^2 watt/cps (2)

under the assumption that the hydrogen radio frequency line is used and that the other civilization is at a rather high galactic latitude where the level of interference (determined by the cosmic radiation background) is much smaller. Two types of interference which have to be considered are radio emissions from the star around which the inhabited planet revolves and background cosmic radiation. The intensity of this interstellar interference in the
