MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJ: Call fm Col Wyatt, SAC Hq
At 2350 hours, 23 Oct 69, Col Wyatt, called Lt Marano and wanted to know if we (Lt Marano) had received any indication of any other reports from Minot.
Lt Marano informed him that we haven't received any other reports from that area.
We do get a copy of reports in accordance with AFR 80-17. Lt Marano told Col Wyatt that Col Werlick at Minot was doing the investigation. Col Werlick had called the Duty Officer at Wright-Patterson who in turn called Lt Marano and he (Lt M) called Col Quintanilla and they both called Col Werlick. Col Wyatt said he was trying to determine whether ADC had any known phenomena on radar. Col Wyatt asked Lt Marano if we ever participated in any investigations. Very seldom do we ever go out in the field. As far as Lt Marano was concerned Col Werlick was quite competent and he didn't feel that Col Werlick needed any additional help at this time. Col Wyatt said he gave Col Werlick the guidance and he presumed that Col Werlick got the telephone number out of the regulation.
Col Wyatt said he felt that we couldn't give him any more information so he ended the conversation.
