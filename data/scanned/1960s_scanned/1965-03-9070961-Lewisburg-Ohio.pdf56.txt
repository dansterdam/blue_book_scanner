The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains several illustrations and instructions, but does not appear to contain any photographs.

The text in the document states:

29. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "X" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass line to show the direction from which the object appeared. Place an "X" on the compass line to show the direction in which the object disappeared.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
