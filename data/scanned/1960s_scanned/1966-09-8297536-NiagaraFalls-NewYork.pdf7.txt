NO CASE   INFO ONLY

On the morning of September 8, 1966, a very bright and silent object was observed north of Buffalo, New York, near Niagara Falls.

The object was much brighter than any stars and larger than any aircraft. It was hovering and moved in a zig-zag pattern, changing directions sharply. It remained visible for approximately 15 minutes.

No sound was heard. The object flew low, then climbed up and then descended sharply. It then seemed to move out of sight. Several people observed this object.
