My husband and I have recently completed our investigation and recreation. Also, he was elected as a member of the National Recreation and Parks Assoc. "George" has advised me to send my report to the U. S. Air Force officials.

You may make copies of my report and letter in the event that you want to send them to other Gov't offices. However, I do not want the enclosed material to be released for public reading. I hope that my report will serve some use.

Thank you.

Yours truly,
Mrs. [redacted]

P.S. I am enclosing one of our Metropolitan papers in which I have marked with red, some facts and two statements that are included in my report.
