There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Disappeared over the horizon.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what: 

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what: 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: NONE
b. Color: APPEARED WHITISH WITH TWO RED LIGHTS ON EACH END THAT STREAKED ONE WAY AND THEN THE OTHER AT TREMENDOUS SPEED. 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how large was the object in relation to the match head? IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE AS OBJECT WAS SO FAR AWAY AND AGAINST THE (UNR) UNNATURAL GREENISH GRAY OF THE SKY, THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE OF SIZE OR ALTITUDE, EXCEPT THAT IT WAS VERY HIGH UP.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, lights, or special features. OBJECT APPEARED LIKE LARGE WHITE DISC WITH TWO RED LIGHTS AT EACH END THAT STREAKED BACK AND FORTH AT TREMENDOUS SPEED AND THEN DISAPPEARED OVER HORIZON.
