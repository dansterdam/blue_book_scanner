The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book. The page contains handwritten text that describes an encounter with an unidentified object.

Text from the document:

"..said about 20 seconds (just a guess), but, up to the time it was screened, had not appeared to move appreciably, so far as he could tell or say. He said he was watching an object and it appeared to be quite bright and that it looked at first like an aircraft but there was no such object in the area, and the man said it appeared to be much larger than an aircraft and traveling much slower, and the man said he would not call it an aircraft."
