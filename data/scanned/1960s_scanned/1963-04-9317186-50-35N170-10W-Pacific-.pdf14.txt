The New Jersey Fireball of April 23, 1962
On the evening of Monday, April 23, 1962, observers all along the eastern seaboard of the United States were startled by the appearance of a brilliant object in the sky moving from southwest to northeast. This object was reported as a fireball, and from parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania it was observed both visually and photographically. 
The event was observed by members of the American Astronomical Society. Both visual and photographic observations were made, and the fireball was estimated to be about magnitude -7, somewhat brighter than Jupiter. It was seen widely in the east, and reports of it came in from as far south as the Philadelphia area, where a flock of birds panicked and scattered, indicating the intensity of the light.
The fireball was studied and analyzed by various researchers, and its path was determined from photographs taken at several locations. It passed over northern New Jersey, being seen as far north as New York, and as far south as the Philadelphia area. From its observed path and velocity, it was calculated that the object entered the earth's atmosphere at an estimated altitude of 85 kilometers, moving at a velocity of 17 kilometers per second. From 22 reports, it appeared that the duration of the fireball was between 6 and 10 seconds. At its brightest, the fireball attained an apparent magnitude of -7, or about 35 kilometers per second. The body did not explode, and no fragments were recovered.
