Dear Friends:

After receiving your letter of March 16 I sent a copy of it (with your names and addresses omitted) to my friend Dr. R. W. Engstrom, president of the Radio Corporation of America.

He opines that "I have checked with a number of my associates and have not found anyone who is aware of any incident which would result in the report of the landing of an RCA building in Cherry Hill, New Jersey." From RCA's point of view, we believe that it is perfectly proper for the person who made this observation to explain to you exactly what he believed he saw on this occasion.

I suppose we will have to leave it at that unless you have some suggestions about other things that ought to be done.

Sincerely,

EUC: kes
