The image appears to contain a document from the Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) in the 1950s and 1960s. The document discusses an incident where multiple unidentified flying objects were detected by radar at altitudes between 60,000 and 90,000 feet, east of Merced, California. The report mentions that F-106 fighter jets were scrambled to investigate but could not maintain a lock on the objects due to the high altitudes. The document also mentions that the possibility of sending U-2 reconnaissance planes to investigate the objects is being considered.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now extract all the text from the document and provide it as output:

Received from Colonel Welms, Command Post, 10 April 64.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

Original Message: 
ICES: Radar advised that there were 6 to 12 unidentified flying objects at 30 miles East of Merced, California. Radar picked up 12 objects at altitudes 60,000 ft., 90,000 ft., and higher elevations.
F-106's were scrambled at Castle Air Force Base. There were no results because of high altitudes. They are checking the possibility of sending U-2's.

Later sent to Air Staff:
Objects were following a 60 mile race-track pattern. F-106's were flying at 29,000 ft. altitude. Pilots locked on to some of the objects but could not keep the lock. Norrad said they were sending 2 more aircraft with pilots in pressure suits.
