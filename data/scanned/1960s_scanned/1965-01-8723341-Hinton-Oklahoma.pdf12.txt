Dear Sir:

On January 30, 1965 at approximately 10:15 p.m. C.S.T. I saw what I believe to be a formation of flying saucers.

My friend, and I had been driving around town when he decided to drive us to a bathroom. As he pulled up to the bathroom, he noticed what he thought was a car and not falling but moving from east to west across the car and he called me to look. We both saw a formation of about 18 to 20 objects. They looked to be about the size of a little smaller. They were making no noise and green and red lights were glowing about 40Â° west above the horizon. As I watched, they moved in a straight line across from west to east. They were moving at an estimated speed of approximately 1,000 miles an hour. They crossed the front from west to east and we heard no sound. We waited to see if we could see them again but didn't. We called our friend to come look but they were gone when she got there.

Yours truly,

P.S. The information could have this too.
