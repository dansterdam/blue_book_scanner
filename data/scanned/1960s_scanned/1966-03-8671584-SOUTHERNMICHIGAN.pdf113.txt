CALLS OF 31 March 1966

MR SNYDER, CHICAGO DAILY NEWS - Science writer he has got up with a strange situation, they have made a villain of Dr Hynek in the paper. 

He would like to write an article titled "the perils of an UFO investigator".

There have been many unkind words about Dr Hynek. Major said that as far as he was concerned there is no one in this country more knowledgeable than Dr. Hynek about UFO phenomena. He has been a consultant to this project for the last 13 years. His reputation is without question, especially in the field of UFOs. 

Swamp gas is not an unique phenomena, I received a letter from a lady in Illinois who also thought that is what it was. Major read the letter to Mr. Snyder. I doubt if I could get a reputable scientist to go out and investigate a case like Dr. Hynek. You can't satisfy 100% of the people, there always will be someone who will not believe you. Major explained the general UFO program.
