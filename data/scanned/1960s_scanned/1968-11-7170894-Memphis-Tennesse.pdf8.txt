LENGTH OF TIME: 25 min, by end of phone call

HOW LONG WAS THE PHENOMENON IN SIGHT? 25 MIN, FAIRLY CERTAIN

FTD SDO was on the phone with observer for 20 min. Dropped from 1000 high as would a leaf, floating on air, while the object was close to the horizon (partly obscured). It was never really out of sight. It appeared as a light, changing color (red, blue, white green) approx 10 min it began to rise slightly. Observers could not estimate speed or distance from them, and thus would not estimate speed of the object.
