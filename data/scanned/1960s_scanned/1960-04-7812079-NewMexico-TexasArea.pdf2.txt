SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: Major Friend, AFOIN-4E

1. Major Brands, DC, USAF Command Post, called ATIC 16/2220, to relay a UFO Report received by USAF Command Post from a Major Harris on DOD at 16/2155 from a Major Reynolds, Intelligence Officer, Ellington AFB, Houston, Texas. The report of the UFO sighting approximately 16/2103 from a Lt. Dinny, 7-149th Observation Squadron, assigned to Ellington AFB, Houston, Texas. According to the report from Lt. Dinny, he observed a single unidentified flying object which appeared stationary for approximately 5 minutes and then departed at a high rate of speed. The report was relayed to ATIC through USAF Command Post, the USAF Indications Center, NORAD, and ATIC where all on duty were contacted. 

2. Lt. Dinn - Flying F-100 (attitude not available) reported sighting of single, brilliant-white light in apparent size similar to a pistol flare, descending 300 degrees to 330 degrees magnetic against the skyline. The object was observed on 16/2103 past.

3. Captain Mason - from his home in Clovis, New Mexico, Capt. Mason saw an object which he describes as in a descending motion. He added that he saw the object again a short time later and it appeared to be climbing at a high rate of speed.

2. Canon AFB reports that no planes were in the area or responsible for the sighting.
3. And at 16/2230 EST USAF Command Post, USAF Indications Center, NORAD and ATIC were notified. This indicates that the reports from Amarillo, Texas, Clovis, and Albuquerque, N.M. reports which were received from a Consolidated Communications Center at 16/2230 EST. There was considerable difficulty in contacting some of the personnel involved. All were only one object, traveling from northwest to southwest. Weather report from GUARD (report) is virtually useless since all reports seem to agree that because of the relative times of all reports, the 1900 - 2000 UST, that the object apparently was a meteor.

4. Standing by for more telecrons. 2330 hours. All quiet. 17/0145.
