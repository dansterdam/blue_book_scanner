The image does not contain any photograph or visual element. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire or observation form.

The text found in the document is as follows:

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
MOVE JERKY OR DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR? 
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
FLASH OFF FLICKERS?
MOVE LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
IF FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
IS WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

Scribbled on the right, there is the text:
"Seen on night"

At the bottom, there is the text:
"How did it finally disappear?
Fade"

And at the bottom of the form, there is the text:
"Did the phenomenon move behind or in front of something, like a cloud, tree, or building at any time?
Yes if yes, describe"
