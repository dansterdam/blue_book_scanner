There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document, specifically page 7 of the document.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
- There have talked to a number of people who have seen the object I saw, but none in Dayton, Ohio. They were seen in other areas of Ohio. I have talked with people that have expressed an interest in seeing such objects.
This seems to be a sighting report form with questions about the date the questionnaire was completed and information the witness felt was pertinent but not covered in the specific questions.
