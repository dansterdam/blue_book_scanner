Proposed reply to letter from Mike Lyczany

Dear Mr. Lyczany,

This replies to your recent correspondence regarding an unidentified observation in mid-April 1967.

We are unable to make a positive identification without the exact date. The description you submitted is consistent with that of a satellite; however, without an exact date and time, we cannot make a definitive conclusion. The information will be filed as insufficient data for evaluation.

If in the future you should observe another UFO, you should report it to the nearest Air Force installation as soon as possible. This will enable them to perform a prompt and comprehensive investigation.

S. D. F. 31 May 67
