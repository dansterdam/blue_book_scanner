Station men see flying discs
Twelve "silvery, saucer-like" objects trailing a white substance which could be condensation were sighted flying over Western Australia. They could be seen clearly for several minutes, according to reports received here.
The objects were observed at about 10,000 ft. - one of the highest reported flying speeds of such objects.
Sheerers on Mr. Hale's station observed the objects. They were able to keep the pairs of "saucers" in sight for several minutes as they travelled from north to south.
"Showy" described the objects as "saucer-shaped but larger than the moon." They came from the north and went to the south, travelling at fantastic speed. There was no sound and no vapour trail. Other station hands also saw the objects.
