There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I have produced the following text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Disappeared off and on

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. Yes, then tell what it moved behind: Seemed to blot out a small part of the distant horizon, as if i blocked behind something

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color Orangish red

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About the size of the match head, or maybe a little larger

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object they you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[A simple drawing is shown, with various geometric shapes, and an arrow indicating the direction of movement.]
