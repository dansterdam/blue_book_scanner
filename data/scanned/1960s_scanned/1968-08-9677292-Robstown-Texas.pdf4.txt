TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

Started not to send the enclosed back -- really completed the questionnaire for my own file. But if here it is.

Several of us, here in Suburban Acres, have seen many UFO's but have been frustrated, so many times, in attempting to report sightings. I have talked to Chief Ramos, at the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station, several times -- and you would have to go so many hours of the day. The following is a conversation I had with someone in the Police Dept. (and this is one of the nicer ones):

ME: Are you being molested?
HE: No, but -
ME: Well, who do you think you are?
HE: We'll, I'm trying to report a UFO sighting.
ME: Oh, is that all! Well, that's not an emergency. Call the papers or magazines if you want publicity. Most people around here think you're crazy if you report one.

Not exactly what I had in mind. The way in which the Air Police treat people is something else! They act as though people don't mind the little green men and the white strait jacket jokes if they have seen something. It seems the only way they'll listen is for a whole family to be missing or something much worse. 

I did drink, take dope, make up wild stories, or want publicity. I am not trying to do anything about the sightings, only to report them. I am just as much a tax-paying citizen as the next person and I watch for phenomena that I think might be of national interest. Chief Ramos in Corpus told me that people who report UFO's but decline reporting them for reasons stated above.

Sincerely,
