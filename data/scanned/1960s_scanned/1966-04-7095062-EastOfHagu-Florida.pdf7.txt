Apr 25, Air Force spoke with Colonel Cranit of Major Air Force Investigation CISO regarding UFO reporting from K Apr 55 (Florida). No one went out and investigated the area. The report was taken completely over the phone. They did not go out and investigate because the person calling to report there were no impressions of any sort. Did not leave any trace on the ground. They did not check for radio activity. The road is sparsely traveled, several road. Farm road. Nothing was on radar. No witness. The person who claimed object bounced completely collapsed. He had heard about weird sightings before but never believed in them. None others occurred.
