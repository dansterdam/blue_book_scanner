CONCLUSION
STARS/PLANETS
Probable identification appears consistent with meteors or fireworks. Vertical motion and observations too brief for definitive determination.

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The objects observed appeared to be several in number. One seemed rather larger than others. They were yellow-white in color, rapidly moving, and appeared to be falling to Earth. Several seconds' observation duration was too brief for definitive determination. Observation dismissed as possibly meteors or fireworks.
