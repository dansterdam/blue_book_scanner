The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

CASE No. 10481 - 
LOCATION: Dayton, Ohio
DATE-TIME GROUP: 7 July 1968 - 2235 PM

The witness observed a light that appeared to be a very bright star in the southwest. The light was hovering and seemed to be stationary. After about 5 minutes, the light moved slowly to the east and then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. The witness described the object as round and about 4-5 times the size of a star. No sound was heard. The witness estimated the object was at an elevation of 20-30 degrees above the horizon.
