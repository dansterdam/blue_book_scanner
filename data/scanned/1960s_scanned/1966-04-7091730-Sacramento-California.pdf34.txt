The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object did not disappear. It simply went out of sight. I waited until it disappeared from sight.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.
The object did not move behind anything that I could observe.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.
The object did go in front of a cloud at one point, but I couldn't make out any details.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - None
b. Color - White

18. We wish to know the angular size: Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Captain 3 out of 4 inch

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow to indicate the direction the object was moving.
The drawing shows an elongated oval shape with no other details.
