The image shows a handwritten document from what appears to be a UFO report. There is no photograph present in the image.

The text of the document is as follows:

"This is a report on an object seen at 9:30 on 07 Oct 1968.

This object was seen to the West at the horizon side. At first it looked to be a round star but suddenly a bright light flashed and then began moving fast to the west. It would stop and hover then move on. It did this for several minutes. Then it just seemed to fade out.

There were 2 of us who saw this and we are both certain of what we saw. One man said it looked to have a glow around it tho the light itself was bright and solid.
