The image does not contain any photographs, only a sketch or diagram. The sketch shows a diagram with various angles and measurements, as well as a compass rose. The text on the page instructs the viewer to imagine the object they saw, place an "A" on the curve to indicate where they first saw it, and place a "B" on the curve to show where they last saw it. It also asks the viewer to draw a picture to show the motion of the object or objects.

Text extracted from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the curve to show where you last saw the object.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
