STATEMENT OF TECHNICAL SERGEANT WILLIAM L. TILDEN, USAF
MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, NORTH DAKOTA

On 7 October 1968, I was on duty as NCO in charge of the 5th Munitions Maintenance Squadron at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota. At approximately 2300 hours, I observed a bright, bluish-white light in the southwestern sky over the Sundre Range. The light was definitely not an aircraft or satellite. It remained stationary for a period of approximately 10-15 minutes, then suddenly moved rapidly in a horizontal direction to the east, stopped abruptly, and then moved rapidly back to its original position. The light then hovered for a short time and finally disappeared.

I immediately notified the Command Post and the Security Police of my observation. I was instructed to continue observing the light and to report any further developments. The light was observed by several other persons on the base, including the Security Police. The Weather Flight was notified and they reported no unusual weather conditions or phenomena that could account for the light.

I am a trained and experienced observer, having served in the Air Force for over 15 years. I have observed many aircraft, satellites, and other normal aerial phenomena, and I can state with certainty that the light I observed on 7 October 1968 was not any known or conventional aerial object. It displayed movement and behavior patterns that are consistent with reports of unidentified flying objects.
