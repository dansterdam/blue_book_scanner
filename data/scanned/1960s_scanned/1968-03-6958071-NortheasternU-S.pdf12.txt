The image contains a compass-like diagram with directional labels and two sketches depicting landscapes. The first sketch shows a landscape with a long horizontal horizon line, while the second sketch shows a view of distant mountains or hills.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POSITION OF THE WITNESS WHEN LAST SEEN. MARK ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT WHEN LAST SEEN. SHARPLY IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE, AND A SKETCH OF THE TERRAIN SCENE OR SCENERY AT THAT POSITION.

IN THE SKETCH OF COMPASS PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A Y AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW A STRAIGHT LINE, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, APPEAR TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
