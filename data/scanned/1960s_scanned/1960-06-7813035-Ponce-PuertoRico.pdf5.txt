SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Puerto Rico, Mr H. I. Morrow

TO: SAFOI-3d (1/Col Tacker)

1. Mr. and his wife and friends were observing the planet Venus. The planet was 75 removed from the sun in a westward direction, and was of magnitude -3.4 on 1 June 1960.

2. It is a new and novel experience for people to see planets in the day time, and few people realize it can be done without a telescope.

3. It is probable that Mr. experience that the object was spinning was due to prolonged staring at the undulately object so very near to the bright sun.

4. It is quite understandable that the planet was lost to the witnesses after a long period of staring at such a bright area. The planet was still there and the witnesses had allowed their eyes sufficient rest so they would have again been able to pick out the object.
