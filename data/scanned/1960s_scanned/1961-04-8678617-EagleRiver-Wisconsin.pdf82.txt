Cake From Flying Saucer
EAGLE RIVER, Wis. - A 58-year-old plumber of Eagle River, Dane Simonton, related Sunday that a flying saucer carrying a baked cake landed on his property on Sunday that a flying saucer carrying a baked cake landed on his property on Sunday. 
He only said that, said Joe Simonton, the cake's discoverer. A flying saucer came down in his yard Sunday and a hatch opened in the middle of the saucer. A short, dark-complected man emerged, handed Simonton a round, flat cake and motioned for water. Simonton said he gave the man a pitcher of water and in return the man handed him the cake and then took off, ascending over the ground instead of straight up.
The cake, Simonton said, was about 9 inches in diameter, one-half to three-quarters of an inch thick and appeared to be a pancake. There was no odor to it, he said, and it tasted like a wafer. It crumbled easily and had small holes in it, similar to a honey-comb. Simonton's story was told to County Judge Frank Carter, who urged him to get in touch with Air Force authorities, which Simonton said he would do.
