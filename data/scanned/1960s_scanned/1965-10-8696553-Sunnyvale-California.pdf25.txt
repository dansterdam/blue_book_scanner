Oct 25,1965

Dear folks,  
The incident which occurred on Friday evening is not fully understood and requires additional investigation on our part. I will summarize the details which have come to my attention so far:

On the evening of September 3, 1965, a man residing in Sunnyvale, California, reported sighting an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky. The object was described as being circular in shape, approximately 50 to 100 feet in diameter, and emitting a red glow. It was observed for several minutes before it rapidly climbed into the sky and disappeared. 

Later that night, the same witness reported hearing a loud explosion or sonic boom. Immediately following this, his home and the surrounding area experienced a brief power failure lasting approximately 5 to 10 minutes.

The witness also reported that over the next several days, he and his family experienced unusual physical symptoms, including nausea, headaches, and a tingling sensation across their bodies. Additionally, a small burn mark was found on the witness's arm that he could not account for.

We are continuing to investigate this incident and are attempting to gather any additional information that may be relevant. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can provide.

Sincerely,
