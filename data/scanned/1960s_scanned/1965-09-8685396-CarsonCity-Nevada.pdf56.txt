The image appears to be a cartoon-style illustration of a flying saucer or UFO in the sky, with a person speaking from the UFO saying "I'm sure I saw some people down there!", and another response saying "You aren't going to start those rumors again are you?"

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is:

U. F. O. 
"I'M SURE 
I SAW SOME
PEOPLE DOWN 
THERE!..."

"YOU AREN'T 
GOING TO START
THOSE RUMORS AGAIN
ARE YOU ?"
