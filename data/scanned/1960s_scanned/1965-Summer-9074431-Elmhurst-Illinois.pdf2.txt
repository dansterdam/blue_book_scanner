The handwritten text is as follows:

"The first thing I noticed when I entered the house was the TV was going off and on. Then as I was leaving I saw a light in the sky over my house. It didn't appear to be very high up. Then it slowly started to descend. Then a cloud came and the light disappeared. Then it went out again, only it was moving. The light started getting wider and the was shaking from side to side. Then it glowed a little brighter again, and the TV came on briefly before the light went away."
