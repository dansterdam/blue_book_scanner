Extremely frightened in car, thought it was an atomic bomb and could hardly drive. Eyes blinding and could barely see. Have told many people since, but no one believes me. They think I am making it up. But I know what I saw and it was very real to me. I have always been interested in flying saucers and other strange things in the sky.

Last night, reporting to you
