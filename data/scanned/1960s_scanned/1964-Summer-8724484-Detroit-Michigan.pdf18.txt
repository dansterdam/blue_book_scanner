Received on June 2n by 1950 by Project Blue Book:

We have further information about the phone call pilot. NO PILOT has made a sensational saucer sighting. This incident is described on Page 20 of the September 1964 SOLDIER NEWS. According to a representative of the Chill Roberts Air Co. of the 319th Squadron of the Strategic Air Command, stationed at homestead Air Force Base in Homestead, Florida, a Tighter of inquiry written by Unites, was to the effect that no such person existed, and thus the incident can be written off as a hoax.
