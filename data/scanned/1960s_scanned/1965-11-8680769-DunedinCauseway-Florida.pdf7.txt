The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a news release document from the United States Air Force. The document appears to be describing "chemical trails" that were visible in the sky around the sunset hours and were made by vertical probe research rockets launched by the Air Proving Ground Center. The document mentions that scientists around the world study the effect of the sun on the ionosphere, a part of the atmosphere starting about 40 miles above the earth's surface, and that the chemical trails were visible from Miami, Florida to Texas.

EGLIN AFB, FLA., NOV 15--CHEMICAL TRAILS--Chemical trails such as these have been creating quite a stir during the past few days throughout the southeastern part of the United States. The trails were visible in the sky around the sunset hours and were made by vertical probe research rockets launched by the Air Proving Ground Center here. The rocket firings were made in conjunction with the International Quiet Sun Year (IQSY) program. It is during this time that scientists around the world study the effect of the sun on the ionosphere, a part of the atmosphere starting about 40 miles above the earth's surface and reaching to about 500 miles. The chemical trails were visible from Miami, FLA., to Texas.
