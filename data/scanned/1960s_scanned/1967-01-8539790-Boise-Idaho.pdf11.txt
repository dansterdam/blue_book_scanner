PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 67-22

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: BOISE, IDAHO
DATE: 18 Jan 67

PHOTOGRAPHY: 
AF: - IR: - QUALITY: Poor
PMS: 1 Polaroid Print (B&W)

1. PURPOSE: This report is in answer to Work Order Number 67-31 which relates to a request submitted by Radio Correspondent KBPR, to determine the identity of the object photographed.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the submitted Polaroid-type print has negated retouching, and as the object is the only item appearing in the photograph, it could not be determined whether an aircraft or automobile was present. The photography appears genuine in all respects.

The object appears to be circular in platform, basically flat in cross-section with some degree of high lighting along the domed "superstructure". Source related that the photograph was taken at night under clear skies. The object possesses a small degree of high lighting along the domed "superstructure" and the background as it appears lifelike. An examination of the photograph appears dark with the exception of the top portion which exhibits a small degree of luminosity. The object is located within this anomaly and its background is "superstructure". As described did not warrant that the object be considered an artifice.
