PTD (TDSER)

2 August 1966

Mrs. [Redacted]
Sacramento, California 

Dear Mrs. [Redacted],

The phenomena which you have reported for 30 April 1966 has been discussed with the first Department at Wather AFB, California and they had no record of a fire on the evening of 30 April.

It appears that you observed a fuel testing which took place over the western part of Sacramento. This testing, which is routine, has been reported in the local press and it was not a fuel testing.

I wish to thank you for bringing the 30 April 1966 evaluation on your sightings to our attention.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
