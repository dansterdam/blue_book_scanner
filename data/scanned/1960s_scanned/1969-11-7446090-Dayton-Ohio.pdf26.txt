DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES NOVEMBER 10-16, 1969

The maps on this publication are prepared under the direction of the Superintendent, Environmental Data Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The map stations are shown as black dots, and are labeled with the state abbreviations. The contours show the height above sea level of the 500-millibar pressure surfaces, which indicate the general weather patterns. The solid lines represent heights in tens of meters. The dashed lines show the thickness between the 1000- and 500-millibar surfaces, and are labeled in decameters. This information is used to analyze temperature, moisture, and wind patterns. 

The weather map series includes maps for 7:00 A.M. and 7:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time each day. The 7:00 A.M. maps show the weather conditions prevailing at the beginning of each 24-hour period, and the 7:00 P.M. maps show the conditions 12 hours later. Small black figures are printed on the maps to indicate the temperatures, winds, and other weather data observed at the map stations. These data are coded according to internationally recognized weather observing and reporting practices.
