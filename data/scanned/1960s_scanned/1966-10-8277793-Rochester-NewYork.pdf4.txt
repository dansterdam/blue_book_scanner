Gentlemen:
My husband and I wish to report an unusual object over Rochester on the night of October 8.

My husband first sighted it overhead, moving in an easterly direction, about 8:40 p.m. It appeared "cigar-shaped" and white, similar to a star, but larger. He called my attention to it and my daughter and I also observed it. The change he said was in a general curve but remained overhead until it disappeared over the northern horizon. (about 9:45)

We would be much obliged if you could give us information as to what this object could be accounted for in a usual way as the object seemed to be moving at a speed and in a manner unusual to any aircraft. My husband is an engineer with Xerox, and was an Air Force Reserve Captain previously - a teacher in the Rochester school system. He realizes this is not a great deal of information, but it will fill in somewhere with other reports you may hold.

Yours truly yours,
