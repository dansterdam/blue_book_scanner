There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

Text from the document:

I took big spotlight off my car, started flashing light again. I soon realized (thot I could think of) that anyone might understand (something like this "sai") who I had flashed a few times (precise data in the account). I soon realized the object seemed to start illumination or its surface, various intensity - though I can't remember. Object hovered away, well, I don't remember how, but it is in my opinion it could not have been over 40 seconds, if my memory serves me). Then it continued on former course with a peculiar motion, indicaters for some moments, lost to sight.

NOTE: Approach of object from NW horizon apparently much faster (angular) than the rest of the course. In other words, it travelled generally "slower" after the first "hover".

I honestly doubt that the two fellows in the red car had anything to do with this incident - it is just difficult to imagine anyone there else so strangely. (Really - it probably scared the "dickens" out of them - it almost ID"ED with A FRIEND). (Never told but a few people certainly did not dare tell the news media about it, he said, "Well, I don't know what it was, but it SURE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF L.B.J. RANCH!" (A subjective guess, not knowing the distance.)
