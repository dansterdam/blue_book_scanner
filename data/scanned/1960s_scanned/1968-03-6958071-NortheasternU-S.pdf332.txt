AF Identifies UFO's
An Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon disclosed today that the Air Force has identified three objects sighted over the Washington area on Sunday as air force aircraft. Sightings were made in a widely-spaced area of the sky but all three objects were identified as air force planes. The spokesman said the Air Force is conducting an investigation to determine why the objects were mistaken for unidentified flying objects. The sightings occurred between 8:30 p.m. and midnight Sunday, he said.
