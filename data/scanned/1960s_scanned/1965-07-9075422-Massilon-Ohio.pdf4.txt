"  13 July 1965
The Akron Canton Reppoct is approkimately 15 miles from here and the planes ofteng come over the house.  On the night of July the phone was ringing and the object was about as high as a plane is usually.   It was round and quite large and was there for several minutes.  I would say it was very high and quite bright."
