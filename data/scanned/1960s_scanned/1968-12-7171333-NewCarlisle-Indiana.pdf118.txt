STRANGE LIGHTS SEEN IN THE WESTFJORDS AREA

Of late there have been seen, three times, strange lights in the sky over the southern part of the Westfjords area. According to the description, the light phenomenon was seen in the sky for one and a half hour in the evening of Monday last.

Thorður Jónsson said, that the light had also been seen from the village of Hólmavík over the mountains. At first the light was small, but it gradually grew in size and brightness. It was hovering and moving slowly, sometimes faster. The light had a circular shape and seemed to be divided into sections. It was quite impossible that this could have been a star or any kind of natural formation as it was complex and multiform and of great brightness. The light was seen until it disappeared to the south.

When the light was seen from Hoefell, it could be seen for about fifteen minutes. It was difficult to judge the distance, but the witnesses were sure it was rather close. The light was seen for one and a half hour from Ísafjörður. At that time, the sky was clear, but the light remained visible until it disappeared to the south, as the wind was blowing in that direction.

Kerlingardid discussed this with meteorologist Jens Jakobsson who said, that it is quite difficult to say what this light can be, but there is a great number of all kinds of phenomena in the sky, and the authorities believe in the probability that it was some new phenomena, which is descending very slowly into the atmosphere, having completed its mission and gradually disappearing from the sight, such as the moon is not visible from the ground.
