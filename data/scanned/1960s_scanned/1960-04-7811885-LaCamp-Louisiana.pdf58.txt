A piece of supposed Bark and a Portion of supposed Tree Leaves Collected under cover of darkness 2 Mar 54.

This item was collected at the impact area considered 1/ the possible location of an unidentified Flying Object that crashed 13 April 1954.

Reason for collection and the basic description of the specimen is evidently because the leaves and bark were visually observed in the impact area. This is apparent from the spanish discourse on 4 Incidents related to this possible crash the evidently revealed by the USAF. This is related to AF Form 112 missing because the leaves and bark have already been shipped to rear area for analysis. It is not known if the analysis revealed anything significant.
