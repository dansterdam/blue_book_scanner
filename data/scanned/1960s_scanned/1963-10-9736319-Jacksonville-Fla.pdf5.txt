DISC SUBMERGED IN BRAZILIAN

say. If the disc sank through the water
and it is certain that it remained on the
bottom, then this case is more unusual for
it may have proceeded through the mud.
various types have been seen coming out
of the water, but no case is recorded of
one entering the water and remaining
there. It must be considered as a very
unusual incident which is pretty well substantiated as happening, but the details
are lacking. Although some detectors were used and
the possibility of a hoax was denied, there
is no way of knowing for sure that some
device was not used to simulate the sinking of the disc. So if we accept this as
case of any kind, not even the location
of the other sightings are conclusive as to the nature of the incident. The
fact is, that after hitting the water, the
disc, after settling to the bottom, disappeared from view - no other details.
