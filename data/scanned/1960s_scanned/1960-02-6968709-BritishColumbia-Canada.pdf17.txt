Pt. 5

At about 2130 hours, while returning home, I
observed a brilliant white light in the sky. It appeared to
be about 45 degrees above the horizon and was slowly
moving westward. After watching it for several minutes,
I noticed that it appeared to split into two separate lights,
one larger than the other. These two lights began to move
erratically and dance around each other.

After watching this for a short while, the larger
light suddenly dimmed and appeared to descend rapidly.
The smaller light then began to move rapidly up and down
and from side to side. This continued for several more
minutes until the smaller light finally disappeared.

The whole incident lasted about 10 to 15 minutes.

This report has been handwritten on what appears to be an official form or document. The text appears to be a detailed description of a UFO sighting, likely part of the Project Blue Book reports.
