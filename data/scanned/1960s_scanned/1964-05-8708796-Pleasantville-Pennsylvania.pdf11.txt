The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing handwritten text.

The text on the page reads as follows:

5. The only other possible collaboration was a [REDACTED], who lives close by who said she saw a bright light in the sky but merely pulled down her shade. (A fine example of scientific curiosity)
6. [REDACTED] also indicated that when the light was closed to the car it was lower than the top of a telephone pole and seemed to be swooping down.
7. Unfortunately she was unable to couch anything in scientific terms. He used vague descriptions and was not precise as to the motions of the light. He was precise about the roads used and the distances his car traveled. It was clear from the conversation that he had been deeply moved by the experience. Also, that he didnot want any publicity since he isaware that it would due his reputation any good. He didn't talk about his experience with anyone for several months but finally was inadvertently put in touch with a man from NICAP. This sighting is now, therefore, in the NICAP files.
9. I think it might be worthwhile for me to talk with [REDACTED] also.
