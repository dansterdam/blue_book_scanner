23 Nov. 66

Contact was made with WP AFB operations regarding the observance of an alleged UFO over the Dayton area on 18 Nov. 66 at approx 5:10 PM. There were two aircraft which landed at the base shortly before the sighting as described. There was no traffic in the area at the time.

Description is inconsistent with that of an aircraft which would be in a slowly rising or a rapidly climbing situation. It is possible that the observed pattern both aircraft were of the DD-6 class.
