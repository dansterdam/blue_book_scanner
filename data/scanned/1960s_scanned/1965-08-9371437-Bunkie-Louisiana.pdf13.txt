The object(s) were observed for approximately 15-20 minutes and the observers were able to see the object(s) make several sudden turns and stops. The objects were also observed to change directions several times.

The temperature was approximately 65 degrees and the sky was clear. The observers could not hear any sound from the object(s). The object(s) appeared to be at a high altitude.

The observers stated they believe the object(s) were under intelligent control, but could not determine if the object(s) were craft or simply lights.
