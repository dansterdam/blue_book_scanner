The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing an investigation of some sort of unidentified flying object.

We, they also stated investigate
all the reports of the incident, and
this is not the first one of this kind.
A friend of mine who also
lives in Beverly Shores was
over last evening - and pie has
been ill to even ride on evening
recently when he went out to her
coal-fried to get some coal, and
when he got back to the house
he had trouble with one electric
shock as he touched a "flowing
Saucer" wire a, red-capilliabed
over it. Immediately she touched
a wire which was hanging in the
air from the "Flowing Saucer"
above her, and it gave her an
electric shock.
There were none yet good,
and I hope it, not good,
got Jen, kid none in that condition.
