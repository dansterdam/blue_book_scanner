There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet containing a form with fields for name, signature, and date, as well as a handwritten text describing the details of an observation.

U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and used as accurately as possible, please use the following spaces to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may go into past information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and do say further comments, observations, or sketches that you believe are pertinent. This will present the details of the observation as they occurred. Additional pages of the same size may be attached if they are needed.

[Handwritten text]
If there are sightings of the same type of object at the same time by several people, I would like to know the number of witnesses, their approximate locations, and their descriptions of the object. Could you give a geographical description of the area and time of day? I would also be interested in knowing if any other unusual activity was observed, either in the sky or on the ground.
