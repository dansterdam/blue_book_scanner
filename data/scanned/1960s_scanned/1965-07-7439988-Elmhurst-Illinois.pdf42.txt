The text of the document is as follows:

At 11:00 p.m. on 30 July people leaving a movie theater in Cumana, Venezuela, saw a luminous object flying over the area in an east to west direction. It gave off yellow-white lights and appeared to be spinning rapidly, also emitting flames. The same or a similar object was seen crossing the sky over Lecherias, a town some 60 miles from Cumana, in Anzoategui State.
