seemed to be a beam that came from the lower middle portion of the light down to the car; the beam was of a whiter nature.she if you know what I mean.

H - Did it appear as though the beam was directed at the car?

J That was the impression that I got. Now, here again, I was, I guess, so frightened that it's hard to distinguish exactly what was happening, but this is the impression that I got, that the beam was shined down to the car.

H Now, at the time, were there any other cars on the road?

J No sir, there was not. This, too, is something that is kind of interesting because I've been by that particular place several times since and there's always a car either in sight behind me or in front of me, but on this particular night there was none.

H Let me ask you about the brightness. How would you compare it, to say, a street light a block away, or how close would you have to hold a flashlight to your eyes to have it appear the same brightness?

J Well, now the brightness is kind of very interesting in that it lit up the road and the ditches and, you know, the trees on the sides of the road, yet I could look directly at it and it didn't hurt my eyes.

H I see.

J It was light enough to light up the area, but yet it was not bright enough to be harmful to my eyesight.

H Was that, was the beam that was projected from it, brighter or dimmer than the main body?

J The beam, I don't know, it was kind of strange; I wasn't actually looking directly into the beam. The beam seemed to be coming a little below my eye level.
