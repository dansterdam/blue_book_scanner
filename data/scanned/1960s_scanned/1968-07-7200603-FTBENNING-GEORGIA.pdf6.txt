The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

COMMENTS: Possible lightning passing from cloud to cloud and appearing from the ground to be a bright oval light moving at a rapid speed. Low vibrant cloud formations could give the effect of flashing rays and a star-like effect of flashing rays.

Observer disregarded above possibility, saying it lacked to long, was too bright, and maintained a constant configuration.
