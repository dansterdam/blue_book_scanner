On 5 March 1960 an additional unidentified object was reported in the Nome, Alaska area. According to the report, the object was white in color and moving at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for 7 to 10 minutes. Ground radar tracked the object, which was confirmed by pilot visual observation. The object appeared to be under intelligent control.

The initial press inquiry on this incident was answered by an Air Force spokesman stating that the object was probably a "natural phenomenon" and that the Air Force had no information indicating the presence of any unidentified flying object in the Nome area.
