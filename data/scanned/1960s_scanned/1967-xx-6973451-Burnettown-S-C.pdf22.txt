The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It seems to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, likely documenting a UFO sighting incident.

1. "AT APPROXIMATELY 8:00 P.M. ON 23 NOV 67, THE WITNESS CALLED TO REPORT THAT THEY HAD OBSERVED A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SKY NEAR BURNETTOWN, S.C. ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, THE OBJECT WAS STATIONARY IN THE SKY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN SUDDENLY TOOK OFF AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE, OF A BRIGHT ORANGE-RED COLOR, AND GAVE OFF A PULSATING LIGHT. WITNESSES STATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS EXTREMELY BRIGHT AND APPEARED TO BE ILLUMINATING THE SURROUNDING AREA."

EVALUATIONS:
Witness: There is no previous evidence to indicate that the witness has fabricated or misrepresented what he has seen. There is no indication to the contrary.

Daytime: The sighting did occur during darkness.

Rockdale: The U.S. Coast Guard Helicopter was seen by the witness and appears to be unrelated to the UFO sighting.

CONCLUSION: Due to the lack of data (photographs/drawings) and the generally unsubstantiated nature of the report, no conclusion can be drawn other than that the witness observed an unidentified aerial phenomenon. Further investigative data is required.
