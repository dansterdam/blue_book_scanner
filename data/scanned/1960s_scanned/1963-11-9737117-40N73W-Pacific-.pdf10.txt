Strange Object In Sky Remains A Mystery
The unidentified flying object observed by several U.S. Army personnel Tuesday still remains a mystery. The object, observed for some 45 minutes, hovered in the sky over the area and then moved off in the direction of the northwest, finally disappearing from view into the heavens.
At least four persons kept the object under observation and watched as it moved and hovered in the sky. All were unable to identify the object and described it as bright and flickering. It did not appear to be any conventional aircraft, they said.
Col. Cale E. Mc Henry, Commanding Officer of the Nearby U.S. Army installation, said his office had been notified of the incident and that they were investigating. He said that officials from the Army and the Air Force, and other military personnel had observed the object. He said it remained unexplained as yet.
It was reported that other installations in the area had also reported observing the mysterious object in the sky, but as yet no official explanation has been given for the sighting.
