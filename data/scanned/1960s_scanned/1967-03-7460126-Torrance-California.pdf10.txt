It appeared at first to be static or hovering and then moved in an erratic manner, eventually moving off at a high rate of speed. When it was a close up, one observer noted portholes that were slit-like in appearance and could see indistinguishable forms within which appeared humanoid in shape. this at a distance of about 500 yards, the sighting occurred at about 10:10 pm on the 7th of March 1967 in Torrance, California. The object was directly overhead and continued on a westerly direction at a high rate of speed, disappearing from sight within about 60 seconds. No noise whatsoever was detected during the sighting. The observation lasted approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds.
