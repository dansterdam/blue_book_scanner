The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document dated October 15, 1963, and is titled "FLYING SAUCER REVIEW". The page contains a report on an "Alarm in Ecuador", describing sightings of hundreds of saucers flying overhead and a large population watching a "luminous object" climbing up the volcano Recu Pichincha near Quito. The report mentions photographs, reporters, and many witnesses being present for the event.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Alarm in Ecuador

The governments of some of the smaller states are no longer ruling their fears that as invasion is imminent. Only the other day we had the scene of "Alarm, panic and commotion". (Noticias, Argentinas, Oct. 18). The towns of Quito and its environs, Ecuador, were the scene of the happening. Hundreds of saucers flying overhead, and an announcement on channel 6 of the local radio, that the population was at that moment watching a luminous object, certainly not a satellite, as it appeared to climb the volcano Recu Pichincha, east of Quito. Photographers, reporters, and many sighs netters were on the scene.
