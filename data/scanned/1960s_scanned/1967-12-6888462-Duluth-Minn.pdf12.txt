Many irregularly shaped, bluish-white lights moving slowly, changing course and altitude. At one point a group of 5 or 6 lights were hovering in one spot for several minutes before moving away again. The lights appeared to be larger than stars. They appeared to be about the size of an automobile headlight at a distance, though the actual size and distance could not be determined. The lights were brighter than the surrounding stars and moonlight made it difficult to determine the exact color, though they appeared bluish-white. The lights moved slowly and silently, unlike any airplane or other known aircraft.
