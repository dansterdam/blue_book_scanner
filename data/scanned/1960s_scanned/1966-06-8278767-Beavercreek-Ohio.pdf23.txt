There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads:

"No case info only
Proposed reply to letter from -----, 21 March 1967

Dear -----,
Reference your recent letter reporting an unidentified flying object observation on last summer. At this late date, it would be extremely difficult to make a comprehensive evaluation of the sighting. It is most important that we receive the reports at the earliest possible date.
The only possible explanation that I could give at this time would be that the sighting has the characteristics of an aircraft traveling machine. Such traveling exercises have been responsible for numerous UFO sightings in the past.
Enclosed is some information which should be of interest.
