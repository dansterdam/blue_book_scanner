6. Britton-Thornton. At 2105 hours on 23 May 1964, a Corporal Thornton at the Michigan State Police Headquarters, East Lansing, Michigan, received a call from a woman who said an object (a light) was hovering over her house, "acting crazy," dashing back and forth and looping about. Since the Corporal recognized her given location as being near the police station, he went out the rear entrance and looked to the south, but saw nothing. He did not log the name of the lady, nor does he remember it. After terminating the call, he went back outside, and while looking due south, saw an extremely brilliant white object pass at an elevation of about 20Â° in a horizontal path from east to west. The object was apparently longer in the north-south dimension than in the east-west direction; its shortest dimension was in the direction of travel. Thornton estimates the length to width ratio as perhaps three or four to one. The longest dimension was given as approximately 3/4 inch at arm's length (the moon, however, was stated to be "6 inches" in diameter at arm's length when full, although it was not noticed that night).

The total time of travel was about three seconds. The brightness of the object is remembered as steady, brighter than Venus, and before the object reached the horizon to the south-west, it winked out suddenly, as if someone had turned the lights off. The start of the trajectory is not known, as Thornton caught sight of the object to the south while it was approximately at its maximum elevation.
There was no sound.

Thornton returned inside and got another trooper, who came out but saw nothing.
