The image appears to contain a diagram with a compass and instructions for sketching the observed position and motion of UFO objects. There is no photographic image present in this particular page of the document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the object when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the object where you saw it last. Place an arrow to show the course it took. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
