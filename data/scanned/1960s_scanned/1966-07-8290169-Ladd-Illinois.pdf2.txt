35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your experience:
A plane was passing over, like that of before. The approach came down lower and lower, then it leveled off at a steady altitude. An unusual light came on the plane, more like a very bright light, but it did not seem to be a flashing light typical of aircraft. After a little while, it went out and the plane continued on its course. I had just started outside when I first noticed the plane. I had to believe that whatever was seen was a feature of the craft itself and not a reflection or effect caused by something outside the plane. For what reason it was done, I do not know, but it did not seem to be a normal function of a plane as I am acquainted with them. I noted that the light did not seem to be connected to the normal running lights of the plane. It appeared to be a different light altogether and gave no blinking signal. It was a steady bright light that came on and then went out after a short interval. I believe that whatever caused this light was an unusual feature of the aircraft and not something normal. I have no explanation for what I saw.
