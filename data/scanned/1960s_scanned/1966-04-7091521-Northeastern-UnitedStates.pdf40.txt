The Great Bolide of April 25, 1966

CHARLES F. OLIVIER, Director, American Meteor Society

On the above date, at 7:14 p.m. Eastern standard time, a very brilliant meteor was observed traversing the skies over a wide area of the Northeastern United States, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. This bolide showed the moon, giving a good position of the horizon and the general direction of motion. The bolide showed up very well against the twilight sky, and was visible for a rather long time, perhaps 10 to 15 seconds, as it moved slowly. It finally broke into fragments and disappeared.

Immediate steps were taken to collect all available data on this event. Numerous reports were received from observers in the area, and a number of these were published in the Washington Evening Star, which then stimulated further reports. These reports, as well as some unpublished material, have been assembled, and the results are presented in this article, while the Flower and Cook Observatory data are included in the table below.

The time of the event, as determined from the various accounts used in this article, was 7:14 p.m., Eastern standard time, or 0014 Universal Time. The bolide was seen by a large number, as did the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP).

In all, about 500 reports were assembled, containing very valuable information on the motion, brightness, duration, color, and other features of this bolide. However, as is usually the case, enough data were not collected to permit a complete analysis and calculation of the orbit, because of the lack of accurate attitudes and azimuths from the observers. But the general direction and path of this bolide can be determined with a fair degree of accuracy.

The principal features of the bolide, as determined from the data collected, are:
