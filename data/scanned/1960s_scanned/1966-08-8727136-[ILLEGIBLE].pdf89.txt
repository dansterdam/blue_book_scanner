The image contains a sketch and diagram, but no photograph. The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" and "B" on the time line to show when you first and last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture showing the path, or trail, of the object or objects made. Place a "T" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 1, 2 or more. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
