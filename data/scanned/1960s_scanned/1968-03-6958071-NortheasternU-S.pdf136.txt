Flaming Objects Seen, Many Traced to a Soviet Space Shot
By WALTER SULLIVAN

At about 9:45 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on March 6, a woman in Ravenna, Ohio, looked through her kitchen window and saw a procession of fiery objects fly past. In about two minutes there were half a dozen or more, she told the United States Air Force.
"Two or three minutes later," she reported to her United States Air Force base, "my cousin, my aunt and my husband came running into the house telling me to come out and see the U.F.O.'s (unidentified flying objects) they had just seen."
It was at an altitude of about 30,000 feet, she said, and was seen very clearly across the sky, going very fast and in a straight line. All of the observers agreed that it was no aircraft they had ever seen before. They could distinguish no wings, it was on fire both in front and behind, and it seemed to leave a trail of sparks, she said.
A woman in Ohio told how she saw the U.F.O.'s pass over, had lain between trash cans in her driveway and had been "frightened to death." 
In Tennessee, a woman said she had "an overpowering drive to stand" and watched a U.F.O. in 1956. In Tennessee, a woman was reported as sighting a U.F.O. in 1956.
