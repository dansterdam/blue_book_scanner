There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing a questionnaire or form with various questions about the observed object.

Text extracted from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, it just disappeared, which block out the object.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes
No
Don't Know. 
IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes
No
Don't Know. 
IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Noise
b. Color: Gray-Blue

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About the same size as a quarter/silver dollar (size of match head ratio)

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
Sketch shows an irregularly shaped object, with no other specific details.
