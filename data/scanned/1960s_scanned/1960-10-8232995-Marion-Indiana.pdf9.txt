The image contains two sketch diagrams. The top diagram shows a curved line with an object above the horizon line, and the bottom diagram shows two sketches of a landscape with the horizon and an object in the distance.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position of the object when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position of the object when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch on an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
