The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The text on the page contains questions and instructions related to describing and drawing an observed UFO sighting.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on the path, a "B" at the start of the path, and show any change in direction during the sighting. 

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object of known size near the object. If you had performed this measure, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?  

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance.
