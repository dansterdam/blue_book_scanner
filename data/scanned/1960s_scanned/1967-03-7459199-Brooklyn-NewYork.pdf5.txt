Brooklyn March 16, 1967

Commander Stewart
Air Force Base 
New York-12554

Dear Sirs:

According to one of the latest issues of "Flying Saucers" I found on page 62 a sumnary of the United States Air Force which says ........... things which are with all probability the so called UFO phenomena, I dont use the official US Air Force UFO write down what I have. 

On March 11 Saturday in the afternoon I was with the huny line from Shore Road (Brooklyn) along 4 to 5th Avenue in Southbrooklyn.I descended near the 23 d Street and began to walk home along the Berean the walk and 5th Avenue).It was about 4:45 when I walked close to the playground. Between 5th and 4th Avenue that spot I had a good straight way (Arbeidsk) to the west of the playground. 
Once the object once noticed in a big reddish. object in this direction South-west under the angle about 30 with a so line among the clouds (scattered clouds)-the dim disc sun was at the left of the object. This object looked big (somewhat smaller than a full moon). This object penetrated top and clearly contours-with the top inclined to the west-it had the reanre of a big bell-like color-was "dim red". The following:If You take an open umbrella (with prolonged like a bell) and put it in the distance of about 15-20 in front of you-it was the size of this enormous dim-red among the clouds. But some inches to the right side of the object I noticed a small one-round bright as a fruit (seen in the distance of 15-20 yards from you)-disappeared.
