JAMAICA:
Many visits
Some of the accounts that have been received from Jamaica
indicate a large number of unidentified flying objects have
been reported over that island during recent months. The
reports indicate that the sightings are not confined to any
one section but are scattered over the entire island.
One of the contributors, writing from Mandeville, states that
on several occasions he has seen UFO's over that town. On
one occasion, he reports, a bright white light, much brighter
than he could account for as an aircraft, was observed hover-
ing in the sky for approximately 30 minutes. The object was
estimated to be about 45 to 50 feet in diameter. On other
occasions, discs and other types of UFOs have been sighted.
Another observer, writing from Montego Bay, states that he
and his wife were awakened one night about 12:30 a.m. by a
brilliant light shining through their bedroom window. They
observed a large, brilliantly lighted object hovering about
200 feet above the ground. It remained in view for about 15
minutes and then suddenly shot upward at a terrific speed
and disappeared. The witness states that the object appeared
to be approximately 75 to 100 feet in diameter.
It would appear from these and other reports received that
Jamaica is experiencing an unusually high incidence of UFO
sightings at the present time. The reports received indicate
that the objects being observed are of several different types
and sizes, but all apparently are displaying characteristics
that clearly distinguish them from known aircraft or other
conventional aerial objects.
