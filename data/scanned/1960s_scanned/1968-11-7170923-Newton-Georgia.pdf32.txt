There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document, containing a transcript of a conversation between two individuals, referred to as "H" and "J".

The transcript of the text found in the document is as follows:

Well, it appeared to be very close. I've always said in all of these reports between 50 to 75feet in front of me and approximately the same distance from the ground.

One other way of looking at this, the trees that were lighted up we could measure and find out which tree was the most brightly lighted and get the distance that way. Were the trees right to the side or you or to the front of you most

There were in the front of me that . . the trees that were brightest lighted were a little to the front and, of course, to the left and right of the road.

Is it a fairly thickly wooded area where you were going through?

Yes sir, actually this whole creek bottom that is very thickly wooded and then, of course, I had just passed this area and there is land, just recently, I would say in the last 3 to 5 years, broken up into farm land.

Where are the, how close are the nearest houses?

Approximately a mile to two miles.

I see, so it's not exactly a populated area?

No sir, it's very sparsely populated.

Was there much wind that night, I don't know that that makes any difference.

As far as I can recall, Dr. Hynek, there was no wind hardly at all, to speak of.

Okay. I don't know which questions are the important ones to ask, but I try to get as complete a picture. Is there anything you feel you could add now, or, now that you've had some time to think about this whole thing, how does it appear to you today? You're apparently just as puzzled, but
