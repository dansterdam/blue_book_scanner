The image appears to contain two sketches or diagrams. The larger sketch on the left shows a series of wavy, curved lines that could potentially represent contour lines or some kind of terrain or landscape. The smaller sketch on the right appears to show a more geometric, abstract pattern of shapes and lines.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and extract the text from the document:
