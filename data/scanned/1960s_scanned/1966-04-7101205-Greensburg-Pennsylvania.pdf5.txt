The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch shows an angled view of an object in the sky, along with an illustration of a compass.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve where you last saw the object.
Place a "C" on the scale to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "D" on the scale where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
