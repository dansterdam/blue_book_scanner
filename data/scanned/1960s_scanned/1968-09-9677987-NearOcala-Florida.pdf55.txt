There does not appear to be a photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document. The image shows a typed text document describing a reported UFO sighting event.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

As I gather, the only thing he saw was a light, not an object.

Right, he saw the light. 

I've forgotten now what color he described that. Did he describe color or changes of color, do you recollect?

It seems that there wasn't too much shape to it; it was larger than a beacon light, or something like that. I don't remember now just what color, but it seems that possibly once he mentioned a different color, but normally it seems like it was a pale white light, I believe.

Now, let me get this sequence straight, and check me on this. Who saw what first? There are two avenues of approach here. They saw something and almost simultaneously, or a little before that, did the radar pickup something following them?

No sir. We didn't have any radar pickup until quite a way down in the sequence.

I see. The time-motion sequence, then....perhaps you'd better tell me. What happened first?

To the best I can remember, first of all, they contacted the people that were controlling them. That probably would have been Jacksonville Center or somewhere down in there.
