At approximately 6:30 PM EST this day I sighted what is termed a flying saucer at approximately a 130' angle in the sky. It was about the size of a quarter but when spied through 4x10 binoculars it appeared cigar shaped approximately one foot long and seemed to give off a glow very unlike a star. It remained in the sky for about 20 minutes and then disappeared behind some trees. Can you tell me what it was?
