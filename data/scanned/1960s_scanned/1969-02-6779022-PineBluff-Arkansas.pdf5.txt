This image contains two photographs. The larger one depicts a compass rose with directions labeled around the perimeter. The smaller photographs on the bottom show landscape scenes with figures in the distance.

G.A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "P" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

REFER TO THE SKETCH BELOW. PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW A LINE TO SHOW WHETHER THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
