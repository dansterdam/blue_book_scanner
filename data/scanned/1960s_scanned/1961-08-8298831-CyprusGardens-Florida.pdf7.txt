Also, in an interview, Mrs. O'Kane, aged approximately 70 years of ago, of Yeppoon, Queensland, reported hearing a loud roar like a jet plane and seeing a large, glowing, cigar-shaped object pass over her home, on a night in August, 1961. The object was traveling at a very high speed and gave off sparks as it passed. It came from the northwest and headed towards the southeast. There was no trail of smoke or vapor and the object made no noise. Mrs. O'Kane said it was very close to the ground and much larger than any ordinary aircraft. She was both startled and frightened by the experience and could not be persuaded to discuss it further. She wishes to remain anonymous and could not be prevailed upon to give her name. It is suggested that this sighting be looked into further if considered worthwhile.
