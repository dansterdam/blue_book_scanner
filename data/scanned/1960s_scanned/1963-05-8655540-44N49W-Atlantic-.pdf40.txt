Youth Chased By Fiery Object

On the night of 20 May 1962, a 17-year-old youth and some companions were driving in a car near Glencoe, Victoria, Australia. Near the Victoria bar, the group slowed down to let another car pass. As they did so, a bright light came on which was dazzling and the youth man stopped the car to find out what it was. The object then moved across the road and the boy started driving again, speeding up. Then the light shot up in the air and went out of sight. Although it was going 50 or 60 miles per hour, the light followed the car. It was as bright as a welder's arc. The youth said, "The boy's father, who reported the incident, said that the boy arrived home nervous, upset and frightened."
A local press report said that a similar object was sighted by 4 other people on the same night, at about 10 p.m. Gawler police were asked to investigate. The people claimed the light, which turned from red to white, followed the car for about 15 miles.
