Dear Sirs:

This morning I saw what could have been a UFO and after contacting the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory they suggested I contact what I saw to you.

At around 4 A.M. I, and my two roommates, saw an extremely large bright light in the sky. We would say well out over the Atlantic Ocean. Occasionally the object would disappear and then reappear. We watched this object until dawn when it started moving away, getting smaller and smaller, but still clearly visible even in the daylight. 
It was moving in a southerly direction and finally became a point and was lost from sight within the hour.

We live in Malden, Mass. on the fourth floor of an apartment building and we have a good clear sweep of the sky. We understand it was not seen by Logan International Airport Observatory which we cannot understand because there it was, shooting off rays. I hope this is of some benefit to you.

Very truly yours,
