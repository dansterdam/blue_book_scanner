1. There is nothing in the data supplied by Mr. Quintanilla to indicate that this has been observed by astronomical personnel. The observer, he indicates, had the object under observation for approximately 30 minutes. He estimates the elevation as being approximately half-way to the zenith.

2. From the evidence presented by Mr. Quintanilla, this does not appear potentially profitable to pursue investigation of this case further, as the information seems inconclusive and cannot be oriented with known physical principles.
