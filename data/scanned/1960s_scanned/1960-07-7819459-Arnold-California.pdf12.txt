On July 12, 1947, about 3:00 pm, at a place near Mount Rainier, Washington, Mr. Kenneth Arnold, a business man of Boise, Idaho, reported that he saw a formation of nine shiny objects flying at a high rate of speed. He described them as being shaped like saucers and estimated that they were about 40-50 feet in diameter. He stated that they flew in a diagonal, chain-like line and that they appeared to weave in and out of the high rock peaks of the mountain. He estimated their speed to be between 1200 and 1700 miles per hour. Their flight path was from Mount Rainier to Mount Adams. Mr. Arnold stated that he had never seen anything like it before and could not offer an explanation as to what they were. This was one of the earliest and most publicized sightings of unidentified flying objects in the United States.
