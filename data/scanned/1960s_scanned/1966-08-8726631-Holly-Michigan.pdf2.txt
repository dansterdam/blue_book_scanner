30 Day November 1966 Year
Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or which you feel deserves explanation of your statement. They tell me they saw three objects come down from the sky (by coming down I mean going towards the horizon). The objects seemed to be flashing lights. At about 10 or 15 degrees above the horizon they stopped and seemed to be telling the truth. In the sky about 20 or 25 degrees above the horizon they were saying something. However, at one point it stopped pulsating - it seemed to be flat yellow light, bigger than the star. However, one moment it stopped pulsating - it seemed to be a flat yellow light, about the size of a star. Then it started pulsating again. This bright light has been known to move a great deal up and down and in a few minutes I noticed that it had moved a great deal down and up again. I just couldn't figure out how it could do that.
I just couldn't get a good fix on what the object looked like when the object was sighted. By using a star chart I found that the object, say 10:00 on the big dipper, was moving up and down. It will turn to the right, will not be seen for a time, and will turn to the left again. More detail would make it sound more accurate than they were.
