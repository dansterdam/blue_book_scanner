Back in northwestern U.S. at 10 p.m. on the 31st two teenagers at Edmps City, Washington sighted an unidentified object in the skies over the town. The object was reported to the local police, to whom the mother of one of the teenagers had in turn notified. A deputy said that the Othello Radar Base had identified but minor William Mauer, head of the Franklin County Civil Defense, was notified that a report was received. Mayor asked all Columbia Basin residents who sighted unidentified objects in the skies to get in touch with the Civil Defense office so an attempt can be made to trace them.
