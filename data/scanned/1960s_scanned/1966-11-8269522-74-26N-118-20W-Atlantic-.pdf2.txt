Captain Charles M. Metz
Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi
18 March 1967

Lt Colonel George P. Freeman, Jr.
Chief, Foreign Technology Division
Department of the Air Force
Washington D.C. 20330

Dear Colonel Freeman:

I am enclosing for not replying to your letter sooner, however, I am on an extended TDY and your letter just caught up with me. With regard to your questions relating to my observation of November 8, 1966, I was told by the debriefing officer immediately after that I was not submitting a full agreement with this observation and that I had not been aware that I had submitted a UFO report.

I agree fully with your conclusion that aircraft could have been responsible for this observation. This was my stated position in formation.

I hope this will clear up any questions you may have regarding this observation.

Sincerely,
(Signature)
Charles M. Metz
Captain, USAF
