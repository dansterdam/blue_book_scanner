The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. The text in the document is as follows:

The right approach to the subhect is that the seven people who witnessed the object are all responsible citizens and they all made their reports independently. Although the object seen by the different witnesses differed somewhat in details, the main facts corroborate. The object seen was metallic and disc-shaped. It hovered and then suddenly shot upwards at a terrific speed. The object was seen by several witnesses, some of whom were long-time residents of the area and who have never reported seeing anything like it before. The report states that the object was at no time visible for more than a few minutes at a time. The witnesses were impressed by the silence of the object and its maneuverability. Based on the reports, it would appear that the object was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known type of aircraft.
