BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
OVL SHAPED OBJECT SIGHTED APPROX. 20 DEG ABV HORIZON, 270 DEG AZ. OBJ REMAINED STATIONARY FOR 5 MINS THEN SHOT STRAIGHT UP OUT OF SIGHT VERY RAPIDLY. APPEARED RED/ORANGE IN COLOR.
EVALUATION: CASE CATEGORY: UNKNOWN - PROBABLY NATURAL
CONCLUSION: THIS APPEARS TO BE A NATURAL OCCURRENCE RATHER THAN A MAN MADE OR EXTRA TERRESTRIAL OBJECT. THE DESCRIPTION FITS THAT OF A LENTICULAR CLOUD WHICH CAN SOMETIMES BE MISTAKEN FOR A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SKY ESPECIALLY IF SIGHTED SUDDENLY MOVING OR CHANGING SHAPE WHICH IS TYPICAL BEHAVIOR OF THIS NATURAL PHENOMENON. THEREFORE IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THIS SIGHTING WAS CAUSED BY A NATURALLY OCCURRING LENTICULAR CLOUD.
