The image contains a photograph of a compass-like image with a sun or star-like symbol in the center. There is also a sketch showing the path of an object or objects in the sky, with instructions to indicate the motion and direction of the object(s).

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve or line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curve or line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

[Handwritten notes]:
Obj held a STEADY course
