The second sketch shows a larger view of the object's position, with a sketch of the object itself. The third sketch shows a smaller view of the horizon and the object's position relative to it.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
