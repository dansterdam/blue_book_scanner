The image appears to contain a photograph or sketch of some unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The image shows small lights of different colors, including red, green, blue, white, and pink, that were observed moving in a particular direction.

The text in the document reads as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? YES It did not fade away or rush away, it appeared to just vanish.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? YES It moved behind such things as trees, and at one time, a telephone post.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? YES Trees, telephone post and wires. Never in front of the moon that we can remember.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - no sound at all
b. Color - dark, brownish, metallic gray 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how many times the object is covered by the length of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
We watched this object for one hour, almost. It was very close to us at one time, and when it was closest to us, many parts of it would have been covered by the match head.

19. Draw a picture of what will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place on arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The sketch shows several small lights of different colors (red, green, blue, white, pink) that were moving in this direction when passing overhead. They were different colors and gave the impression of being hundreds of feet in diameter.
