Dear Sir,
On November 26, 1968 at 10:45, I looked out of my window and saw a strange object slowly crossing the sky, moving from east to west. It was approximately 200 ft in diameter and about 100 ft above the ground. It had a bright dome in the center and portholes around the circumference. I watched it for about 3 minutes until it disappeared over the horizon.
UFO? Looks like balloon or similar object in the sky.
