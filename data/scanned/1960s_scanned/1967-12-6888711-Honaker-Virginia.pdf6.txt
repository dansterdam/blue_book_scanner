Dear
This is in replies to your letter of December 20, 1967. Yes, it is possible to take a picture of a flying saucer as you suggested.
The photo which you submitted is an excellent example of a fake flying saucer. Thank you for your letter and good luck.
Sincerely,
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
