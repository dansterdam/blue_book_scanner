THIS PICTURE is one of several taken last July during a fantastic saucer sighting in South Argentina. The picture was taken by a news photographer in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, named Jose Palma, who was called out at 8:30 p.m. on the night of July 15th to interview a group of people who had just seen a UFO. In the course of a somewhat frantic viewing interview and photography, this photograph was made. Dozens of other saucer reports in July and August came from Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Honduras, Ecuador, Paraguay, Brazil, Venezuela, Chile, and many scattered parts of Argentina.
