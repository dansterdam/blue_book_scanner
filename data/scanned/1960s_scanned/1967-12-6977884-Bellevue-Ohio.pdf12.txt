2. If the object was far enough away to light up the sky in the northwest, it certainly wouldn't be as close as 300 ft. Also, if the car was headed north, the driver should have had excellent visibility toward the northwest from the drivers front window. If the observer did have to roll down his window so as to see the object, the object must have been nearly overhead. What was the source of the light that lit up the sky in the northwest and caused the observer to stop? If the object was bright enough to light up the sky while 300 ft over the observers car, why is it that no one else in the area seems to have seen it at this point? Especially since his friends were only about 1500 ft away ("a quarter-mile away.")

4. "Five in one car driven by _____, we started after yet the observer lists only three witnesses.
