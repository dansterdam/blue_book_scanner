STRANGE SIGHTING NEAR SCOTT HILL GARDENS

TWO BELLINGHAM WOMEN SEE "DANGEROUSLY FLYING SAUCER"

BELLINGHAM - Two Bellingham women, Mrs. Martha Petry and Mrs. Ruth Kuehl, reported seeing a strange object in the sky near Scott Hill Gardens about 10:15 Tuesday night.

Mrs. Petry said they observed the object hovering over the area for about a half hour as they stood in their driveway. It appeared to be a saucer-shaped craft with flashing lights, she said.

"It wasn't anything so big that it would attract a lot of attention, but it was big enough so that we could see it clearly," Mrs. Petry said. "We watched it hovering over the area and then it started moving up and down, back and forth, in a very strange manner."

Mrs. Petry said the object remained in sight for about a half hour before it disappeared from view.

"We didn't know what it was," Mrs. Petry said. "It was nothing like an airplane or a helicopter. It moved in a very strange way."

Mrs. Kuehl agreed with her neighbor's description of the object.

"We couldn't figure out what it was," she said. "We watched it for a long time and it was definitely not an airplane or anything we've seen before. It was very strange."

Mrs. Petry said they telephoned the police, but were told there was nothing the authorities could do about the sighting.

"I guess they didn't believe us," she said. "But we know what we saw and it was definitely something strange and dangerously flying over our neighborhood."
