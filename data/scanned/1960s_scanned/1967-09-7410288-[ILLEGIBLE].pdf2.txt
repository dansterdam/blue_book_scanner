It looked like it might have been searching for something, and then it would stand still a while and then slowly move on to one side or the other. It seemed to stop at the same place a few times, which leads me to think this was what it was looking for. We were facing east. Whatever it was was in the south eastern sky.

As far as I know it moved too fast too be a satellite. 

It seemed as thought when it finally decided to leave just sort of up into the atmosphere. I read a lot of science fiction but I do not think this is my imagination as my sister saw it first and called my attention to it.
