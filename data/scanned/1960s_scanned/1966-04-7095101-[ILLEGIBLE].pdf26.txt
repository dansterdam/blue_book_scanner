There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old Project Blue Book report. The text shown appears to be a portion of a questionnaire or report form, with fields for "Date you completed this questionnaire:", "Month", "Day", "Year", and "Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting". The handwritten text appears to be a response to the last field, though the content is not entirely legible.

AND PROCEEDED ON COURSE. SIGHTED BY OBSERVER AND OTHER PERSONNEL ON DUTY AT THE TIME.
