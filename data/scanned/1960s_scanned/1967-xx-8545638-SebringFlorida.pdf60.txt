17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound none
b. Color and shape lights. Lights reflected. Smooth metal?
We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
The entire object would have been covered by the match head.
18. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
