18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object as much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object's diameter or length would have been covered by the match head?
The angular size was about the same as a match head at arm's length.

The sketch shows an arrow-shaped object moving from right to left at an angle, with the words "Faster than moved back" written next to it.
