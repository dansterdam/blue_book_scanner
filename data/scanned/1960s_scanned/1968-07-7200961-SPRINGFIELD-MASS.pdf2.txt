On this evening a group of people were gathered at a farm house, near Springfield, Massachusetts, when suddenly a bright luminous object was seen in the sky. It seemed to be hovering and moving erratically for some time. It would speed up suddenly, then slow down and hover, repeating this pattern of behavior. The object appeared to be oval or disk-shaped and was emitting a bright pulsating light. Several of the witnesses observed the object through binoculars and felt that it was definitely not an aircraft or any other known object. After a period of about 30 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated and shot straight up, disappearing from view very rapidly.
