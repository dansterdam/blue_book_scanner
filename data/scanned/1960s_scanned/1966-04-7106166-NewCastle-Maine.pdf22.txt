'Like Two Saucers Clamped Together'
"It always happens to other people, doesn't it?" said Curtis Tiedt. "But this time it happened to me."
What happened on Route 27 near the dump near Montauks Home for the Aged, Tiedt says, was this: 
He and his wife saw a strange and rapidly hovering object. The object rose and dived at a great speed before hovering motionless about 150 feet in the air. The object, he said, resembled two saucers clamped together. "That's just what it looked like," Tiedt said.
Some other people apparently saw the same object. Two days later, at 10:15 p.m., Sunday, William Beckman of the East Hampton Highway Patrol office while on routine patrol, saw a bright, steady white light at what he estimated to be an altitude of between 3,000 to 5,000 feet.
"It seemed for a way to Curtis, and screened its area along the horizon. 
We just stared at it for several minutes," Tiedt said, "and it faded away to the air."
The night was clear, and the object appeared to be at least a mile away, Tiedt said.
Russ Light, a retired Air Force officer who now owns an electrical supply firm in Montauk, had gone to Montauk and visited some friends when he saw the "thing." He said, "This is the first time I've seen anything to each other for a minute."
Curtis Tiedt and his wife "clamped together," watching the object.

"That's just what it looked like," Tiedt said.
The object remained for several minutes, Curtis said, and it faded out.
Lance some of the light were there, and Tiedt believes others may have seen the object.
"There were no known aircraft in the sky, and my wife and I just stared at it for several minutes," Tiedt said.
"It seemed to float away to the air, and we never knew what it was."
