SPECIAL REPORT

DATE: 7 June 1960

SUBJECT: UNSATISFACTORY CONDITION OF FILM RECOVERED AT BATTLE CREEK, MICHIGAN ON 7 JUNE 1960

1. On 7 June 1960, this office received a roll of 35mm film from the Command Post, Tactical Air Command, at Battle Creek, Michigan. The film was recovered from the site of an aircraft accident which occurred approximately 20 miles south of Battle Creek, Michigan on the evening of 6 June 1960.

2. Upon receipt, the film was delivered to the OSI Photo Laboratory for processing and evaluation. The following observations were made:

a. The film was found to be in an unsatisfactory condition for purposes of interpretation or further evaluation. Extensive heat damage and physical distortion of the film base and emulsion had occurred, rendering the images completely unidentifiable.

b. No discernible images could be detected on the processed film by visual or photographic means.

3. The damaged film has been retained in the OSI Photo Laboratory for a period of 30 days, pending further instructions. No additional action is contemplated at this time.
