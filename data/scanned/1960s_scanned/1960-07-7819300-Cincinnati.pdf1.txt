PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 29 Jul 63  
2. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2030/3462
3. LOCATION: Cincinnati
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: 0 
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 20 min
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: "Bright object" - a light in the sky. The observer states that he first saw the object as a bright light and that it was stationary at first. The object then accelerated and made a fast run, leaving a sort of wake off to the north of the observer.
11. COMMENTS: This sighting has the shortest duration of any observation in the recent files. The rapidity and course or acceleration were so extreme as to instantly discredit any notion of the object being a known satellite, balloon or other conventional aerial device.
