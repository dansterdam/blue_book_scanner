Dear Sirs:
I read an article in the Medical Tribune which says you are still interested in flying objects in the sky.
I would like to tell you what I saw. About 2 years ago I saw a whole formation of bright starlike objects in the sky. They were about the size of a pin head and they were moving across the sky like a carpet of stars and in the northwest near the horizon I saw what looked like a huge mother ship, it was bigger than any of the stars and were darting in all directions. Watched for about 30 seconds and then they all darted into a formation like this-
They were perfectly spaced in this formation and seemed to be in this position for I should say about 2 minutes and then out of sight at a tremendous speed, they were all out of sight in just a few seconds, I am not at all a religious mystic and I don't care who knows it. All this I saw very plainly, about 9:30 or 10 o'clock at night.
Yours truly,
Box 337
