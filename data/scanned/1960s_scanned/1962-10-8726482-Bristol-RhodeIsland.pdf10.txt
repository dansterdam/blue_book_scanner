The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document describing an observation made by a person named Jacocks. The document appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report, as indicated by the header "CLASSIFICATION WILL BE ASSIGNED AT THE END OF FORM THIS IS CONTINUED MAN'S ATTEMPT TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF THE SKY".

The text in the document is as follows:
