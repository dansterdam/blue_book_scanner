The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch depicts a curved horizon line, with an object shown above the horizon at various angles. There is also a compass or directional indicator in the bottom right corner of the image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the sky show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass to show the direction from which you last saw the object.

28. Make a sketch that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a sketch of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
