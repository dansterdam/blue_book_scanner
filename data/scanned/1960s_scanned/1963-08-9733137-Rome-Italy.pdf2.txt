November 5, 1963

Dear General:

Your 1321-63 letter and Lieutenant Colonel Ashton's request of September 34, 1963, addressed to Colonel Willian J. Lewis and Captain Richard R. Clark of this office has been referred to me for consideration. 

The investigation of this report, while to indicate that weather phenomena may have been responsible, does not conclusively solve the sighting. A copy of this report has been forwarded to Colonel William J. Lewis of ATIC for his information.

A copy of this report has been sent to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, civilian consultant for the Air Force program on unidentified flying objects, for his determination of the possible astronomical or atmospheric phenomena which may have been responsible for the sighting.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
