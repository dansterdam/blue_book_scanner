Dear Mr. 

There have been several sightings similar to yours reported to the Air Force during the past year. In most cases, we have found the cause of these sightings to be an aircraft Cowing a lighted aerial advertising sign.

The Chicago area has a company engaged in this type of advertising. The neon lights on their aircraft, when viewed from a distance, can be difficult to read the message unless the observer is fairly close to the aircraft. These aircraft normally fly at an altitude under 500 feet, and if the craft was a mile from your position, then you would see only the sequentially flashing lights.

Thank you for reporting your observation.

Sincerely,

VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
