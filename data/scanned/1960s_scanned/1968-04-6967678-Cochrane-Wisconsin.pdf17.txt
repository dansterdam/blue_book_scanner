The image contains two hand-drawn illustrations. The larger illustration appears to be a compass rose, providing direction indicators such as N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW. The smaller illustrations depict two sketch-style landscape scenes, showing a person standing in the foreground with a panoramic view in the background.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "P" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" ON THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. APPROXIMATE THE ELEVATION ANGLE OF THE PHENOMENON BY DRAWING A LINE FROM THE "X" POSITION TO THE HORIZON. ESTIMATE THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON BY COMPARISON TO THE PERSON SHOWN AND INDICATE WHETHER IT APPEARS LARGER OR SMALLER THAN THE PERSON. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
