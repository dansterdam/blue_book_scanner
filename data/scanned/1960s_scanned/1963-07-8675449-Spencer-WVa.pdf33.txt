paper's opinion...dead.

It was investigated as suspicious in itself but was found to be probably
the fragments of a Japanese balloon, which was known to be in the area
at the time. Because of the presence of communications, Southern Command
became interested, but the people indicated that this was not a national
security matter and the public indicated the same. To prevent
unwarranted rumors and alleged testimony on the part of those who
saw the object, it was decided not to release details
of the incident to the public. No further
action was taken.

If it is significant that Dr. Clarkwell, Mineralogy Department, University Museum, conducted the investigation and pronounced the object as
being totally explicated, the public would have been extremely confused
and frustrated.

There was a number of less than satisfactory features to the sighting from
a scientific point of view. Editors of technical journals and others who had
seen the films were critical of the lack of data and the poor quality of the
films. They were also doubtful as to the value of further investigation.
