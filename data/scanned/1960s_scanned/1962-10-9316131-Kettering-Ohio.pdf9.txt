While KSU was driving a car at Beal & St. Route 43, when Mr. X's object blinked on the horizon, it went out. He pulled off the road & it was seen again. They were 3 miles N of Streetsboro. They were less than 60-seconds the first time. The object was out in the distance & made no noise. It appeared as one red light revolving. The object looked to be about 2000 feet up. It started to go out - first one side would go out, then the other side would go out. It pulled off the road 3/4 mile N of Kent. The object left the scene without a sound. There was no sound that could be heard from the object. He could now see 5 red lights, separated by about 1/2 mile. The lights were about the size of a dime at arm's length. He watched it for 5 minutes until it finally disappeared in the distance. There were no other observers with him, but he felt the craft might be a balloon or some type of experimental craft. He had no information on what the object was, but it could have been two separate craft, but he felt the craft might be a balloon or some type of experimental craft.
