CANYON FERRY, MONTANA - 12 APRIL 1964

ABSTRACT: On 12 April 1964 at 1230 hours, two airmen were on a routine mission in the vicinity of Canyon Ferry, Montana, when they saw two round, luminous objects hovering over a frozen lake near the shore. The objects were approximately 3-4 feet in diameter and appeared to be approximately 30 feet above the ground. The objects were observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before they shot off rapidly to the northwest, accelerating to a high rate of speed.

The airmen stopped the vehicle and got out to have a better view of the objects. They recorded their observations in a report immediately after the incident. No explanation for the objects was determined.
