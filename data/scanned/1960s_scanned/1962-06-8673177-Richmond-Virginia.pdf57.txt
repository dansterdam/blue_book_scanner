Dear Mrs. ---------

The reports of the sighting of the unidentified flying object over your area has been referred to the Air Force for reply. Inquiry into this observation indicates that no record of the incident has been investigated by this organization. Evaluations of sightings of this type are normally conducted by the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. However, the information as contained in your letter does not constitute conclusive evidence to the real nature of the observation. the characteristics of the phenomenon as you described them do not fit any known pattern of terrestrial or extraterrestrial vehicles under intelligent control.

The findings of our analysis of this case will provide you with additional details of our findings.

Sincerely,
