The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass rose diagram that instructs the observer to place an "X" at the center of the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when first seen, and then place an "A" on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when last seen.

The second sketch depicts two landscapes, labeled A and B, which appear to illustrate the movement or change in the position of the phenomenon between the "A" and "B" points on the compass.

6A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION SEEN WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS.
