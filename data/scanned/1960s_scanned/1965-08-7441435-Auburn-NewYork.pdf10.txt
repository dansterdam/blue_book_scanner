Dear Project,
I don't know if I should report this, but I feel I must. Today I saw the so-called disc, said to be hovering, at about 2:45 p.m. and was quite close. I decided to travel the route again tonight, arriving home at about 3:45 a.m. and still traveling with care for obvious reasons.

I feel that I have already reported such a thing before, but I would like to call your attention to the fact that so many good and reliable townspeople have had good reason to turn in reports on the night of August 23, 1965. I would like to make sure that this night of strange things is not forgotten, and that the significance of an incident is not lost in a mass of reports, since there were many.

Sincerely,
