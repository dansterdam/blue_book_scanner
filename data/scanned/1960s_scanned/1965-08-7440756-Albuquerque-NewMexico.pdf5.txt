This image does not contain any photographs, only illustrations and text. The first illustration appears to be a sketch showing the position and movement of a UFO object. The second illustration is a compass-like diagram. The text below the illustrations provides instructions and questions related to the illustrations.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where the object was when you last saw it.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and an "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
