The image contains a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, a historic UFO investigation program. There does not appear to be any photograph present in this particular page. I will now transcribe the text from the document:

For the Record:
11 Jan 67

Contact was made with Major Hyla (ex-3115) in regards to the sighting reported on 7 Jan 67. He said that he had gone out to the scene of the sighting and had picked up copies of the original pictures. He said that the family was very cooperative and had given them the pictures. 

Major Hyla said that the pictures showed "a metallic bright object" which was 50 to 75 yards from the point where the picture was taken. The pipe and tree branches that were in one of the pictures were only about four feet from the camera. These two things were in fairly sharp focus. The camera would have been about 10 to 15 feet from the object.

There was ice on the lake which ruled out the possibility of the object being a boat but did not see any. The family back yard looked like a "junk yard" where Major Hyla looked around the yard for a similar object but could not find anything.

Major Hyla was asked to go back to the scene and take a picture which would come up by overnight US AFB courier to 6-33 aircraft at approximately 1900 hours. He said that he thought the photos could have been faked by changing something from the original picture. He would try to obtain the original pictures for our use.

22 Jan 67

Major Hyla called to say that he would try to obtain the original pictures. He was puzzled by the fact that the boys said that they saw all the pictures before the helicopter was low but according to the last picture, the object was "gone before the helicopter". Major Hyla also said that he had noticed a corrugated texture on the helicopter picture. The helicopter was surprise to be closer and higher than the alleged object.
