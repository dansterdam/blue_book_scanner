Dear Dr. Hynek:

I am sorry I could not answer your letter sooner, but have been hospitalized and am just now getting after correspondence. 

In answer to your query, I remember remarking that there were only three noticeable stars in the sky, and they were directly above us. The moon was not visible at any time during the interval.

To correct an answer I gave you on the phone, I believe I told you I thought it was a "blinking" light rather than a "twinkling" one. After consulting my husband we decided it was more like a "twinkling star".

I am enclosing a summary written by my husband which may clear up any information left hazy by my original explanation.

Sincerely yours,
