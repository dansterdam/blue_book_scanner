REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
EAGLE RIVER, WISCONSIN
UFO SIGHTING
APRIL 18, 1961

At about 11:00 a.m. on April 18, [redacted] was having a late breakfast in his home. (See picture) When he heard a noise which he described as a car going around a curve in a great hurry, a screeching like that of some-thing like a jet. [redacted] (also later) who stated that he had told him that it had sounded like a screeching motor car. The consensus seems to be the sound it made while coming down was in a whirling like a jet. Apparently he told [redacted] that on its way down it sounded like "knobby tires on a wet pavement." He looked out the window and saw descending a bright, chrominumcolored, disk-shaped object which he described as two soup bowls, one over-turned on the other. [redacted] stated he was not frightened by the apparition, but went out immediately because of his curiosity. When he got there, the hatch, or hatchway, was already opened. [redacted] stated that the hatchway operated something like a trunk of a car that is hinged from the top and the lower lip would coincide with the equator of the ship. He stated that when closed it was completely imperceptible, and that he would have sworn there was no possible opening there. The space ship as drawn by him is enclosed. When he came out, an occupant of said vehicle was leaning out, which and making motions with his hands suggesting that he needed water or some other liquid. That is, he made drinking motions. [redacted] was handed down a "thermos jug-like bottle" (see drawing) which he says was quite unlike any jug he has ever seen here. "A beautiful thing", he said.
