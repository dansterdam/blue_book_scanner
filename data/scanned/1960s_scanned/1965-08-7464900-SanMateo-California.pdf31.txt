Text extracted from the document:

POLICE IN both Springdale and Fayetteville, Arkansas reported receiving calls of flying objects around 9:00 p.m. Tuesday, August 4, 1965. The Springdale Police reported seeing lights that hovered over the area for sometime and then 'took off at a terrific rate of speed.'

Mrs. Charles Edward Craig, who lives near the area, reported seeing a reddish white light over the Springdale area. She said it hovered and 'acted like it was beating its wings.' Another resident, Mr. H.B. James, said he saw the flying object and it was 'larger than a star and smaller than a planet.'

Police in both cities said they did not have any explanation for the reported sightings. This is the third time in the past several months that flying objects have been reported in the area.
