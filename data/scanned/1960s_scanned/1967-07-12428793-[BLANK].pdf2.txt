The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, discussing the history of the UFO phenomena and the public relations aspect of it.

The text on the image is as follows:

for use in determining long range requirements should be determined.
If results should indicate that public concern has been over-
estimated, then consideration should be given to dropping all
official (government) interest in UFOs.
The history of Project Blue Book alone has shown that the
UFO phenomena is mainly that of a public relations problem. The
fringe of believers in extraterrestrial visitation continues
to grow. UFO hobby clubs are a constant critic of Air Force
policies -- the majority of these clubs profess to be studying
the phenomena scientifically.
However, it should be recognized that the public could be
expected to accuse the Air Force of withholding information on
UFOs since their investigation has been assigned to Air Force
Technical Intelligence.
