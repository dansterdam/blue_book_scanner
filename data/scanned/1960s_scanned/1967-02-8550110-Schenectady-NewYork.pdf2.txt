Project Blue Book Information Office
Schenectady, D.C.
February 8, 1967

Dear Project Blue Book:
I received your reply for information on Unidentified Flying Objects. Don't get me wrong, I got the information but enclosed in one of your booklets there was a letter from one of your investigators stating that they had a lot of good pictures and information on the subject, but I realized no more to the investigation seems to be there is much more to this subject. Is that really so? You say there isn't, but I know there must have been some sort of window film or something in the photos that showed there was some connection to my sighting. I wanted to photograph it but I was no allowed (as I was told, they never seen any such thing), so I decided to send you a copy and you decided that there was not a serious condition, yet I'm absolutely sure that it was not true. The other chap who reported this too, some weeks ago, got the same reply, and pulsating lights. I wasn't even sure it existed but now I'm told it doesn't. The other fellow saw something, and I saw something, we couldn't make it out, seemed like something, couldn't even see clear but say something. this went much too fast, this was the third time I have seen such a thing and I think I've got to get organized and get out there more and follow up on this. Would you please send me more information. At least the world would end, so can you give me more information on what to focus it on when I see something. I would appreciate it and I'm sure others would too. Send me more information.

Sincerely Yours,
