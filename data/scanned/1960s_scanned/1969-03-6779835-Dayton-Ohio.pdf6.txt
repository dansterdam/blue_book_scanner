There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book report, with a text field for handwritten notes.

As an OCR system, I can produce the following text from the document:

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

Please wr very familar with the case . The known what file iten are not present normally.
