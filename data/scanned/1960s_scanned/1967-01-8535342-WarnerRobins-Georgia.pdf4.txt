Radiant. Moving Objects Sighted
"I Know I Saw It--I'm Not Crazy"
By ALBERT E. DIX
On a farm about 12 miles east of Savannah, Ga., on the evening of Sunday, January 15, began strange thoughts crossing my mind.
"I didn't give it much thought at the time, thinking perhaps it was a cloud being reflected by the sun."
At 6:30 a.m. it was still dark. The start of daylight in a blueish-gray, cloudless sky.
Suddenly, there was, somewhat unexplainably, a stirring of something unusual coming from this direction. Could it be a group of ducks or geese, I thought. As I looked I could see, almost directly overhead, a strange, radiant-like objects.
"It was moving rapidly, erratic in its motion, and was blinking off and on," he said.
One was sighted at about 8:45 p.m. Wednesday, 80 miles southwest of Warner Robbins.
The object, he said, was moving toward the southwest at a high rate of speed, blinking off and on. He stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape, silver in color, and that it gave off a reddish glow. 
It didn't make any noise that could be heard, and there were no visible means of propulsion.
The witness stated that he observed the object for about 3-4 minutes before it disappeared from view in the distance.
