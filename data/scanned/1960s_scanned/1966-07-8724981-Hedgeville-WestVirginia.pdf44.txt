The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. However, there is no photograph or image visible in this particular page. 

Here is the text from the document:

4:15 Time and (object was stationary)
(red) in the west

Before 8:10, the 3 small objects 
moved area, blue up like balloons - appears transparent
may, one at this time, = 3?-4?

8:25 a.m. Black spot opened and shut very
quickly. Resembled an old man's
mouth to me. It takes as many 
forms of action (see) in a white object we call D.

Oh, this is my personal idea - but I believe
(1) has had influences from the back or
he shaking a center out of collection
of many descriptions. -> The No. 112 in the
black sheet, could have stuck each other

So interesting
