1. The Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson AFB has evaluated a report, of an unidentified flying object which was observed on 25 May 1965 from the US Advisory Group in Thailand. The object, which "fell" from the Royal Thai Air Force, appears to be part of the igniting mechanism of a US Rocket.

2. We would appreciate your assistance in identifying the object in order that an adequate reply may be made to the US Advisory Group.
