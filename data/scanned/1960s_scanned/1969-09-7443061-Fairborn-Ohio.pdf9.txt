THE PHENOMENON: AS I WAS DRIVING ALONG ROUTE 444 IN DAYLIGHT, I NOTICED A SMALL CRAFT HOVERING ABOUT 500 FT. ABOVE THE TREESPS. THIS CRAFT WAS A LEMON SHAPE LARGER THAN ONE CHROMATIC METEOR. IT WAS MAKING A WHINING NOISE AND AS I WATCHED IT, IT SHOT STRAIGHT UP AND DISAPPEARED. THIS HAPPENED IN THE VICINITY OF FAIRBORN, OHIO.
