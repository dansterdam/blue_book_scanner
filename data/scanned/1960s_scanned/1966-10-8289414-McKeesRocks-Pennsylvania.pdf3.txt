This object about 21-22 inches long, was at a height of about 400 yards from the observer. It seemed to be brightly lit and I could see the object very clearly. It was oval shaped, and I would say about 3 15 x 4 11 inches in size. The object seemed to be hovering and may have been slightly rotating. I never saw any signs of wings or propulsion and I heard no sound at all. It disappeared in a horizontal direction, and was gone from sight in about 2 to 3 seconds.
