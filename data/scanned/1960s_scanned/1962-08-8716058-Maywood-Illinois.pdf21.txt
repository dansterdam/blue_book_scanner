The image provided does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page of a text document related to a Project Blue Book UFO report.

200 ft. per second and they passed them about 3-4 times a night, sometimes remaining in the air for as long as 15 minutes.

The bottom of the object was dark or lead-colored. One boy observed it had a portholelike device which emitted a bright light, which formed a beam of light directed toward the ground.

When Mr Herman, an officer at Quality Controls of Orville, Ohio, contacted the Dayton Controla Agency to report the same sighting, he was told his report had previously been picked up when he saw the picture of the UFO in the Orville (crviGle) newspaper. This was done at the request of Commander POIC, who had been notified.

We accepted his offer to show us the photograph which he had taken some days later at which time he had tracked down the negatives and produced the photograph showing the object. (Since ground by POIC is not further identified, assume it refers to the Air Force Project Blue Book unit.)

When he later tried to show us the photograph, he stated that it had been stolen from him and that he had no other copies. He then related the circumstances under which the photograph had been taken.

The information contained in this text indicates that there was a Project Blue Book UFO report filed regarding a sighting in Maywood, Illinois in 1962. The document describes the sighting details, including the appearance and motion of the UFO object, as well as the attempt by the witness to provide a photograph of the object. However, the photograph was ultimately not available for review.
