UFO SIGHTING, BICES AFB, 25 MARCH 1960

1. On 26 March 1960, three airmen on guard duty at Biggs AFB, Texas, spotted an object which was described as bright light approximately the size of a half-dollar coin held at arm's length. The object was approximately one thousand yards from their position and at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately four seconds.

2. Analysis of all available information indicates that the sighting was probably a lenticular or partially obscured celestial body which was observed in the initial stages of becoming visible as a result of illumination from the rising sun. Witnesses to the incident stated that the object did not appear to leave a trail or exhibit any other extraordinary characteristics.

3. The following personnel assigned to the 25th Combat Defense Squadron witnessed the sighting:

Stout, John G., s/Sgt
Chase, Claude A./Sgt
Picken, Kenneth L., a/2c

4. For your information this sighting was classified confidentially. This is one of a number of sightings reported from this area recently which have been scrutinized. None of the reported details are considered classic or alarming, indicating only the normal problems associated with the identification of the many natural objects observed.
