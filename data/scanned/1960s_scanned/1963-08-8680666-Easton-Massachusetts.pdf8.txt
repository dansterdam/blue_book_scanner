There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old report document containing handwritten text.

The following is the text found in the document:

The following is a statement of my belief, which in some manner may be entirely subjective - - - If you please, it is as follows:

My sighting - Date, Mrs. B's (?) 5:30 p.m. - certainly notated.

Rev. Anthony Assam - if known, what I would have said.

"Unidentified" - It's feeling to me that that term designate this particular vehicle as perhaps needing more study, or in conclusion, possibly what our investigative service or authority may have already done. Is it definitely unknown? 

I had another view (to the?) 5 sighting, more clearly. Yet, I may state, for any one interested in the vehicle, the light appeared again in that relative direction, brightly white in light.
