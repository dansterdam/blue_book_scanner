Text transcribed from the image:

"I was in my backyard at Houston, Texas at approximately 7:30 pm CDT and I was watching a regular type of Houston streetlight about 1/2 mile away when I noticed a bright light in the sky moving in a northwest direction at a very high rate of speed. 
The light appeared to be a large disc or saucer shaped craft which was highly illuminated and was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. The craft had a definite outer ring which appeared to be rotating or spinning. The inner portion of the craft remained stationary. The outer ring was brighter than the center portion and was giving off a bluish-white light. The whole craft appeared to be about the size of a large weather balloon.
The craft traveled in a level flight path and disappeared from sight in approximately 15 seconds. This sighting lasted for a period of approximately 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.
I noted the time as approximately 7:30 pm CDT and I watched the craft travel in a northwesterly direction until it passed out of sight."
