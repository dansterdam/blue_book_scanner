The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten letter or document from the Project Blue Book UFO investigation. The text in the document is as follows:

Dear Sir:
It can be easily the letter of a U.F.O. or a sight of this material light which started to move and seemed to stop at 6:30 P.M. on January 11, 1962. Dayton, Ohio. The number of witnesses were 5 who resided in the vicinity of Beavercreek, Ohio and noticed something unusual in the sky. It looked round. Colors there were many that kept changing. I went outside and heard the humming sound which was running, coming at a good rate. The object was silently, slowly moving. It was a clear night. If you wish to identify me and need more details contact me at the address below.
