The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document. The document appears to be part of a report from Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The document text reads:

"Intelligence Division Officer, KESSLER AFB. (Comments?)
This object could have been a WHISPER JET FLYING HOWEVER REPORT FILED DUE TO OTHER REPORTED SIGHTINGS IN OTHER AREAS.
