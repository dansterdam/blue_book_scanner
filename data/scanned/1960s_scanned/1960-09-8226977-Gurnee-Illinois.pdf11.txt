Approximately two months ago I became interested in watching the object reported in the newspapers for some time near Gurnee, Illinois. This object was described as a disc shaped object and was moving very slowly.
The object could be seen almost every evening at approximately 9:00 P.M. and remained in view for about 30 to 45 minutes. The object appears to be at an altitude of 3000 to 5000 feet above the horizon.
On a clear night it will appear to be a star, what by "Northern Star" and it is about 30 to 35 degrees above the horizon. 
As the object travels from North to South it appears to vibrate or oscillate from side to side as it passes across the sky. As it gets nearer to the horizon the colors start to change from a white to a very deep orange or red.
Could you offer any information on this.

Sincerely yours,
