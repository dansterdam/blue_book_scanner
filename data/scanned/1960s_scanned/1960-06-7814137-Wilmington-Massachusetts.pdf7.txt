REPLY TO
ATTN OF: (CWOE/Capt Mariconda/2648)	11 July 1960

SUBJECT: U. F. O.

1. In compliance with par 15 AFR 200-2, the following information is submitted with reference to the siting of a U. F. O. by Mr. at 1828, 29 June 1960.

Description of the Object:
1. Object was egg shaped. Mr. stated that the object appeared to be fuzzy or choppy on the outside which caused it to be egg shaped. For a lack of ability to describe it properly over the telephone he described it as round to Col Hunt in his original report.
2. Size appeared to be the size of a match head held at arms length.
3. Color: Upon first noticing the object Mr. said it was white in color then appeared metallic as it turned.
4. Only one object was seen.
5. No formation.
6. Object appeared to be above 50,000 feet but larger than a bomber would appear at that altitude. This conclusion was reached when I informed Mr. that our aircraft are generally above 30,000 feet when they make vapor trails. He stated he had seen many times and related how it was almost impossible to see the aircraft making them and felt that 50,000 feet was a reasonable estimate of the object's altitude.
7. No tail, trail or exhaust was seen.
8. No sound or noise was heard.
9. Speed was unusual, fast as compared to the relatively slow speed bombers appear to be moving when high enough to make vapor trails as observed by Mr. Estimated speed to be 1000 mph or better.
