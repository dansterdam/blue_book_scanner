The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with a graph or diagram showing the labels "APPEAR" and "DISAPPEAR" along with some handwritten notes at the bottom of the image.

WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL, AS WE SEE IT, WAS A POINT OF LIGHT. THAT PORTION IS AS SHOWN IN THE GRAPH. THE SHAPE THEN APPEARED TO GROW IN SIZE AND BECOME SOMEWHAT RECTANGULAR IN SHAPE. IT THEN GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF SEEMING TO TIP UP OR ELEVATE SLIGHTLY AND THEN DISAPPEAR FROM VIEW.
