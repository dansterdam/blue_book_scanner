OPENING VISUAL APPEARANCE
     Large irregular shaped object about 50' in
     diameter hovering approximately 300 feet above 
     a field.
DESCRIPTION
     A large round object, approximate diameter 50 feet,
     was observed hovering at an altitude of about 300
     feet above a field by the observer, who was seated
     in his car at the side of a rural road near Covington,
     Indiana. The object was first spotted about 8:15
     P.M. on November 6, 1967, while the observer was
     driving along the road. The object was visible for
     about 10 minutes before it moved slowly northward
     and disappeared from view. The sky was clear at the
     time and no sounds were heard from the object.
CONCLUSION
     Despite the clear visual sighting, no physical evidence
     was obtained. The report is therefore classified as
     UNIDENTIFIED.
