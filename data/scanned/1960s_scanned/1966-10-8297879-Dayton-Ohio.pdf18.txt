34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 27 Day March Month 1967 Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

During the more than 20 years I spent in various aeronautical qualifications I have never observed anything of the nature. I have seen more of this type of phenomena in association with my professional duties (flying the Atlantic, etc.). I've seen many windshield reflections. I've also received radio/television interference.

But this, particularly considering my wifes qualifications and conformations, in our minds this must be an actual sighting.

In conclusion let me say that I must apologize for not having replied to your request for additional information sooner.

Major Quintanilla I must add that I do believe in UFOs - or some logical explanation of the phenomena I cannot then accept as being "space ships". This is my firm conviction and I would hasten to assure you that, whatever I may personally think, have not been influenced by what I've been through enough to-decide not to try, or went, to "snow" anyone.
