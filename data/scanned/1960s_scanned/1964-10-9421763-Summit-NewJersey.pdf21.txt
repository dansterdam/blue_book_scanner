Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your statement that the Air Force UFO investigative unit is a cover-up is quite true. The incidents you mention about the UFO sightings near New York are interesting. The Air Force investigator apparently was not able to find a natural explanation for the sightings. A pattern or the sightings is as follows: Lights were observed to the north with rapid movements northeast to southwest. Some of the sightings were from northeast to southwest. Some sightings were from northwest to southeast. Another witness to the north saw a meteor-like object pass overhead from north to south. These sightings occurred on 17 September. I would then suggest that you contact Major Jack Vacca, USAF, Chief, Data Retrieval Office of information, Clearwater, Florida.

Sincerely,

MAJOR W. JACOBS
