MAN TELLS OF ENCOUNTER WITH A 'FLYING SAUCER'
HARRISONBURG. - Horace Burns told a crowd of townsmen here that he encountered what he believes was a 'flying saucer' on Dec. 12 between Staunton and Waynesboro. Burns said the object was about 30 feet in diameter and hovered about 10 feet off the ground. He said it was shaped like a saucer and had a red glow, though there was no apparent source of light. Burns also reported that the object left a radioactive residue on the ground.
LEHMAN MADE A SKETCH
Lehman said he has received a letter from a USAF officer who said the incident "appears to be authentic." He also quoted a passage from the New Testament, saying the appearance of the object coincides with Old Testament references to "chariots of fire."
Lehman said a man named Gehman made a sketch of the object, which he said showed it to be about 30 feet in diameter and shaped like a saucer. Gehman said the object had a red glow and was witnessed by several people. Lehman said the object was seen for about 10 minutes and then took off and disappeared.
