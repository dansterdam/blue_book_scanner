Dear Sir:
A short time ago sitting in my yard I saw two blue-white pulsating lights passing across the sky from east to west. These were at about 10 degrees of the horizon and traveled from south to north.
They seemed to shift in intensity, going from a bright glow to a dimmer light, and then made another sharp 90 degree turn and headed north still glowing brightly.
It then made another sharp turn of about 45 degrees turn and seemed to increase in speed until it dwindled away to a silver star.
This is as I have described an independent witness who saw this, too. As seen instead of the red glow.
I am writing this letter in accordance with the Air Technical Intelligence Center's policies for reporting of such matters.
Thank you.
Palatka Fla.
