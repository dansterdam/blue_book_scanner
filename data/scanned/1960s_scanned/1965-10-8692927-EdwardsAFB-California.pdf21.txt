THIS OTHER PORTION OF THE TAPED CONVERSATION THAT MERITS FURTHER CONSIDERATION DEALS MAINLY WITH THE APPEARANCE OF SOME OBJECT OR LIGHT IN THE SKY WHICH A TELEPHONE COMPANY EMPLOYEE WAS ALLEGED TO HAVE SEEN. ACCORDING TO THE CONVERSATION, SOME EMPLOYEE OF THE TELEPHONE COMPANY CALLED IN A REPORT AT 8:00 P.M. ON SEPTEMBER 19, 1965 THAT HE HAD SEEN AN OBJECT IN THE SKY. HE ALLEGEDLY TOLD THE SUPERVISOR THAT HE HAD BEEN CALLED BY AN EMPLOYEE OF THE TELEPHONE COMPANY WHO APPARENTLY HAD SEEN SOMETHING IN THE SKY AND WANTED TO REPORT IT.

THE SUPERVISOR APPARENTLY COMMUNICATED THIS INFORMATION TO OTHERS AND ONE OF THEM IS REPORTED TO HAVE ALLEGED THAT THE SUPERVISOR HAD SEEN THE OBJECT, BUT THE SUPERVISOR DENIED THIS. THE OBJECT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE MOVED RAPIDLY AND THEN APPEARED TO REMAIN STATIONARY FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE MOVING OFF AND DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW.

THE REPORT MENTIONS A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN WHO WAS INTERVIEWED LATER AND WHO IS SAID TO HAVE CONFIRMED THAT HIS CAR RADIO HAD INTERFERED WITH THE RECEPTION JUST ABOUT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.

I AM VERY IMPRESSED BY THIS PORTION OF THE INCIDENT. PEOPLE AT THE TELEPHONE COMPANY APPARENTLY KNOW THAT SOME EMPLOYEES SAW SOMETHING IN THE SKY THAT EVENING THAT THEY FEEL WARRANTS FURTHER INQUIRY. IT SEEMS TO BE MORE THAN THE USUAL UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT REPORT AND THERE IS AN IMPLICATION THAT SOMETHING QUITE UNUSUAL AND OUT OF THE ORDINARY OCCURRED. THERE WAS APPARENTLY SOME RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF SOME TO PROVIDE FULL INFORMATION, ORIGINALLY QUERIED BY THE REPORT'S WRITER, UNTIL THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN ASSURANCES THAT THE INFORMATION WOULD BE TREATED IN CONFIDENCE.

AS IT HAPPENED, THE OBSERVERS WERE ALL FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS (THAT IS, OTHER THAN THE DEPARTMENT THAT SUBMITTED THE REPORT) WHO HAD BEEN CALLED IN TO ASSIST TEMPORARILY AND DID NOT NORMALLY WORK IN THE BUILDING. THIS, IN ITSELF, MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A RELUCTANCE TO PROVIDE FULL DETAILS SINCE THESE EMPLOYEES PERHAPS DID NOT FEEL FULLY AUTHORIZED OR EXPECTED TO REPORT ON SUCH MATTERS.

IN SUMMARY, DO YOU IN THE AIR DEFENSE COMMAND COULD PROVIDE A KNOWLEDGEABLE ANALYSIS AND PERHAPS DETERMINE IF THERE IS INDEED SUBSTANCE TO THE INCIDENT SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATION.
