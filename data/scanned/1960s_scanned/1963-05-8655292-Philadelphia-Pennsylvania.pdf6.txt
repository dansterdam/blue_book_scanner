19 June 1963

Dear Mr. ---

Your sighting of 23 May is similar to many reported observations of aircraft contrails with the sun reflecting on them as dusk.

Statistics for years 1957-1962 are included:
The fact that any aircraft disappears from radar is no proof it is an unidentified aerial vehicle.
Photographs or sightings are not available.
The movie "UFO" was a Green-Rouse production and had no connection with its production or release.
