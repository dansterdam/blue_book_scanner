The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The image shows a grid pattern and what looks like handwritten or typewritten text.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

CASE HISTORY
Date: 4 January 1961
Location: Akron, Ohio
NARRATIVE:
On 4 January 1961, at approximately 1845 hours, a caller phoned the Akron Police Department and reported sighting a strange, lighted object in the sky near the city. The object was described as being about the size of a small airplane and having a bluish-white light that was pulsating. Further, the caller stated the object was moving quite rapidly and making sharp, erratic maneuvers.
Police officers were dispatched to investigate the reported sighting, and they verified that an unusual object was indeed present in the sky. The officers stated the object appeared to be reflecting sunlight and was moving at a high rate of speed, altering its course sharply and suddenly.
The sighting was also reported by several other citizens in the Akron area. The object was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes before it disappeared from view.
An investigation was conducted, but no conclusive explanation for the sighting could be determined. The case was subsequently forwarded to Project Blue Book for further analysis.
