UFO form continued
Sighted at approximately 7:55 pm November 8, 1966, San Pedro, California. Object was very large, circular in shape, with lights around the periphery. The object hovered over the area for approximately 1-2 minutes, then accelerated and climbed straight up until it was out of sight. It made no sound, did not have any type wings, and gave the impression that it was under intelligent control. The object seemed to be approximately 500 meters across. I watched this object with 4 other witnesses and we were all very puzzled as to what it could be. I've never seen anything like it in the sky before.
