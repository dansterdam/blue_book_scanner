There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old document containing text describing an analysis of a claimed photograph of the moon. The text states that the image was determined to be a "trailed image of the moon" that was taken on Friday, October 28th, between 11:00 and 12:00 PM EDT, rather than on Sunday, October 30th as claimed.

Eleven minutes of arc on the print is 0.046 inches on the print.
We take as proven the hypothesis that the picture is a trailed image of the moon, and that it was not taken on Sunday, October 30th, as claimed by Mr. ***, but on Friday evening, October 28th, between the hours of 11:00 and 12:00 PM, EDST. The picture is therefore a fraud.
