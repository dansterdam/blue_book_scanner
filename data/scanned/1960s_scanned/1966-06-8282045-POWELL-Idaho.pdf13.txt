A night watchman of Powell, Idaho called me on the night of June 8, 1966 to report a strange object in the sky. The object was first seen at about 10:25 PM and continued to be observed until about 11:15 PM. It was described as a very bright light, larger than a star, and seemed to be hovering or moving slowly across the sky. It did not appear to have any definite shape or outline, but was simply a very bright light. There were no sounds associated with the object. At times it seemed to get dimmer and then brighter again. It was seen by the witness and two other people who were with him at the time. The object appeared to be at a high altitude and was visible in the western part of the sky. The witness estimated it was at least 10 miles away. He said the object did not appear to be an aircraft, helicopter, or any known type of vehicle. He is a reliable witness who has seen many airplanes and other objects in the sky, and was certain this was not any normal aerial vehicle. The object was observed for nearly an hour before it finally disappeared from view. No photographs were taken.
