Reference your letter of 13 Jan 1969. The negatives for the 19 Nov 68, Acton, Texas photo have been submitted to the FTD photo analysis lab. Because the completed UFO photographs are not completed yet, if the observer wants his negatives back immediately, we can return them before the analysis is completed; however, due to higher priority work, the analysis of the negative may take several months yet. Request you notify us of the decision of the observer or have the observer notify us of his decision.
