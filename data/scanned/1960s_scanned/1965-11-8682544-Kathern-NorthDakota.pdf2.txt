The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from the Project Blue Book UFO report. 

The text in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 8 Apr 1965
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

My wife was in the car with me and also saw it. We immediately wrote down the information about it and called this information in to the Air Base at Miles, N.D. the next day. They acted like we had been seeing things so when the questionnaire came from you we just put it aside. While cleaning out my desk today I came across it and decided to fill it out anyway.

We questioned what it was, mainly because it went back up. It was continuous for the time we saw it. If you have an explanation we would be interested in hearing about it.

Sincerely,
