(1) FIRST UFO MOVED, AS INDICATED, IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION FOR APPROX. 30 SECONDS TO 1 MINUTE, THEN STOPPED (FOR APPROX 1 MIN.). THEN SECOND UFO (BRIGHTER OF THE TWO - WHICH I NORMALLY THOUGHT WAS A STAR AND USED AS A POINT OF REFERENCE TO SHOW MY FRIEND THE 1ST UFO BECAUSE THE 1ST UFO WAS VERY NEAR TO IT) STARTED TO MOVE - FIRST SE, THEN SW, THEN WEST, THEN IT ALSO STOPPED MOVING. THE WHOLE MOVEMENT OF THE 2ND UFO LASTED APPROX. 1 MIN. A FEW SECONDS LATER THE 1ST UFO MOVED AGAIN, THIS TIME NORTH. THIS LAST MOVEMENT LASTED APPROX. 30 SECONDS AND THEN IT STOPPED AND BOTH UFO'S REMAINED STATIONARY FOR ANOTHER FEW MINUTES, THEN WENT INDOORS TO CALL NORTON. (WHICH TIME NEITHER MOVED ANYMORE)
