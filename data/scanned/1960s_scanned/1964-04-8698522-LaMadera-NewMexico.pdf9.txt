There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing only text.

Here is the text output from the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the document:

made of a shiny metallic substance, had no windows, and was as long as a telephone pole and about 14 feet in circumference. It was egg-shaped and resembled a large butane tank.

The next morning, feeling braver in the daylight, the family went out to take a look. The UFO was gone, though the ground was still smoldering! Local police were notified, and found a large charred area, strange marks in the ground resembling tiny prints, and depressions similar to those found at Jocorro. As a matter of fact, it is reliably reported that the ground was still smoldering twenty hours after the sighting! The charred area, seen by police, Air Force officials, and many other people, was about 20 feet in diameter. Large rocks within the area showed evidence of extreme heat, while others a few feet away were not damaged at all. Even pieces of glass and metal were found melted and fused. A police officer ventured the opinion that no fuel presently known to mankind would leave the sort of traces found at La Madera. He also felt that the evidence indicated an extreme heat of short duration. We do not yet know what conclusions, if any, were formulated by the Air Force.
