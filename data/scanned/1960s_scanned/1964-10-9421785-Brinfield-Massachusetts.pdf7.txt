Flashing UFO Seen Three Hours
Mrs. Irene Page of Brinfield, Mass. reported to State Police that from about 8:30 P.M. until about 11:45 P.M. on October 9, 1964, she had observed a sparkling ball of light which intermittently appeared and disappeared over the north country. State Police confirm her report in that area that night.
Mrs. Page said the object she saw was flashing on and off when first observed, and that when light streamed through a window, she turned off the lights and watched the object move slowly over the yard and light up the entire property. She said that during the three hours the object was visible she was unable to estimate its size and shape, but that its light at times appeared to blaze and then recede. The light would turn periodically but finally disappeared from view in the distant sky about 11:45 P.M.
Mrs. Page further stated that she was alone in the house with her four children and the nearest neighbor was some distance away. She was unable to contact police during the time the object was there because she had no phone. Mrs. Page further stated that she saw the light come and that the "TV feed" and returned was the same as many neighbors. Mrs. Helen Chevalier, said later the "TV feed" did fluctuate and that she and her neighbors witnessed the same phenomenon.
