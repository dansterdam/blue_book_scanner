Dear Mr. Stetka:
Thanks again for sending the file on the latest UFO sighting. I will get through to it shortly, and I appreciate your sending it along.
As I mentioned, I am interested in sighting data both old and new, and anything further you can provide will be most helpful. My ultimate goal, of course, is to increase the general public's awareness and knowledge of this subject, and the more material I have to work with the better.
The recent cases have been quite interesting, particularly the one where a "close encounter" allegedly took place. I would be most interested in any additional details you might be able to furnish regarding this incident.
Please send me a copy of the entire file, including any photographs, diagrams, or reports that may be associated with it.
I remain,
Sincerely yours,
Frank McKelvie
