The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

The text on the document is as follows:

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 21 MAR 64 - 20/0100Z
2. LOCATION: Roswell, New Mexico
3. SOURCE: civilian 
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: ground visual
7. COURSE: north
8. PHOTOS: Yes
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
Photo analysis indicated that the object reported was not the image on the photo. The image on the photo was probably caused by a chemical drop on the film at some time during its processing. Since the photo did not show an image to compare with the observers' description of the sighting case regarded as insufficient.
