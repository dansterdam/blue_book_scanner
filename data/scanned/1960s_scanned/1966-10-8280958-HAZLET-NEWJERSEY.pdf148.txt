GEORGE ZICKLER JR
Person reporting sighting: Clerk, 502 1/2 N. Faulkine, Hazlet, N.J. Age 32, Postal Clerk
Time of sighting: 12 pm
Duration of sighting: The site was approx. 400 yds to the east.
Description of sighting: The site was on a country road near the intersection of rt 35 and rt 36, Hazlet N.J. Total time seen as approx. 15 minutes.
Narrative: Police Capt. Van Wicke came in from the area north of the city, watching the strange objects in the sky. He told me to go out there and take a look. I rushed out but it was gone. There was a full moon and the other two were smaller, with one being only a third as bright as the other. He turned and told us that's what he saw. (exact copies of what we saw? except as to size, color, etc.)
They were bright and luminously bright. The largest seemed to be 75 to 100 feet in diameter and at the tail end of the largest there seemed to be some "gyrating" and it seemed to be leaving behind a bright trail of light. This turned into a curve tail. During the sighting the tail always remained in the same position relative to the object. The tail was approx. 1/10 the diameter of the object. The objects made no sound. The sighting lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
Investigator Clark said "I don't know what they were, but I am sure the police officers were not afraid of the objects as public as they seem to be."
