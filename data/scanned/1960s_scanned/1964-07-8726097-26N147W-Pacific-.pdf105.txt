Dear Mr.
I am writing to you concerning an object that I observed in the sky while flying over the Pacific Ocean on July 8, 1964. The object was first sighted at approximately 26°N 147°W and was visible for several minutes. It appeared to be dark in color and oblong in shape, with no visible wings or tail. The object seemed to be moving at a high rate of speed and was observed by several crew members on the aircraft. I would be happy to provide any additional details about this sighting if you are interested. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
