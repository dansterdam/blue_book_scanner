Dear Major Quintanilla:

This is a request to have the member of witnesses reinterviewed to get more details on any unexplained phenomena, their explanations and personal opinions of the incident. Apparently this incident was not taken seriously enough by others.

Let me reiterate that this case from September 1966 is still being investigated. Considering the surface details, including testimony suggesting the object did not conform with any known aircraft or meteor, and that the witnesses could establish its relative size and other details, we feel it is necessary to pursue this lead and elicit more data concerning the event.

I would request that you assist in this, as I feel it warrants more thorough documentation and review. Please advise if you can proceed with this additional investigation, as I believe it will shed more light on this potentially significant case.

Thank you for your consideration.
