THE COMPASS AS SHOWN IN THIS PICTURE IS USED BY THE OBSERVERS TO DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT WHEN LAST SEEN, AND AS A CHECK TO SEE IF THE OBJECT HAS MOVED OR IF THE OBSERVATION POSITION HAS CHANGED. WHEN LAST SEEN, THE OBJECT WAS IN THE ESE DIRECTION. THE FLIGHT PATH IS CLEARLY INDICATED BY THE TWO SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS SHOWING THE OUTLINE OF THE OBJECT AS SEEN AGAINST THE HORIZON AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT FROM THE SIDE.
