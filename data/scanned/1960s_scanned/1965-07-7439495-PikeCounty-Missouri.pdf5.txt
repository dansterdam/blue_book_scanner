"Incident to two U.F.O. Sightings
What? - States a strange man-made object
Size - 20-25 ft long 
Course - NorthEast to B.C. 

Dear Sir -
Our sighting is located in Pike County, Missouri. It was about 10:30 PM on Sunday night. Our family was out in the yard walking under a light sky - it was a relatively light night. We all noticed a light in the sky, which at first we thought was an airplane. As it came closer, however, we could see it was a strange man-made object - not an airplane at all. It was larger than any commercial aircraft and had no lights or wings. It was shaped like a long cylinder and had a reddish-orange glow that seemed to come from the entire body, rather than from any specific source. The object moved silently across the sky in a northeast direction, crossed over our house, and then continued on toward the northeast. It disappeared from sight after 3-4 minutes. 
We were all amazed and puzzled by this sight. None of us had ever seen anything like it before. I am a college professor and my wife is a high school teacher, so we are reasonably educated and objective people. We feel sure that what we saw was not an airplane, satellite, or any other known aircraft. It was definitely a strange man-made object that we cannot identify.
I would appreciate any comments or information you could provide about similar sightings in this area. We will be watching the skies more closely from now on.

Sincerely,
