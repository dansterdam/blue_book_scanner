The image does not contain any photographs, only a hand-drawn sketch. The sketch appears to depict the shape of the observed object, showing three distinct circular shapes connected by lines.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? There were 4 objects. One seemed to fade out and come back again.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: none
b. Color: Bluish-green, Red (on the sides), Always followed by yellow

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? It was like the diameter of a doughnut covering a huge orange shaped down close to the ground it seemed to be.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
