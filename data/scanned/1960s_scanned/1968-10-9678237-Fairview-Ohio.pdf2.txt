27. In the following drawing shown, there are two lines connected. These are marked "A" and "B" on the curved line to show how high the object appeared above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "A" the same curved line to show how high the object appeared above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place on "B" the same curved line to show the compass direction that you first saw it. Place on "A" the same curved line to show the compass direction that you last saw it.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" the beginning of the path, the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
