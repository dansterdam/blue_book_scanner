2327 hours, Received call from Maj Cottrell at 57A93. He received this message: "At 2022 We observed bright light in the sky on my radar unit. It was tracked for over 10 minutes and then lost. A call was made to Capt Smith, who was monitoring UFO, and he saw the object passing. He said it was a very bright light moving at a very high rate of speed. Telemetrican A/3C Patterson and A/2C Crunch also observed object, but could not give estimate of size or speed."

Is it possible to furnish the OD with a forecast of satellites which may be observed in the Dayton area?"
