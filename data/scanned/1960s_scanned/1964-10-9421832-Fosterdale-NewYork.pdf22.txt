POLICE CHECK "FLYING SAUCER"
Two Haverhill Police Officers spent several minutes investigating a report by two youths that they had seen a bright, round shaped object that had "a glow to it" was hovering above the trees off Broadway near Forest Street.
Sgt. Robert C. Dunsmore and Officer John McLin were the officers called to the scene at 8:15 p.m. after the youths, William Chasse, 16, of 18 Marble St., his brother, Robert, 15, and Robert Sancy, 18, of 53 Webster Rd., Methuen, made the report.
No details as to nature or other evidence of the sighting were available.
This morning Police Chief William A. Ross, after reading the officer's reports, said, "This seems to be the end of it. They searched and found nothing." Officers at the police station concur in the belief that they had seen something "up there."
