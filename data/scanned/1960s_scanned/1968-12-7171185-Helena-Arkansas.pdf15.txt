The image contains two illustrations. The top illustration is a compass rose with directional labels. The bottom illustration depicts a person standing on a road or path, with mountains or hills in the background. There is also a smaller inset image showing a person standing in a landscape with mountains or hills.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOUR ENCOUNTER WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON MOVED FROM "X".

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON AS IT LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATELY SHOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE SKETCH.
