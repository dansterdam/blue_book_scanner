Description of sighting: While I on the morning of Oct 2nd 1967 at about 7:10 a.m. I observed a round object (no wings, no tail) hovering in a northwest direction about 200 feet above the ground. It was absolutely silent and appeared to be about the size of a small automobile. It was grayish-white in color. After about 2 minutes it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. I immediately related the incident to my husband and to several neighbors.
