The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a handwritten document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

This would be the only thing in the sky. So that there would be no other known craft or objects as close at hand. They had no explanation for what they saw. They were a mile and a half from the object. They waited until it left, but did not see it go. They did watch it for about 15-20 minutes. It seemed to be hovering or stationary - whatever you want to call it. They could not estimate the size, as they had no point of reference. They did not hear any noise at all. The object seemed to be glowing or illuminated in some way. That is about all they can tell you. There is a man involved with this report, but we have been instructed not to identify or name any individuals in the images.
