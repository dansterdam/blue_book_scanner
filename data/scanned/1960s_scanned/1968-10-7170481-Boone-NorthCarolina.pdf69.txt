There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing a "DAILY WEATHER MAPS" section with text describing weather maps and information.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES OCT. 28-NOV. 3, 1968

The text describes the purpose and contents of the weather maps, including details about surface weather data, precipitation, temperature, pressure, and other meteorological information. It also provides instructions on how to interpret the weather maps.
