The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, describing a sighting of a "saucer-shaped" object.

Text from the document:

"entitled, "My Saturnian Lover," photographs of saucers, the moon seen from an approaching saucer, moon scenery, and could buy a record of Saturnian music; and, if they stayed up late enough, the conventioneers would see mysterious blue lights at play and observe a balloon-shaped saucer that rose opportunely from behind the barn.

We have gone from the sincerely attested reports, made by people highly respected in their communities, to sheer charlatanism--but one must take care to step carefully to distinguish the daisies from the cow dung. 

I have three more items to place before you, the Jury. "Last Monday night, about 10:30," Hamilton said, " we were awakened by a noise among the cattle. I arose, thinking that perhaps my bulldog was performing some of his pranks, but upon going to the door saw to my utter astonishment an air-ship slowly descending over my cow lot, about 40 rods from the house. Calling my tenant, old Haslip, and my son Will, we seized some axes and ran to the corral. Meanwhile, the ship had been gently descending until it was not more than 30 feet above the ground, and we came within 50 yards of it. It consisted of a great cigar-shaped portion, possibly 300 feet long, with a carriage underneath. The carriage was made of glass or some other transparent substance alternating with a narrow strip of some material. It was brilliantly lighted within and everything was plainly visible--it was occupied by six of the strangest beings I ever saw. They were jabbering together, but we could not understand a word."
