Dear Mr.

Please excuse the delay in answering your inquiry. Due to our heavy workload at this time, it has not been possible to provide
a prompt reply.

An evaluation of your sighting was made and our conclusion is that your object was Venus. On 29 April 1966, Venus was rising at an azimuth of 110 degrees and on elevation of 15 degrees. At that time it was the brightest object in the eastern sky, next to Jupiter being next to Venus. As it brightest, can be seen in daylight with the proper atmospheric conditions. The object you observed exhibiting fantastic speeds, when viewed through haze or mist, Venus appears to perform erratic maneuvers. This can be explained by the refraction of light through varying atmospheric conditions.

I feel sure this is an explanation of what you saw. You mentioned that "the object was like a bright star but was not twinkling like a star." This other characteristic indicates the Venus observation. Atmospheric planes are often seen near Venus and can give the illusion of angular motion.

Thank you for your interest in Project Blue Book.

Sincerely,

VICTOR QUINTANILLA, Ir. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
