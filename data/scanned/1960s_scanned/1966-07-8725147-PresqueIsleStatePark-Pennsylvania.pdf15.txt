The image contains two photographs. The left photograph appears to show a saucer-shaped object in the sky, which is described in the text as a "saucer" that was "shot" by a newswoman. The right photograph shows a 5-sided or pentagonal object, which is described in the text as something that was seen by the Gemini 10 astronauts.

DID FLYING PENTAGON
ON GEMINI 10 ASTRONAUTS
By JACK JONES, Daily News Staff Writer
Gemini 10 astronauts John W. Young and Michael Collins brought back an unidentified object from space with them on their recent flight, it was learned today.
THE ODD THING is that the object does not seem to be found.
The astronauts' report on this "saucer" or whatever it was that they saw and photographed during their three-day mission has not been made public. Life magazine attempted to explain them away, but found the explanation left a lot to be desired.
THERE IS LITTLE doubt that the astronauts saw something. There have been other reports of unusual aerial phenomena observed by space travelers, indicating they do pick up strange sightings in the sky which official sources have not yet explained.
To test the letter theory, staff photographers mounted a camera with a telescopic lens on the roof of the Dayton Daily News building and got a picture of the planet Venus, showing it to be about the same size and shape as the object the astronauts photographed.
Well, here goes that "man-in-the-moon" stuff away.
