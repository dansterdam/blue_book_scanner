I WENT OUT TO LOOK AT THE STARS, AND SUDDENLY I SAW A VERY BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SKY WHICH APPEARED TO BE MOVING RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SKY FROM WEST TO EAST. IT WAS COMPLETELY SILENT AND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE AN AIRPLANE. IT WAS SHAPED LIKE A DISC OR OVAL AND SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN A STAR. I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

30. What was to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
Boy
