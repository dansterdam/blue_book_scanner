Transcription of the text in the document:

On the night of March 9, 1967 at approximately 9:45, our dog, who is getting rather old, was out barking, a rather anxious, loud barking. We looked out, and there was a very bright object in the sky to the west of our barren farm. The object was brighter than any star or planet in the sky, yet not quite as bright as Venus, approximately 30 miles west of us.

At first changing color, and then it stood still. Then the light went out, and the outline of the bottom of the object could be seen, but the light came back on. For a while there was a reddish glow around the edge, and then the light went completely off, and it seemed to disappear. The outline could no longer be seen.

We watched this for some time, probably 30 minutes, and then my husband and two neighbors (Clarence and Ray) came in, and since they also saw this, I am reporting it. It landed just behind the trees, and at that point, we could see nothing more.
