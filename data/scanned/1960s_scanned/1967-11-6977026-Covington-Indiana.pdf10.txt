Dear Colonel Stiles:

This letter has reference to a civilian, Covington, Indiana, who would like to share with the Air Force pictures he has made of a UFO sighted in his area.

He would like to have permission to meet with Lt. Marango, TDPT, UFO Aerial Phenomena Officer, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, in order that he may personally present his photographs.

It would be very much appreciated if you could make appropriate arrangements to insure that Lt. Marango will be able to see Lt. Marango, when he makes the trip to Dayton.

My thanks for this service.

Sincerely,
John Myers
