The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text output from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: The object made a whistling rushing sound, much like a jet plane.
b. Color: The object was a brilliant white and had a yellowish-white glow around the edges.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object would have been covered by the match head. If this experiment is performed at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Approximately the size of a 25 cent match stick held at arms length would have covered the entire object.

19. Draw a sketch of the object if possible and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

(There were no visible exhaust trails or vapor trails.)
