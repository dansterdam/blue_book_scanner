JUN 8 1967

Dear [REDACTED],

Your recent unidentified observation, detailed investigation revealed the planet Venus was probably responsible for most of the sightings. Venus, with a similar magnitude of approximately -4, was very prominent in the sky. On March 6, 1967 at 6:30 p.m., Venus would have been on an azimuth bearing of 290 degrees at an elevation of 15 degrees.

You mentioned throughout the report that the object often appeared as a bright, only brilliant object. It appeared to move at times and change colors. When stars or planets are viewed low on the horizon, as Venus was in this instance, their light can be distorted by the earth's atmosphere causing them to appear to move and change colors.

The earth's atmosphere actually acts as a prism which refracts and causes the incoming rays to be refracted by the atmosphere. The display of lights and colors on the horizon are then looking through this prism-like layer of air. This, in effect, causes an astronomical phenomenon to occur, due to the distortion in the sky. 

From the information submitted, it does appear that Venus was responsible for the majority of the sightings. The Air Force has thoroughly investigated the occurrence for the months of March and April, describing observations similar to yours.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
BARNETT B. YOUNG
