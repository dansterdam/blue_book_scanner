AT KIRKSVILLE, AFS, MISSOURI. SAGE AUTOVCN 4-9-4-611. COMMENTS: ALL AREAS WERE CHECKED FOR POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE OBJECT, BUT NONE WERE FOUND. TWO OTHER PEOPLE, A DOCTOR AND NURSE SAW THE LAST PART OF THE OBJECT. UNABLE TO GET A REPORT FROM THEM AT THIS TIME. THE OBSERVER WAS VERY SINCERE IN WHAT SHE SAW, AND WENT INTO MANY DEMONSTRATIONS OF HOW THE OBJECT LOOKED.
