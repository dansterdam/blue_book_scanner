Dear sir,
I should have written this letter to you sooner, but I had so much work to do that I just never seemed to get around to it. On the evening of August 3, 1965, my wife and I were driving along route 101 in new hampshire near the town of exeter. It was about 11:37 p.m. and we were traveling west toward the newfields-exeter area. As we drove along, my wife suddenly exclaimed, "Look at that!" When I glanced up, I saw a large brightly lighted object moving rapidly through the sky. It appeared to be round and was giving off a bluish-white light. The object moved silently and very swiftly, in a straight line, and was visible for about 10 to 15 seconds before it disappeared from view. My wife and I continued driving and shortly afterwards saw the object again, this time hovering over a field near the road. We stopped the car and watched it for a few minutes. The object seemed to be about the size of a car and was surrounded by a glowing halo of light. After a short time, the object suddenly shot straight up into the sky at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. We resumed our trip and did not see the object again. I have never seen anything like this before and I am quite puzzled by what we observed. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with any information or explanation regarding this incident. Please let me know if you have any questions or require any additional details from me. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
