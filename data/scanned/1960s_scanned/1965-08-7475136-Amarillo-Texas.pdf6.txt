The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and some text. The diagram shows a curved line with compass points and a compass rose, which appears to be used for instructing the viewer on how to sketch the motion and direction of an observed object or objects. The text instructs the viewer to imagine the object observed, draw a picture showing the motion and direction, and answer a question about multiple objects observed and their direction of travel.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you see at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where the object was the last time you saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Give a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
