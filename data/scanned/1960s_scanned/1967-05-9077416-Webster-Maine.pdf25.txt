Reference your UFO observation and photograph of 13 May 1967. The report identified in the photograph has previously been evaluated and identified as a conventional search light or searchlight shining on the clouds. Close examination of the original negative indicates the same conclusions.

Enclosed are your original negative and your print. Thank you for your cooperation and patience in this matter.
