(2) The object was observed by the witness for a very short time and was described as being of small size, light-colored, and moving at fairly high speed on a relatively straight course. (3) The height, exact size, and other specific identifying characteristics of the object were not determined. (4) Attempts to locate the object or obtain any additional factual information have not been successful.

(5) Based on the limited data available, it is considered that the observed phenomena was most likely some type of aircraft, weather balloon, or other familiar aerial object. No evidence has come to light indicating the object was an unidentified flying object of extraordinary nature.

(6) If any further information is obtained which would indicate the observed object was of an extraordinary nature, this office will be advised immediately. However, at the present time, the available data does not warrant further investigation or special reporting.
