Three luminous circles of light were sighted and tracked on radar at the Grano de Oro Airport near Maracaibo. They were flying near the main runway, about 7:30 p.m. A class in instruction for radar operators was in session and personnel observed the objects and saw the radar display. They were only observable visually. Visually, they appeared to be elongated with a halo in the center. (The classic disc with a dome on top.)
