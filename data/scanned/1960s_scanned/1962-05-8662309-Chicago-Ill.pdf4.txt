FLYING SAUCER REVIEW

- Another convert - 

The Newcastle Journal and Associated Newspapers, England 
On May 9 the Newcastle Journal published an interesting article about the sighting of a flying saucer by a former RAF pilot. 
The account read:
Mr. John went out one evening, as he often does, to have a look at the skies over Hexenville, England. He uses a telescope for this purpose. At around 8 p.m. he caught sight of a shining object approaching from the south. It was cigar-shaped and silvery in color. 
After watching it for a time, he was convinced that it was not an aircraft. It seemed to be suspended in the air, not moving. He watched it for about ten minutes, then it suddenly shot off at a tremendous speed, disappearing from sight in just a few seconds.
Mr. John, a former RAF pilot, says he is now a firm believer in flying saucers. Although he is normally a very skeptical person, this experience has convinced him that such objects do exist. 
He says: "I have never seen anything like it before. I am quite sure it was not an aircraft of any kind. The thing was hovering motionless in the air for several minutes, then it just took off at an incredible speed. I would not have believed it if I had not seen it with my own eyes."
