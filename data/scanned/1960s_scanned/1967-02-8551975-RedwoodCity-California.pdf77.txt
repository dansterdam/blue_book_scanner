This replies to your recent correspondence concerning your unidentified observation. Examination of the submitted data fails to reveal a positive identification, primarily because of the lack of essential data such as flight characteristics, angular velocity, and how the object disappeared.

No other unidentified flying object reports were submitted to the Air Force from the vicinity of Grayson, Michigan for 8 February 1957.

At this late date a meaningful scientific investigation is not possible. It is important for an individual to report his or her observation to the Air Force as soon as possible after the sighting. This enables the Air Force analyze to perform a comprehensive investigation.

The submitted information will definitely be added to the present data for possible future reference.
