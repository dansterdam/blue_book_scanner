27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the horizon line where the object was first seen. Place a "B" on the horizon line where you last saw it. Draw how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
