Mr. -----
Ontario, Canada

Dear Mr. ------,

I thank you for your letter describing your observation of the unidentified flying object on August 15, 1960. As you may know, we have the responsibility to investigate such sightings, particularly those involving missile sites. However, there is no particular assignment nor the facilities to day any investigation at this time. We have therefore forwarded your letter to the Air Force for such investigation as they may feel is warranted.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We appreciate your responsibility for investigating this type of occurrence.

Very truly yours,

James A. Hootman, Secretary
Investigations and Contributions Board
