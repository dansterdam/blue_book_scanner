1. It is necessary to know that we are making a complete investigation could not be made. It is important that an individual report their sightings immediately to the nearest Air Force Base.

2. It is necessary to know if there was any air activity in the area described in the report. However, the information from them did not find anything that fits their description. 

3. Because we cannot make a comprehensive evaluation of your sighting, we felt it necessary to classify your report as Insufficient Data.
