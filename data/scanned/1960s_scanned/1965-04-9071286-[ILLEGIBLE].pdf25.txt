Dear Mr. ---

Reference is made to your letter reporting your observation of aerial objects which you could not identify. The following evaluations are presented in regard to your sighting of 13 April 1965. 

1. The observation of 13 April 1965 has characteristics consistent with that of conventional jet aircraft which were probable in the area at that time.

2. The sighting of 29 April 1965 contained information that the object/phenomenon was observed for approximately 8-10 minutes. The description and duration of the flight is consistent with the observation of a conventional jet aircraft.

3. The sighting of 1 May 1965 from 9:15 to 9:50 PM is consistent with the observation of aircraft operating at night, such as training flights or military jet aircraft.

In conclusion, the nature of the observations did not indicate the presence of any unusual or unidentified aerial phenomenon. Rather, the evidence suggests the sightings were of conventional aircraft operating in the area at the time of the observations.

Sincerely,

Dan Lewis, Illinois, 60-555
