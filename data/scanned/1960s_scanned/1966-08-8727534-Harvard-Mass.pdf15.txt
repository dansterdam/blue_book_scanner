Dear Sir:

This letter is in reference to the fact that I saw an unidentified flying object on the evening of August 7, 1966 at about 8:00 to 8:30 o'clock pm. The object was sighted over Harvard, Massachusetts.

The object appeared to be disc-shaped and was completely silent. It seemed to be hovering and then moved off rapidly toward the north. The object was visible for approximately 5 to 7 minutes.

I am a careful observer and have had some experience in observing aircraft. This object did not resemble any aircraft I have ever seen. It was much larger than a conventional airplane and moved with incredible speed and maneuverability.

I would appreciate it if you would investigate this sighting and let me know if you have any information about unidentified objects observed in this area on that date.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
