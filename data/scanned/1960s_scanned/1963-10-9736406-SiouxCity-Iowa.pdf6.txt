SUBJECT: Report for Information on Resulting Operation

1. 29th BcoD Wing (28 BOEING)
Ellsworth, South Dakota, 57706

Reference your 1st Indorsement, 23 Jan 64, to our letter, AFSI-ETT-1-1, 13 Jan 64, subject: Request information. Give inclusive statements on any information obtained as a result of the 28 BOEING B-52 aircraft and F-105 aircraft sighting and P-33 MOSS flight in the immediate area of observation. Please include results of immediate search, field investigation, evaluation and conclusions formulated.

2. We believe that a BICO phenomenon case concerning the 28 BOEING B-52 aircraft was involved. The pilot of the 8-52 aircraft believed to be Capt (illegible) USAF is convinced the phenomenon was real and may have been a hostile electronic device or vehicle. The pilots during the alleged operation with the F-105 aircraft believed to be involved. The pilots have definitely identified an object in the 28 BOEING B-52 area observation. Results of any possible search for a physical object is apparently negative, but this is possible since the object would be airborne and possibly maneuverable to escape detection. Estimated time of observation approximately 120 nautical miles from the observer. Possibly, further detailed study of recordings could disclose additional information.
