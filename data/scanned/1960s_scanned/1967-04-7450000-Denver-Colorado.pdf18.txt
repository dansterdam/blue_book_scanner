Transcribed text from the image:

" 22 3 Unidentified lights were seen Floating Over a residential area being observed by many witnesses. There was another bright light which had beams radiating from it and it seemed to be another object that was being observed at the same time. First man said he had his hand on the key of his car to leave and he got his kid and went but he'd just move it just a little ways while he went and got his wife and when he came back out the lights were dimmer but they were still there. They were only in sight for around 5 minutes, what, whenever it was possible for them to be in sight-not too long. I heard Gillen say in the flight and said them too. I don't understand why the very same element doesn't air commit the same information. "
