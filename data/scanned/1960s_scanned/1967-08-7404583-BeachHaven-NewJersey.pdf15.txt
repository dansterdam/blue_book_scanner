The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a form or questionnaire related to a UFO sighting. The form has several questions for the witness to answer, including details about the object's appearance, movement, and behavior. There is a space provided for the witness to draw a sketch of the object or objects they observed. However, no such sketch is present in this particular image.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will output all the textual content found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Went straight up and vanished into clouds

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what: 

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound ___ As silent as all
b. Color ___ Brilliant white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
1/4

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
