GUYAHOGA FALLS, OHIO----APRIL 5, 1963
TOLD THE OBSERVER SR. AREA. - APPEARED AS WHITE BRIGHT LIGHT, APPEARING TO BE SUDDENLY RISING. LIT UP WHILE HOVERING AND STARTED DESCENDING SLOWLY FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. WHEN LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW FACING EAST, HE SAW A BRIGHT ORANGE-YELLOW LIGHT ABOUT 120 YARDS AWAY. HE SAID THAT THE LIGHT COULD BE COMPARED TO THAT OF A "VERY BRIGHT AUTOMOBILE LIGHT" THE WITNESS THOUGHT IT MUST BE A PLANE - IT FLASHED AND GREW DIM AND AGAIN BECAME VISIBLE. SLOWLY IT INCREASED IN INTENSITY UNTIL IT ACHIEVED ITS HIGHEST BRILLIANCE, AND AGAIN IT SLOWLY DIMINISHED. THIS PERFORMANCE WAS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES.
THE IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE LIGHT WAS APPEARING AS IF ON SOME CONTROLLED PLAN INVISIBLE TO HIM. IT FINALLY DIMINISHED NEVER TO RETURN. NOT SEEN SINCE.
