The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a project blue book report, with handwritten text.

The transcribed text from the document is as follows:

"34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 21 May 1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The sighting occurred at about 10:00 PM. I was on a county highway about 1 1/2 miles S of Piqua, Ohio, headed N when the object appeared. It remained in view from 1 to 2 minutes approximately. It was low & moving slowly in a S direction at about the same speed as a car. It was a large flat object, white or gray in color, with no lights that I could see. It did not make any noise & I think was oval in shape. After disappearing over the trees to the S, I did not see it again. I called the Air Force Base at Dayton & reported the sighting but they said they had no other reports of it. I always thought it might have been some kind of aircraft but was not sure. There was no moon out & it was a clear night."
