Possibly object landed in an ideal place, as far as effecting the precision of the observation was concerned. The observers had picked up the object through binoculars and had watched it through binoculars and with the naked eye for about 30 minutes.

The object was estimated to be about 15-20 feet in diameter and about 6-8 feet thick. Both observers reported that the object appeared to be metallic and seemed to emit a "faint glow". Its speed of movement was estimated to be around 25° to 25°. The object was reported to make a "slight buzzing" sound.

After this sighting, the police were called and eventually the word reached Capt. Bankard of the Hartford Police. Capt. Bankard got in contact with the individuals involved, interviewed and obtained additional details from the witnesses. All of this had been in the process of verification.

Dr. Hynek was in the v icinity at the time and supposedly picked up some stones that were allegedly fallen debris from the object.

Dr. Brown, and indicated that the object was clearly not a meteorite, and its characteristics precluded it being a typical atmospheric phenomenon. However, he could not positively identify it as extra-terrestrial in origin.
