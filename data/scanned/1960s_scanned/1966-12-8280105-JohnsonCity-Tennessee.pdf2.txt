Dear Sir:
The following involved Peggy on Sunday, December 4, 1966. Peggy was out in the driveway of a friend's house and for some reason looked up and saw what appeared to be a large white object in the sky coming from the south and heading to the north. It was very high and traveling very rapidly. Peggy called to her friend Alma who was working in the yard to look up and she also saw the object. It appeared to be shaped like a half-moon and seemed to be glowing. The object disappeared from sight very suddenly, leaving no trail. Peggy said it appeared to be about the size of a school bus and was approximately 1/2 to 1 mile high. The sighting lasted only about 20 seconds. They were both quite excited about what they had seen. Peggy said she has never seen anything like it before and could not identify what it was. I am passing this information on to you in case it might be of some interest. 

Sincerely,
Jess Prickett
