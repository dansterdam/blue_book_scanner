Dear Sir,
I appreciate the interest in the sighting. I have filled out the form to the best of my ability, and cannot add any additional information.
In this letter I received it stated that I would also receive one Blue Book. As of this date, I have not received a copy of the Blue Book. Since several of us have been very interested in UFO's, I would appreciate any information available in the Blue Book.
I thank you very much.

Sincerely,
