The object was a bright, white light, without defined shape or edges, like a bright star at first, then gradually changing to a yellowish-white color, with an effect of seeming to move closer and closer, increasing in size and brightness constantly. This occurred over a period of several seconds. The brightness was almost blinding at the peak. It then seemed to fade out and disappear.
