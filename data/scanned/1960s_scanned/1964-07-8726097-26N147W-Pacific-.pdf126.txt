Flying Bowl
Some time ago while flying over the Pacific Ocean at about 26N 147W I observed several unusual bright objects appearing in the sky. They appeared to be round or bowl-shaped and were extremely bright, almost luminous. They moved in a very erratic and rapid fashion, making extremely sharp turns and stops. I watched them for several minutes before they disappeared from sight.
