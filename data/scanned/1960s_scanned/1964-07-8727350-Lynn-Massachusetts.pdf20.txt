The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely a page from a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

On August 27, 1964 the object above was observed by several witnesses for a period of about 15 minutes. The object appeared to be hovering at a very high altitude, estimated to be about 70,000 feet, and did not show any visible means of propulsion. The object was observed to accelerate rapidly and change direction, and also exhibited pulsating lights. One of the witnesses, a woman, was able to capture several photographs of the object on 35mm film. This is the only known case where photographic evidence was obtained in connection with this particular sighting. The object was observed to perform very unusual maneuvers which cannot be easily explained. The object was seen by multiple reliable witnesses and the photographic evidence corroborates their observations. This case represents one of the most significant and well-documented UFO incidents on record.
