There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a scanned document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads:

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT. IF THE MATCH APPEARS TO COVER THE OBJECT, NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. RETURN TO STATION TO RUN THIS TEST. RECORD THE ESTIMATED ANGULAR SIZE OF THE OBJECT AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING. ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE MOON'S DIAMETER THE OBJECT COVERED WHEN OBSERVED.
