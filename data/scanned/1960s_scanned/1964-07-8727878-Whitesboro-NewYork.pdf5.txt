Text from the document:

August 17, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

1964. This is in reply to your letter of July 27, 1964, concerning several objects observed in the sky on the evenings of both July 25th and 26th.

It is believed that the objects you observed were some 150 miles distant over Whitesboro, New York on the night of July 25th, at approximately 9:51 p.m. When first seen, they were just visible in the northeast, remaining stationary for about 20 minutes, then appearing to move closer together and fade from view.

They probably gave the appearance of being station-ary and sheen flashing up since they were so distant, the details and viewing them from the ground made accurate observation difficult.

Until they can be studied down in more detail upon recurrence, it must remain an unexplained sighting, but one that is commonly reported.

Sincerely,

MASON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information

Mr. [redacted]
Whitesboro, New York
