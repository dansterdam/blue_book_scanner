The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document, containing handwritten responses to a questionnaire about the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? - YES - WHEN PLANES CAME NEAR IT - IT BLACKED OUT LIGHTING SO BRIGHT AT FIRST - 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? - YES

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? - YES - BIG GLOWING OBJECTS - CLOUDS MOVED

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound - NO SOUND AT ALL; b. Color - PALE YELLOW AND ORANGE ORANGE - COLOR FLASHED THRU

18. We wish to know the angular size. This is to match a stick at arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, what would the measurement have been? - ABOUT 12 INCHES OR MORE - COVERED A FAIRLY WIDE AREA - LOOKED ABOUT 5 YARDS AWAY (APPEARED) - WIDTH ABOUT 1/8 OF THE SKY - BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT AND FLASH WITH IT

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you can such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. - UP - DOWN - NO VAPOUR TRAIL - NO WINGS - UP - NO PROTRUSION - JUST ROUND - POUNCED

The document appears to describe the sighting of an unidentified aerial object, with details about its appearance, movement, and disappearance. The witness provided handwritten responses to the questionnaire.
