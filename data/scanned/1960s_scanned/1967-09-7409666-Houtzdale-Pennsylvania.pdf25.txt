Dear Sirs,

I am writing to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object in Houtzdale, Pennsylvania on September 16, 1967.

At approximately 4:50 a.m. on September 16, 1967, I observed a bright white light hovering in the sky. The object remained stationary for about 15 minutes, then moved rapidly to the north and then back to its original position. This occurred several times over the next 20 minutes. The object then moved out of sight.

If you require any additional information regarding my sighting, please let me know.

Sincerely,
[redacted]
