? This object was egg shaped and it stayed stationary after moving north, then it moved rapidly to the north east, then went south east, and then west. It made three moves and stayed stationary in between each move. It was not visible at all before and after these moves it made. Each move took about 2 to 5 seconds. I was in my car on a clear night.
