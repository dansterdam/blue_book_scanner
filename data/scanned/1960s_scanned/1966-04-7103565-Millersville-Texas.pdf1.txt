When the sun came out the observer saw a gleaming object. It looked strangely close as if it seemed to move along the side of her car for about four miles. Then the object seemed to cross the highway behind her and she continued watching it in her rear view mirror. There is an aluminum fence gate, some distance from the highway, that could have caught the sunlight and gave an unusual appearance.
