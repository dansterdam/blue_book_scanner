Went to bank about 4:30 pm on the way to the garden to find out whether to contact FTD and my car stopped running 2/3 way there. Didn't think much about it being unusual, but 20 mins later the motor started again as I was driving to my gas station. Stopped again at the gas station, got gas and headed for home. Parked in my driveway and had normal evening. Next day I called FTD to report my car stoppage and they seemed interested that it happened near the time of the sightings. I had not reported my car stoppage before as I did not think it was related to the sightings. There was no damage to the car or any indication as to why it stopped. I have had my car checked and no mechanical problems found. My sightings were on: 6-19-64 at 8:15 pm - 2 bright lights - one went from East to West and one from West to East at a high rate of speed. 6-22-64 at 8:24 pm - 2 bright lights - one went from North to South and one from South to North at a high rate of speed. Both sightings were at low altitudes on a clear night. No sound from the objects. Rama
