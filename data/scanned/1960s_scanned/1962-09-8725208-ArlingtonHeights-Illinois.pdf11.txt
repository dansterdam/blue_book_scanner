27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the skyline to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" to show the direction in which you first saw the object, and a "D" to show the direction in which you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" as the path of the object, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
