12. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT WAS SOLID OR TRANSPARENT, WHETHER EDGES WERE SHARP OR FUZZY. DESCRIBE THE SHAPE AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE. INDICATE IF IT APPEARED AS A LIGHT OR EXHIBITED COLORED OBJECTS. LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR PHENOMENA IN SPACE.
The light was about 3 stories tall with self luminous objects charged from around the outside of its shape. The objects appeared to be different in size but all appeared round in shape. The light observed was very bright in nature and different in appearance from anything I had seen before. It was unlike the glow of a light or the illumination from any type of aircraft that I am familiar with. It appeared to be solid in nature and not transparent. The edges of the objects were sharp and not fuzzy.
