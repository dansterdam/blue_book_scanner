Dear Sir:
After writing my previous report, it occured to me that I should add some additional information that I had omitted and which may have a bearing on the case.
At least I think so. My husband, who is one in a million to my way of thinking, says one night about a week ago ight our attention was attracted by a light, My husband thought that he might have forgotten to turn off our porch light, and went to see what the movement was. His attention was attracted by a ball of light only, it moved and extinguished. We looked like fine but it were from the porch to side and it was a making some kind of signal. It was a round ball of light only, it last about 10-15 seconds and then extinguished, We could not account for this as I said nothing to my husband since my previous report.
I trust this additional information may be of some help in your investigation. I would not want to be accused of withholding anything.
