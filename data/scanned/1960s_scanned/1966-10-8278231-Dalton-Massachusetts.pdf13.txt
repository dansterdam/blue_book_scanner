I want to mention concerning the sighting of UFOs reported here. I was out with the boy friend of a girl friend of mine, and we were taking a walk about 9:30 PM on October 1, 1966. We noticed five objects in the sky, which appeared to be hovering, moving in any direction very quickly and silently, one coming in at 10:00 to 10:30 for a while and then disappearing. Sometimes they moved away very swiftly and then would come closer again. One comes in at 10:00 to 10:30 the same spot every night, and things seem to be increasing. On Monday night, our friends could hardly have a complete report as they two other adults not awake and 5 children age 5 to 12 were also watching, said that time I never put watch on but it was not later than 11:00 when they came home. I trust now that we have gotten an idea of what is going on that time might now we are awakening about to these phenomena.
