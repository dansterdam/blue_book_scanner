The image contains two photographs that appear to be related to a UFO sighting report. The first photograph shows an object described as a "glowing object" in the sky. The second photograph shows a close-up view of what appears to be the same or a similar object.

The text in the document states:

From the Antarctic camp came a report that an unidentified flying object, maneuvered at terrific speed over Wilhelmina Bay near the scientific base.
Camere man James Barretts, confirmed that several persons had observed the strange object.
The object, viewed at amazing speed, maneuvered suddenly and was gone in a matter of seconds.
The object itself was very difficult to distinguish in detail, but was observed to be round in shape and to emit a brilliant glow. It was watched for several minutes, then disappeared as swiftly as it came.
He also reported that the object had caused electrical interference with radio communications and with the equipment of an automatic weather station in the vicinity.
Then came a report from Otis where a "flying man" said he saw the thing.
"It was a glowing object, larger than a star and the size of a half dollar held at arm's length. It came in from the west, descended about 1,000 feet and hovered in the sky over the town for about three minutes and then was gone in a flash."
Finally, the very day that Mariners was observing most intensely, a "curious glowing object" was reported over the Mariners control tower, said to be under radar observation for several minutes.
