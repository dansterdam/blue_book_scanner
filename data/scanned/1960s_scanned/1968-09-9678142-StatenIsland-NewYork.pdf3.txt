The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The document appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report, likely from 1968, referencing an incident that occurred in Staten Island, New York.

Here is the text from the document:

Dear Sir:
I saw four (4) objects at about 7:30 P.M. on April 30, 1968. They appeared to be in a straight line and remained in the same position for about 15 minutes. The objects were white in color and had a bright light in the center. They seemed to be at a high altitude. When one of the objects would flicker, the others would flicker also. I could not make out any shape or size. The objects finally disappeared from view one at a time.

Yours truly,
[Redacted]
