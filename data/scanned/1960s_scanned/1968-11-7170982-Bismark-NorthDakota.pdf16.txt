The image contains a detailed compass rose diagram in the top half, as well as two sketches in the bottom half depicting a person observing something in the distance.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE SIGHTING. (PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE COMPASS ROSE ITSELF.)

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. THE ARROW SHOULD INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT. IN THE SKETCH ON THE RIGHT, YOU CAN DRAW A LARGER SKETCH.
