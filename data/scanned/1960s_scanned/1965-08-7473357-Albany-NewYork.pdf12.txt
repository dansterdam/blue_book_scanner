Text extracted from the document:

Could be alerted. Then people in authority would definitely spot them. No one will listen to a mere housewife arguing on her back porch watching flying saucers. These Americans keep this all quiet as near the squares that ever look up. But squares can be patriotic and concerned about the security of their country. Also, it is a mighty snug and careless procedure to just build up charges to all these reports. These champions sipping, high and mighty men in charge of our security, that think they know it all, never to give one peep out of us raucous common riff-raff. Someday and maybe not so far in the future, when the Champagne glasses are shaken out, this will all be seen as it is already too late. They will say, "We should have listened and we should have believed."

They are depending on Reader to patch up all these things. Did the mighty minds ever stop to think, other countries know about Radar too? Maybe, know how to get missiles past or fly them too. Low, or other methods? If an attacking world leader becomes I am thoroughly burned up. After I reported sighting these objects - an announcement was made on our local television station to the effect that these flying objects were sighted in this area. After careful investigation by military, this conclusion was reached. "By the time anyone got around to investigating these reports, the objects in question were gone."

I drew pictures of what I saw. If anyone is interested in seeing them and hearing my description, (and believe me, someone should be), I will be glad to show them and explain what I saw. And Believe Me, I saw them!
