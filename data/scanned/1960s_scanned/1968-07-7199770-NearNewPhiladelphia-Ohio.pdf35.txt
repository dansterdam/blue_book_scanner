There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a document containing handwritten text.

TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

A PARTIAL STUDY - (CAMAKIS CLOUDS)
WITH LARGE OBLONG AREA IN SKY

MY PARTIAL STUDY:
(1) OBJECT (U.F.O.) ONE
IN VERY, VERY WHITE
WITH LARGE
& QUICK MOVEMENTS

(2) NO APPARENT SMOKE (EXHAUST)
OR NOISE OF ANY SORT - JUST SUDDEN
STOPS & VERY RAPID 96 MOVEMENTS.

PHOTO WAS TAKEN 7/7/68 (SUCH
A BRIGHT DAY') BUT MOVEMENTS TO
RAPID FOR CAMERA).

AT THAT POINT THE OBJECT SEEM TO DISAPPEAR
INTO BLUE SKY WHERE WE COULD NOT GETTING
ANY PICTURE OF IT WHICH I SINCERELY WISH I COULD.
