There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document, possibly a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Dear Sir,
Enclosed find letter from
trained observer and follow-up report on visual sighting of unidentified flying object.
