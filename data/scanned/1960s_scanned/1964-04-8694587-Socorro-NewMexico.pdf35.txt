The following is a resume on the unidentified flying object sighted by Mr Lonnie Zamora, of Socorro, New Mexico on 24 Apr 64. Results of the investigation so far, conclusions reached by ATIC, and courses of action in continuing the investigation.

Background Information:
At approximately 5:45 PM on 24 Apr 64, an unidentified flying object was observed by Mr Lonnie Zamora in Socorro, New Mexico. The object sighted by Mr Zamora had left distinctive markings on the ground at the scene. Investigation by the New Mexico State Police. The object sighted by Mr Zamora had landed briefly in a desert area and then took off, leaving markings on the ground.

The area was secured by Sgt Chavez and the Commanding Officer of the N.M. State Police, who made notes of the physical evidence and measurements of the ground markings, and ordered an initial investigation of the sighting.

Evaluation:
(a) Septs 8:44 1944 (o) were made and several local news reports of the sighting had become quite disturbed with the amount of publicity and reports of little green men and descriptions of the object.

The account of the sighting given by Mr Zamora is the most reliable. Albuquerque Journal, 27 April 1964 and comments by USAF representatives indicates that Mr Zamora, a 52-year old senior patrolman, is a completely reliable and credible witness. The officers at the scene, according to Maj David Moody, were very impressed with Zamora's sincerity and thoroughness.  

Results of Capt Holder's investigation were received. Interviews with Sgt Chavez and other officers concerned with the initial investigation revealed that the sighting was legitimate and there was no indication that the object was being perpetrated.
