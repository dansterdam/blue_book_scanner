Dear Colonel Tappart, 

Since the Air Force has advised that they have no interest or original data on the reported events of 27 Oct, I am returning to you the questionable data sent me in reference to a report made by the Douglas Air Force Base.

As far as I'm concerned, the whole incident is a closed case. I don't care for any further details concerning the sightings which were the object of that particular report. Our clients of pictures while I was an office hound. You probably have rules and regulations to go by, but I must say you certainly conduct an investigation in a bland manner.

Sincerely,
