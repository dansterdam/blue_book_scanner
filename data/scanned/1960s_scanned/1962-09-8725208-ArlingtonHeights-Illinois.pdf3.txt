Text transcription from the document:

This report that described a reaction, nonresemblance..thing is rather hard to analyze. There appeared to be streamer effects or streamers emanating from the something that was in the sky. It could have been a disc or circular object. A bright light was seen with some other lights surrounding it. The beam of light from the center was rather intense and there appeared to be a glow or illumination around the edges. The moon was seen at this time but it is not clear if it was related to the phenomenon observed. The track pattern of the lights indicates the object was moving very rapidly and the glow diminished rather rapidly. The back of lights was quite amazing and could have been a display of some type of electrical or magnetic forces or an artificial propulsion system. Did they see any craft is not clear but there appeared to be some kind of object which could not be identified with any known aircraft.
