The image contains two illustrations. The larger illustration depicts a compass rose with directions labeled around the circumference. The instructions above the compass rose indicate that the observer should place an "X" on the compass to indicate the direction of the phenomenon when first seen.

The smaller illustrations on the bottom show two different landscape views, with a figure standing in the foreground of each view.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

In the sketch below, place an "A" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a "+" at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. That is, schematically show whether the movement of the phenomenon appeared to be straight, curved or zig-zag. Refer to smaller sketches as an example of how to complete the indicating sketch.
