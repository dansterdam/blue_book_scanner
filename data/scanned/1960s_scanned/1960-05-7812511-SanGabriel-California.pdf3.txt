I received a seargents rating in 1928 from the R. O. T. C. at Missouri University. In the Infantry. I hate communism, and please excuse the typing and secretarial errors. If you all want me to place an atomic bomb by dropping me and it on some future or distant battle field or enemy installation don't hesitate to call on me. I so often think of the Niemcienz line and everything was figured out on paper to be perfect but the Germans did great new fox holes for their front line seargents and corporals and we all know what happened.
