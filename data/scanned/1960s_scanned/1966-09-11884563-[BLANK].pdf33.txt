The Commander, 
Kirtland AFB.

Dear Sir,

Whilst reading through a copy of the 1952 "report on unidentified flying objects" I came across a reference to a method of investigating UFOs proposed by the Kirtland AFB in the early 1950's.

I would greatly appreciate if you would inform me whether you have any data on file at your base regarding the above proposal which went under the code name "Project Bounce."

Yours sincerely,

[Signature]
