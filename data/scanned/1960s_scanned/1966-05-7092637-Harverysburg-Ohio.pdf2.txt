The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

The text on the page is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 5 July 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The massive sighting which occurred was the object which was first seen as a slight glow in the distance and as it came closer it increased in size and luminosity. It seemed to be a very large circular object with lights which changed in color from red to blue to white. It moved very slowly at first and then seemed to accelerate as it went out of sight. The object was observed for a period of about 5 minutes and was seen by several persons in the area. The other object or objects were not seen until after the large circular object had disappeared. I would say the sighting was an extremely unusual one and very difficult to explain. I certainly do not have the answer and would be very interested to hear the other reports and findings on this incident. Thank you.
