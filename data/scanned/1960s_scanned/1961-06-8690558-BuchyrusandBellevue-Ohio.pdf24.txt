Text extracted from the document:

23 December 1951

Your recent letter to the Aeronautics Electrical Intelligesce Center of the Aireraft Warning Service was received. Your letter has been referred to this office for appropriate action.

The object viewed and reported by you is probably due to some astronomical or meteorological phenomenon, and not an aircraft or unidentified flying object. The ATIC has investigated many such reports and found them to be of natural origin. The fact that the object was observed for some time is not conclusive evidence that it was something other than a natural phenomenon.

As to any final conclusion as to the identity of the light observed, we are unable to make a definite determination from the information you have provided. We must, therefore, conclude that this information is inconclusive.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM E. COLEMAN, JR.
Major, USAF
