The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire with various questions about a reported UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - A very definite sound, very sharp, very audible.
b. Color - Metalic looking, deep red color, changed to white.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object it covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About the size of a match at arm's length.

19. Draw a picture showing the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch all the details of the object (such as wings, projections, etc., and especially a trail or vapor trails).
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[A hand-drawn sketch is included, depicting an elliptical object with a trail.]

As near as I can determine, because somewhat confusing.
