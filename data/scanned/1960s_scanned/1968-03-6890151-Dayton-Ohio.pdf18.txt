The document does not contain any information that would allow me to identify a human. I will simply transcribe the text as an OCR system would:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
MOVED ON

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound NONE
b. Color APPEARED SOLID

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
APPEARED SOLID

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc.; and especially any vapor trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
