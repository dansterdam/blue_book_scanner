ONLY CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION = USAF FLARES BUT WRO RULE THIS OUT UNLESS IMAGINATION PLAYED A LARGER PART THAN SUSPECTED. IF SIZABLE LIGHTS AS FROM VEHICLES APPROACH GULES THOUGHT TO BE A CLUSTER OF DIM YELLOW LIGHTS (GLOW BELOW BRIGHT ONES). SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT MOVEMENT WAS REAL AND NOT DUE TO CAR MOTION. IT HAS INDICATED US THAT IT WILL DO LONGER SUPPLY US WITH DATA THAT POINTS TO ALL INCIDENTS AS "UNKIN" FLARES MAY POSSIBLY HAVE SEEN OBSERVED
