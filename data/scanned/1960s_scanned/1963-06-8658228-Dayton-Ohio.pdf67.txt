The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon, and the instructions ask the viewer to imagine how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. The second sketch shows a larger sketch with an "A" and a "B" to illustrate the position of the object when you first saw it and an example of how to complete a larger sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
