The image contains a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There are two sketches or drawings provided, one showing a "Static Rotating" object and the other showing several circular objects. The text in the document includes responses to questions about the observation of the UFO, such as how the object disappeared, whether it moved behind something, and a description of the object's appearance and behavior.

The text of the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? it disappeared very fast behind a cloud  then reappeared and went on disappearing behind a very fine cloud you couldn't see through

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)  Yes  No  Don't Know
If you answered YES, then tell when:   it moved a very fast off, they went U.F.O.? 

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)  Yes  No  Don't Know
If you answered YES, then tell what: in front of

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound like a ring-ping ball of white energy
b. Color like a ring-ping ball of white energy

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? ABOUT 1/2

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
