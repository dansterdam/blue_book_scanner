SPACE PAPER ANALYSIS TO NEGATIVES - On May 9, 1961, the results of the photographic analysis on the Eagle River, Wisconsin case were forwarded to the Project Blue Book office in Dayton, Ohio. The report indicates that a photographic analysis was conducted on two 35mm negatives received from the observer, a Mr. [REDACTED]. The negatives were sent by the observer for expert analysis to determine if they represented a "genuine anomaly" or were a hoax.

The analysis found that the negatives showed no retouching or alteration, and the details and characteristics of the images were consistent with normal photographic processes. The report states that "from the photographic evidence alone, it is not possible to determine whether the object photographed represents an actual 'flying saucer' or some other unidentified aerial phenomenon, or whether it is the result of a hoax." The report concludes that "the photographic evidence is inconclusive" and that further investigation would be required to make a determination.

The report also notes that the observer, Mr. [REDACTED], was interviewed and provided additional details about the sighting. However, those details are redacted from the document.
