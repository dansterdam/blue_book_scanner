The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter from the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) addressed to Major William T. Coleman of the Department of the Air Force Office of Information, dated August 23, 1961.

Here is the text from the document:

NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE
ON AERIAL PHENOMENA
WASHINGTON, D. C.
August 23, 1961

Major William T. Coleman
Department of the Air Force
Office of Information
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Major Coleman:

Thank you for your letter of August 28 promising to advise us of the Air Force conclusion in the May 30 sighting.

Considering the location of the June 2 sighting, it appears that the white object could have been the same one viewed by several persons on the Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania. She reported a cigar-shaped UFO accompanied by several smaller objects.

At first all objects were motionless, then the smaller ones moved around the larger and all of them were observed at close range in a brilliant afternoon, and the objects were visible in the NE sky.

We would appreciate a check on the conclusion of the May 30 sighting. You may recall the large bright light which was observed up and down the Atlantic coast for a considerable distance. A follow-up report mentioned a bright light which accelerated and moved rapidly southward.

According to the record, the missile fired from Vandenberg at 9:14 P.M. was not observed in this area. Can you clarify this?

Sincerely yours,
(Signature)
Secretary of NICAP
