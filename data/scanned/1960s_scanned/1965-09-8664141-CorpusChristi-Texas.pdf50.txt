CIASS: As all the crew members saw a strange flying object in Aries on 26 August 1965 and the previous declarations made by some of them, it was decided to identity their experience.    

I saw the object approximately at 15.30 hours in Aries and it was a brilliant star-like object yellowish-white in color and had a strange flickering effect. It oscillated and then It disappeared very rapidly, traveling in a northerly direction. I saw it for approximately 2 minutes and I do not believe it was a meteorite. I am Capt. O'Neill, DC 65 LAN FLT. #901 as Chief of Flight Operations. I have never had a similar experience in all my years of flying.  I didn't believe in "THEM" until I saw this. 
The speed of 500 - 600 knots. The night was cloudy and without stars -- the object was not part of the atmosphere. I could not be identified as a planet, star, or satellite. It was not affected by the atmosphere and I observed it at a distance of about 30 miles. Suddenly it disappeared at a tremendous speed, without leaving any trails.
