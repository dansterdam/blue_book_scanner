The text in the document reads:

"But now I can't call them hallucinations. I have just done a thorough study of the case and I am convinced that they really saw a strange, metallic, saucer-shaped object, that was hovering over the ground at a low altitude. It was about 50 feet in diameter and 10 to 15 feet thick. The object was seen by three men and they all described it in the same way. There was no evidence of any kind of propulsion system, no smoke, no exhaust, no noise. It just seemed to float and hover above the ground. At one point, it took off at a terrific rate of speed, literally vanishing from sight. The men were badly shaken by the incident and I am convinced that they were telling the truth. I can't explain what they saw, but I know that they saw something very strange and real. I would appreciate any advice or suggestions you might have about this case."
