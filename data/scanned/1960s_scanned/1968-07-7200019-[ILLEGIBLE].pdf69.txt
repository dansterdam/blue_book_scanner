There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

Transcribed text from the document:

IT WAS TOO LIGHT TO MAKE ANY MINUTE OBSERVATIONS ON THE CAPTAIN THAT
CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE CRAFT. HIS APPROACH WAS VERY BRIEF AND HE SOON
RETIRED WITH IN SHAROOW THE CRAFT.

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE HELD A PLANE AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT SUCH AS A STREET
LIGHT POST; WHAT WAS ITS APPARENT SIZE WHEN COMPARED TO THIS OBJECT AS VIEWED BY THE OBSERVER. THIS WILL
ENABLE US TO ESTIMATE WHAT THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE CRAFT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. 

ABOUT ONE SIXTH OF 1T.
