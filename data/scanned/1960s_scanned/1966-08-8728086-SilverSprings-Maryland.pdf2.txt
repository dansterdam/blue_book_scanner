Dear Sirs:
This is to report a sighting of an unusual object on August 12, shortly before 11:00 p.m. The circumstances are as follows:
My wife and I were in Silver Spring, Md., exploring for meteors, as it was the night of the annual meteor shower. At approximately 10:55 p.m. I noticed what appeared to be a bright light in the southern sky. It moved very slowly, and appeared to be larger and brighter than a meteor. Its initial location was somewhat between Altair and Deneb. It moved very slowly in a northeasterly direction for several seconds, and then suddenly disappeared. It had adjacent to or following it, a smaller object which followed the same path and also disappeared. The entire situation was somewhat puzzling, and appeared not to fit the pattern of a meteor or shooting star.
It moved a bit further than the apparent diameter of the moon before disappearing. The distance could not be estimated. I was an amateur astronomer, but this event was entirely new to me.
Further information will be of interest.
Sincerely,"
