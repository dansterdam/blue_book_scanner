Transcription of the text in the document:

One sighting at approximately 1:00 AM, on August 8, 1966, near Donnybrook, North Dakota, was investigated by AFCSI personnel on August 14, 1966. The witnesses were JW, age 53, and RP, age 40, both farmers in the Donnybrook area. The witnesses reported seeing a bright light, "bigger than a full moon," rise over the horizon and stop almost directly overhead at an estimated altitude of 1,500 to 2,000 feet. The object remained stationary for approximately 10 minutes before descending vertically and disappearing from sight. The object was described as a solid white light, approximately 60 to 80 feet in diameter, with no visible wings, tail, or appendages. The object illuminated the surrounding area and cast shadows on the ground during the sighting. The witnesses were unable to detect any sound from the object.
