There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document containing text.

The text in the document is as follows:

"were several instances of the same general type during the period Oct. 1967 to March 1968 which were investigated and determined to be normal aircraft. The sighting on 9 October 1968 appeared to be different and the observer, a high school student with an engineering background, seemed to be a credible witness. His description of the object and its maneuvers did not fit the pattern of known aircraft. It was the opinion of the investigator that the sighting was probably of an unconventional phenomenon, but no positive identification could be made. Additional information from the observer and any further sightings in the area may shed more light on the nature of this incident."
