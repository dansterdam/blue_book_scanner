Text in the document:

started watching it at about 10;30 and it seemed to be about 30 ft. above the ground (about 100 ft.) and it got lighter to the sky. I had advised on from by them. The UFO seemed to be about 50 ft. across and stopped right over our car, about 3 ft. and the light of us. It was hovering about 3 to 10 ft. of the ground. I got a good look at it and I knew we had never seen anything like it. I saw something metallic I seen something was something up passed us. My husband drove on about 90 mph, away the direction we had watched. I looked up once and the UFO was directly over us going might along with us. when we reached the edge of the road we looked and it was gone.
