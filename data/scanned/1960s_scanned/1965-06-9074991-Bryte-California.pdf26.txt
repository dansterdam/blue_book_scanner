The image does not contain any photograph or visual elements other than the handwritten text. It appears to be a page from a document containing a detailed narrative or report, likely related to a UFO sighting or investigation.

The text in the document is as follows:

About 7:20 P.M., June 9, 1965, Mrs. Pearlie Harden was standing in the kitchen of her home at 1260 Harding Blvd., Bryte, California, and she looked out the window and saw a large, bright, round object in the sky. 
It appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly. It was very bright and seemed to have a bluish-white glow around the outer edge. This glow was of an intensity that lighted up the surrounding area to a great extent.
The object appeared to be about the size of a large automobile tire. It was visible for approximately 7 to 10 minutes. Mrs. Harden watched it for the entire period. She was very much excited and amazed at the sight.
About 2 minutes after the object first appeared, a small, jet-like object appeared and seemed to dart toward the larger object from the north. As it approached the larger object, the larger object suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very rapid rate of speed and disappeared from sight.
The smaller object then turned around and went back in the direction from which it had come. Mrs. Harden said she had never seen anything like it before and that she was quite frightened by the experience.
Mrs. Harden is a woman in her 60's, of average intelligence, and appears to be a reliable witness. Her report is considered to be of definite interest and deserving of further investigation.
