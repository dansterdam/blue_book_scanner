The image contains two diagrams. The first diagram appears to show the viewing angle and elevation of an object, with instructions for indicating the observer's position and the object's location. The second diagram appears to be a compass or gyroscope, showing the direction of the object's travel.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show the high and low points of the object where you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show the low and high points where you last saw it. If the object was hovering (skyline), show the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and an "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
