The image appears to be a black and white photograph, depicting a blurry, indistinct object in the sky. The object appears to be a small, round shape against a largely empty, featureless background. There is no other discernible detail in the photograph.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program tasked with investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during the 1950s and 1960s. This photograph appears to be part of a document or report from that historical program.
