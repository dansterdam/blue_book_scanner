This call appeared to be rather routine on its face. The test proved negative on this sample. 

Soil sample #3 was obtained at 4 feet from the center of the area. The nitrate test on this sample was also found to be negative; however, coloring in the test kit possibly indicated a very faint trace of nitrates.

The soil sample #4 was obtained at the same location as #3 but was taken 18 inches below the surface, in the brown/orange layer. The nitrate test proved to be positive, showing the presence of nitrates.

All tests and attempts to obtain evidence of the hole or impression in the right side of the broken tree were unsuccessful. It was decided that no test would be necessary on this sample.

All tests performed indicated were performed to determine if any unconventional explosives were used. Our conclusion is that the central hole was not the result of an explosion of conventional chemical explosives. Chemical explosives usually leave nitrates at explosion sites.

Report on soil gases from Battelle-7:

Gasseous matter is found to consist of a grayish-brown surface layer over a region or disturbance which may indicate the site of Glassboro sighting. The soil gas sample taken from this layer appears to contain an excess water content, probably from vaporization of water due to heat emission from the ground. These well-delineated soil gas accumulations indicate they occur primarily along existing faults or fractured bedrock within the area. The steep edges of the accumulation indicate a source that is escaping gas to the surface.
