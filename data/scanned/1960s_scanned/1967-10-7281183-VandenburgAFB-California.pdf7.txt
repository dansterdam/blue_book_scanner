Vandenberg Sighting Report
As Mr. [REDACTED] wrote in a letter dated November 13, 1967:
It would seem that most of the inexplicability of the events in this case (and possibly in many others) arises not from the facts themselves, U.S. Air Force, but from the associated attitudes, conditions, etc. that became attached to them when they were considered in inappropriate juxtapositions. The way in which this was done at the time underoperational pressures and even subsequently provides, in my opinion, a most important object lesson.
It does indeed! The lesson is that the flap could have been avoided: the aircraft need not have been scrambled. It is unlikely they will be again at Vandenberg under those circumstances, but it could happen someplace else - unless the Vandenberg experience is communicated, through the adoption of appropriate operating procedures or in some other manner, to other operators of powerful tracking radars.
Thanks.
Special appreciation is extended to John Payer for his assistance in arranging the meetings, discussions, and subsequent radar experiments that led to the probable solution of this case. He went out of his way to help.
