Nottingham mystery
We are indebted to Mr. G. M. Denison for sending us the following account which appeared in the Nottingham Evening Post of July 30, 1963:
"Bridge mystery: two fishermen at Trent Bridge (Nottingham) were startled to see a mysterious object in the sky at about 9.15 p.m. yesterday (Monday).
The bright object appeared to be suspended from a larger body. It hovered for a few minutes, then shot upwards and was lost to sight.
The fishermen, who have been fishing at Trent Bridge for years, said they had never seen anything like it before. They described it as being the size of a large orange ball of fire, which appeared to be giving off its own light.
For an explanation - UFO over Bristol are flying past ever since September.
