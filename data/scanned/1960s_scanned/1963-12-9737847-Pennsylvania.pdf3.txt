UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
PHILADELPHIA 4 
Flower and Cook Observatory
Dear Sir:

Over Pennsylvania sightings of UFQ's are becoming quite frequent and many reports, particularly on the formation and orbits of these objects, are coming in to the Air Force Station at Washington, D.C.

Many reports, particularly on the formation and orbits of these objects, are coming in to the Air Force Station at Washington, D.C. If you have any information that would be helpful, we would be very grateful to receive copies of them. We are particularly interested in verified sightings by trained observers, as they would provide more reliable data. Your assistance will be greatly appreciated, and any information that you can supply will be a valuable contribution to the Air Force for any research that they may undertake.

Sincerely yours,
