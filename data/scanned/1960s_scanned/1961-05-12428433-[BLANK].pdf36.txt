INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
EXPANDABLE STRUCTURAL FORMS
FIGURE 3
One of the breakthroughs we had was the development of a material called "Aramid" which is a very tough, lightweight material on the upper right side of Figure 3. This is a typical flat panel that we used for pressure hull and doesn't go to a sphere but is flat. We call this "Aramit". When you put pressure in them, the tendency is to expand more than the dimension of the threads. It was able to take the loads and actually shape the structure. This shows you that you inflated this body you would have an air foil-shaped device. See Figure 6. Many shapes from the straight-type tubes to the drop-shaped structure are showing you are nothing but pieces of cloth side surfaces very close together. To make carpet they cut the drop surfaces to make them gas-tight, seal the edges and pressurize internally to make a rigid structure. This is nothing more than I mean, if you might visualize it, as shown in Figure 6. With pressure, you get tension in the surfaces and you have an I-beam with the web of the I-beam. It is difficult to get material lighter than this. This is why we look at it as one of the world's lightest structural materials. It will remain still and hard as long as you maintain pressure in it.
