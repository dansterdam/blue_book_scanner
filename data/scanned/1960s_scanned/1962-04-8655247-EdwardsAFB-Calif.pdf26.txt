War College Associate Courses At
ASD Termed Highly Successful
The Air Force recently announced that
the Associate Course in Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD) at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, is going on and has been termed highly successful by the Air Force. This course is designed to provide education for key civilian personnel and military officers in the Air Force. 

A voluntary program, the new associate
course was established in September 1961 and has been receiving enthusiastic endorsement and support from employees of the Air Force. The course is providing a means for personnel to become better acquainted with the Air Force, its mission and functions. This cooperative effort is considered an important step in bringing the Air Force and civilian communities closer together.

The War College associate course is based on the same curriculum as the regular Air War College course at Maxwell AFB, Alabama. The purpose is to train civilian and military personnel in order to improve their capabilities in analysis and decision making, and to prepare them to be presented as candidates for key positions in the Air Force. 

Upon finishing the course, students
are given a certificate of a completion of a three-month study program.

Lieutenant Nicolas was born in Lebanon. He attended the University of Beirut from which he received his bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering in 1957. After coming to the United States, he attended the University of Alabama where he received his master's degree in aeronautical engineering in June 1959. He then joined ASD in August 1959. He attended the SOS course from August 1961 to June 1962. Upon his return to ASD, Lieutenant Nicolas was assigned to the Engineering Design Branch. In this assignment, he conducts studies of automatic and semi-automatic flight control systems for aircraft.
