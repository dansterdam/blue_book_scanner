6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. THEN DRAW A LINE CONNECTING THE TWO POINTS. THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B" THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS APPARENTLY STRAIGHT, CURVED OR 2IG-ZAG.
