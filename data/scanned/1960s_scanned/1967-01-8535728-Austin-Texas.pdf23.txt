There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

(2) The object was described as an extremely bright light, estimated as approximately 35 feet in diameter, and which appeared to be at an altitude of 500 to 1,000 feet. The object hovered very slowly at this altitude for approximately 45 seconds, the light being pulsating or blinking.

(3) the object then moved in a northeasterly direction at a high rate of speed, being lost to sight in approximately 15 minutes.

(4) During this time, a light switch in the house was flipped off and on, as if a light was turned off and then on. 

(5) The witness stated he had never seen anything like this before, and that it appeared to be as bright and large as a house on fire.

(6) The object was visible for approximately 15 minutes, giving a clear and steady view.

(7) The object was saucer-shaped for approximately 15 minutes, giving a little time to observe it.
