UFO Observation, 9 February 1968

Fort Riley, Kansas 66442

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from Groveton, Missouri, of a sighting on 9 February 1968.

2. The observer sighted an extremely bright light and also heard a loud noise like a jet aircraft. The object was observed for several minutes at a high speed above a person's head, and had a pulsating rhythm.

3. The noise started with two or three louder and higher pitched pulsations, which were two or three times louder than the noise it made afterwards as it moved away.

4. Airport Radar has suggested that this was possibly the sighting of a satellite. However, the observer did not indicate any vertical motion characteristic of a satellite, and the pulsating rhythm and sound characteristics are not typical of a satellite.

In the event that you have any helicopters from your field or have operated in that area in recent days, we would be interested in determining if you have any data which could substantiate this sighting or offer other clues. If so, was there any activity in the area at that time? If so, was there any activity in the area at the time?

4. To obtain this data, we realize that you must do quite a bit of coordination and research. However, we would appreciate your answering the following:

5. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
