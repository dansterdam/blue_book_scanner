There are two sketches/illustrations present in the image.

The first sketch shows a curved line with an object or explosion at the top. This appears to be an instruction or example related to how to draw or depict a UFO sighting.

The second sketch shows two larger scenes. On the left is a landscape with a road and buildings in the distance. On the right is a smaller scene showing a person standing in a landscape.

As an OCR system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object (flying saucer) was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show its position when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
