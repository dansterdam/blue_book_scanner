1. ALPHA (Lt. Col Denmark)
1. Attention is drawn to a previous report by Capt. J.J. Kaliszewski (also spelled incorrectly as Kalisziesvski) on same case, dated 10 July 1962.
2. The investigation reports by Major Keyhole and his official investigation team revealed new information and amounted to confirmation and amplification of the Capt. Kaliszewski report, dated 10 July 1962.
3. Matter determined to be of major interest and therefore a more detailed investigation was instituted and a full report is covered in the letter of Major Keyhole to Director, Special Air Projects, dated 27 June 1962.
4. Also, it is apparent from Mr. Vinson's letter that Major Keyhole and others are attempting to force certain inferences upon how the case be reported. Er. Vinson is justified.
