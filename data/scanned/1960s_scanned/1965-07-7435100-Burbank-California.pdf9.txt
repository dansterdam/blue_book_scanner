The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Dear Mr. [redacted],

The negative which you submitted to the Air Force for analysis is returned.

The double that in the prints could be caused by reflection and distortion. The selection has been examined for any evidence of the unusual object as reported. A copy of the photo analysis report is enclosed for your information.

Thank you for submitting your report to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
JOHN D. ROUNTREE
Lt Colonel, USAF
