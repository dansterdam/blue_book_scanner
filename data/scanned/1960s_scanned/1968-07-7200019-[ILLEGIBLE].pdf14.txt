There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which is a report on an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

Text in the document:

Dear Sir,
This will reply to your undated letter, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).
Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the reason for your sighting. If you will complete the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.
Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Intelligence or Counterpart Office. This is important, as upon receipt of such reports, an investigation is undertaken, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.
We appreciate your bringing this matter to our attention. Your willingness to cooperate by looking at the categories of "observed characteristics" on the Product Blue Book report is included.
Sincerely,
JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
