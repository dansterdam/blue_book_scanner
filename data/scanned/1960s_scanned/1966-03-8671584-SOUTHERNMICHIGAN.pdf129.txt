NEW YORK—MARCH 28— WASHINGTON—FLYING saucers AND OTHER unidentified objects apparently have the Capitol Hill quite disturbed these days, the article states.

The article discusses how members of Congress have been receiving reports of UFO sightings and are considering investigating the matter, despite some skepticism. It mentions the Air Force's Project Blue Book and how the committee does not take all sightings seriously, though there seem to be more reported sightings lately. The article also discusses some specific sighting reports and the reluctance of Congress to investigate the matter fully.
