The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON? It appeared to be a curved curve coming up on the horizon to where this object was located. The brightness, night, and suddenly caught my attention. As it approached, the light or beam seemed to be aiming at me for a short time, so I immediately realized this was not an airplane or any other known objects.
A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR? The object simply floated from a yellow-orange color to a violet and smaller straight up at a very high rate of speed. It was completely out of sight in less than 15 seconds.
