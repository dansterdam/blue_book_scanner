11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Obj. was round, approx size of a baseball. There was a hazy film trailing the obj. Observer couldn't describe it. At first obj. was hovering about 1/2 mile in the air. Observer went out to watch it, went back into car when obj. flew above the car. Tried to start car. Car started after obj. had dimmed slightly, directly towards the observer. There is object had anything whatsoever to do with the car, if any more tech data needed, however, it was a possible aircraft sighting.
