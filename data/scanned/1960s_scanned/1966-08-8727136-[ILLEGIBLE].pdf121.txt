6 SEPT 1966
It appeared suddenly, as a satellite, floating across the horizon. We watched it carefully as it suddenly disappeared then reappeared about ten minutes later. It seemed to dart erratically, left our left, if we faced it, moments hesitation, and a flit to the right. Then, another hesitation, a dart to the left, the pattern continued for the object left our sight.
It was its motion, back and forth that attracted our attention.
