Transcribed text from the document:

The celestial object was observed by 3 individuals at approximately 8:20 PM, March 17, 1960 over the Newton, Ohio area. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes and described as circular in shape, having a red light at the front, and white lights at the rear. The object appeared to be approximately 20 feet in diameter and was moving at a high rate of speed, estimated to be 300 to 500 miles per hour. The object was observed to make a slight course change and then descend rapidly until it disappeared from sight. The investigators were unable to determine the exact nature of the object, but it was not identified as any known aircraft.
