19 Jul 66

Conversation with Mr. Lot - 744 (19 Jul 66) of Barnes Aerial Advertising, Winchester, Kentucky was flying the night of 19 July in the Dayton area. Mr. Lot was flying a 1959 Champion Aircraft with an advertising sign that had a series of lights on the bottom of the plane. We plane landed at Montgomery County Airport to refuel before circling the Dayton area. Aircraft was advertising for Borchers Ford's 1966 close out. Lights on the bottom of the plane are series of lights from other side of the craft in the distance, the advertising appears only as a row of blinking lights. Area representative will call us about this and the surrounding area.

Mr. Lot contacted WF SAFCON on each flight in this area. He has been flying around the Cincinnati Area since April, refusing to do the Greater Cincinnati Airport.

Mr. Lot said that a person would have to be directly underneath the plane in order to read the sign. Mr. Lot is going to send the Project Office a picture of his plane.

Mr. Lot informed the project office that he would be flying over the Dayton area on the evening of 19 Jul 66, 2030 - 2230 hours.
