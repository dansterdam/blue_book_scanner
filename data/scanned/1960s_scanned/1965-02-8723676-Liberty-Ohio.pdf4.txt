REPORT OF INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LIBERTY, OHIO - 8 FEBRUARY 1965
1. ABSTRACT: On 8 February 1965, at approximately 2120 hours EST, an unidentified flying object was observed by two witnesses in Liberty, Ohio. The object was described as a circular, glowing light maneuvering at high speed in the sky. Photographs were taken of the object.
2. DETAILS OF OBSERVATION: The two witnesses, who were husband and wife, were driving on Belmont Avenue in Liberty, Ohio when they observed a glowing, circular object in the sky moving at high speed. The object was estimated to be approximately 50 feet in diameter and was observed for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing from view. The witnesses immediately stopped their vehicle and the husband took two photographs of the object using a 35mm camera. The photographs show what appear to be two oval-shaped markings or objects.
3. INVESTIGATION: Investigators from Project Blue Book interviewed the two witnesses and examined the photographs. The witnesses were found to be credible and the photographs appeared to be genuine. No explanation for the object observed could be determined.
4. CONCLUSION: The object observed is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The photographs provide physical evidence of the sighting, but do not conclusively identify the nature of the object. Further investigation is recommended.
