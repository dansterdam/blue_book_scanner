PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 23 Oct 60, 21/2143 MDT
2. LOCATION: 15 miles SW of Twin Falls, Idaho
3. SOURCE: 
4. NATURE OF OBJECTS: 1) Other (PROBABLE: ROCKET LAUNCH) 2) Astro (POSSIBLE STARS/PLANETS)
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 - 7 minutes
7. COURSE: Stationary - Visual
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer was driving his tractor when the headlights and radio went out. He noticed a large light rising over the horizon. From within this light as much brighter and smaller light appeared much like a 4th of July rocket except it did not explode. The larger light gradually faded until it disappeared.

COMMENTS: A Minuteman rocket was launched from Vandenberg AFB, California at 1939 PST of 21 Oct 60 (2139 MST); and appears to be the stimulus of the visual sighting. There is no evidence that the visual sightings and the electrical failures are related. The sightings of 11 and 13 Nov are possibly stars and/or planets.
