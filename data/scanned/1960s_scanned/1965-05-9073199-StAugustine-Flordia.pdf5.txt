There is a hand-drawn diagram in the image, showing a trajectory of movement from northwest to southeast, with the annotation "SOUTHEAST LAST VIEWED" and an approximate time of 45-50 seconds.

Dear Sirs:
On the night of May 1, 1965, at 9:00 P.M. (E.S.T.) myself and three other observers saw an unidentified object travel across the sky over St. Augustine, Florida.  It was first observed to the northwest and was thought to be a satellite, but soon began to dim and disappeared. We viewed the object from 9:00 P.M. (E.S.T.) and it disappeared.

Very truly yours,
