PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 65-118
SUBJECT: UFO Report
LOCATION: Santa Ana, California
DATE: 3 August 1965

PHOTOGRAPHY
P NO: 1-2 AXIO Prints & Investigating Reports

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to work order No. 65-106 submitted by Major Quintonilla, Jr. (TDEW/UFO) requesting photo analysis of attached three photographs showing alleged unidentified flying objects. The following analysis was conducted from these photographs.

2. ANALYSIS: Although it is not possible to disprove the existence of the objects from the camera information submitted and distances to the object quoted in the report by Mr. M, on a set of negatives examined the following was determined by Mr. M. Those objects were in approximately the same part of the frame in all three photographs. The center white stripe on the road and the object appeared to have the same sharp image. Therefore, it is felt that the object was on the same plane as the center white stripe of the road as a factor, it was estimated the size of the object to be approximately one to three feet in diameter and the distance to the object to be approximately 20 feet above the ground.

3. A test was conducted by the FTD Photo Analyst and Photo processing personnel with the identical camera (1.10A using 200 ASA film - Focal length 129mm, Aperture f.32 at 1/300 second) and on a distance conveying tray, placed in the approximately 8 to 12 feet high at a distance from the camera of approximately 20 feet. The results of this test photography showed surprising similarities between the object on the test photography and the object on Mr. M's photography.
