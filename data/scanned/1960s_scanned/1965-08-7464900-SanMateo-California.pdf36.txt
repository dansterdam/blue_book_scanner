Camera Crews On Lookout
For UFOs Over Arkansas

FORT SMITH, Ark. (AP) - Unidentified flying objects have been sighted over Arkansas, and television camera crews are trying to get proof that unidentified flying objects are in the air. 

"We'll be shooting both color and black and white film," Delaney said in a telephone conversation with station KFSA, who is himself convinced that unidentified flying objects are visiting the area. "I'm convinced that a ground crew for a well-known national network has been alerted and will be out shooting film."

Delaney said he and a group of four others have witnessed the sightings for about five minutes on two different evenings. "They were brilliant red and green but changed to a brilliant white under observation," Delaney added.

Meanwhile, police at Jonesboro in northeast Arkansas, say they have received numerous reports of unidentified flying objects being sighted over Jonesboro about 8:30 p.m. Monday.

Nick Dowe, a Jonesboro resident, told police he watched five objects through a telescope for about five minutes. "They were brilliant red and green but changed to a brilliant white under observation," Dowe said.
