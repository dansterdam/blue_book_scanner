I am on an amateur observer and I am very interested observer and I am also a student who is very interested in science and astronomy. I am not quite sure that I saw what I saw and I am not sure of the exact details. But I was taken by surprise when I saw the object and it seemed to be something not ordinary. It seemed to float in the air and had a pale blue glow around it. It did not make any noise that I recall. That is about all I can say about what I saw. I did not get a closer look as the object went off very rapidly in a zig-zag pattern which was quite unusual.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
I have not told anyone about this, as I was not sure what I saw and did not want to appear foolish. I am just giving you this information in case it helps in your study.
