No Case (Information Only)
20 December 1962
Milan, Italy

A policeman in Milan, Italy, claims to have seen a saucer with two hemispheres inside it. The policeman, Francesco Rizzi, and another person, name not stated, were on the street when they saw the following statement: It was in a flat oval, aluminum-colored appearance. It was from a flying saucer that had an aluminum-colored appearance. They were not more than three meters away from it. The saucer had two strange-looking mechanisms on its sides, which they thought to be portholes. The two men were dressed in luminous clothing, with strange dark patches on them. The policeman was directed towards the saucer, and then it took off vertically.
