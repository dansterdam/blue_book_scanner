There is no photograph present in this image. The image displays a handwritten document with text that appears to be a continuation of a UFO report or observation. As requested, I will now proceed to produce and output all the text found in the document:

UFO form continued

Laying on the back of the time, may up the sky is stars,
so I see this object. it seems to me passing
the area - in which it is moving, I estimated
the altitude a little less than 10,000 feet.
it seemed to move for the most,
it continued to move on a straight course - but
continuing on straight course,
no one seemed in a hurry, or carrying on. 
a ground connection might have been
there ignored. this object, except 
my vision of this strange
monster, never it looked for a
good landing sight?
