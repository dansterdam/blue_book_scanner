GREAT LAKES FIREBALL
A statement from page 79.
When I watched the object it seemed to be much closer than it really was. When I first noticed it I had started to drive off while looking back, and as I was looking back the object seemed to be very close over the trees.
If the meteorite had fallen a few miles west it would have been in sight at least one minute, as it traveled across the sky with the short visibility of the bright illumination that it was only carried east.
William Werner, a regional director of the Civilian Saucer Intelligence Corps, stated that Duell of Wooster, Ohio, who directed the search at the time, reported the object to be visible briefly for about one minute, then it disappeared with no sound.
It was reported that after about five minutes, the object reappeared and was visible for about another five minutes, traveling off-white in color, ending as "a thin line" until at least 50 to 60 percent of the object had disappeared.
