The image contains a hand-drawn sketch. The sketch depicts a top-down view of an object or objects in the sky, with the path of motion shown by an "A" and a "B" at the beginning and end of the path. There is also a compass-like diagram in the lower right corner.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the course to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the course to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Estimate the angle of elevation in degrees.

28. Draw a diagram that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were moving.
