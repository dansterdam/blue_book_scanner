Ramey Home Residents
Sight 'Objects In Sky'
The second sighting of "objects" was reported to the police in Ashland, Ky., by Miss Gertrude Ramey, founder and superintendent of the Ramey Home, a home for the aged.
Miss Ramey said the objects, which appeared about 10 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 5, looked like silver stars and "could keep her inside most of the night for they kept appearing and disappearing."
Miss Effingham, who said she watches for any unusual objects in the sky, said the objects stayed silvery in color and in formations of about three times. She said they would disappear from sight and then reappear. The children here saw them too, she said.
The home's board of directors said Miss Effingham and Miss Ramey saw "what appeared to be several 'shooting stars' during their sighting from the Ramey Home."
Is beautiful, you know? The moon was full and there was practically no wind, she said. The three hours Sunday night were spent watching for the objects. They seemed to come from the southeast, stay awhile and then leave by going in a southwest direction, she said.
There may be some explanation, but it still remains a mystery about what the objects were and why they were there, she said.
