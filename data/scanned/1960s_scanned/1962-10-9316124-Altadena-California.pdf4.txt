The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text from the document:

It will be remembered that the Sheriff's Building is situated right at the foothills of the sharply rising mountain. The village of La Crescenta-Montrose on the south end of La Crescenta are in the neighborhood of 2500 feet in elevation, so the object can be explained by the updrafts currents of air being pushed aloft which offered no obscuring effect of the background.

It is the opinion of the investigating officer that, based on the strengths of the facts herein submitted, the unidentified object in this case was a weather balloon.
