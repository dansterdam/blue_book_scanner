The image appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The page contains two illustrations.

The first illustration is a compass-like diagram with directional labels. The text below the diagram states: "HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE - PLACE A DOT AT THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 2 ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH IT APPEARED TO GO."

The second illustration is a pair of sketches depicting a person standing in the foreground of a landscape, with a larger sketch of the same landscape in the background.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now extract all the text found in the document:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE - PLACE A DOT AT THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 2 ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH IT APPEARED TO GO.
