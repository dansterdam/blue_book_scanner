Dear Sir,

I would like to report a U. F. O. sighting... 
I was outside in the night of June 23, 1963. We were looking at the stars, though my telescope had been repaired. A sheppard egg shaped object was at treetop level, hovering. White in color, it seemed to glow from within. As it started again, it turned again to the north heading.

Yours sincerely,
