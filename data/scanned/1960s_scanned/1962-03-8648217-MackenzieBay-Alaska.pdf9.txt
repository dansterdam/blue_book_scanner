BIG SAUCER "FLAP" IN SOUTH AMERICA: A sensational series of saucer sightings has been taking place in South America. According to the report, this "flap" has apparently been going on more or less continuously since 1957. The flap has been centered primarily in Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile, and a great number of sightings have been made, many of them by responsible witnesses such as military and civil air crews, police, and others. The sightings have been going on so long (since 1957) and are so numerous and well-witnessed that the "flap" has become almost a routine occurrence in that part of the world. The objects seen are described as large, metallic, disk-shaped craft, some of which have been observed at close range (1,000 yards or less) and better than those in the U.S. sightings during 1957-1958. The objects are reported to maneuver in the air in a manner far beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. The report states that the "flap" has never been satisfactorily explained by the U.S. Air Force and that the objects have been under continuous observation by both civilian and military observers in the countries involved, but it is too poor in photographic quality to reproduce here. With the exception of a few sketches, no photographs of the objects in this "flap" are available.
