Coming from the north western "tripod" depression were appeared to be footprints. There were forty-three of these, having in a westerly direction, in what appeared to be a "tripod" impression. Some of the returning footprints leading in the opposite direction were twenty-two inches long and eight inches wide, and approximately two inches deep.

Radiation tests and photographs were taken of the area and included in this report.

At 1800 on 21 August 1964, an extensive search of the area concerned was made. With the exception of the impressions noted in this report, no further evidence of unusual activity was discovered. Due to the presence of numerous signs and articles of the two horses pastured in the area, the impressions were deemed indistinguishable from the time the investigating officer had arrived on the scene.

The exact location of the reported activity is 47 07N, 119 10W. This places the area in question within walking distance of the Installation's limits.

Results of this investigation would indicate that persons unknown entered the area and departed without leaving any trace which would provide evidence as to the identity of the individuals responsible. The "tripod" effect can be duplicated by rotating in a manner similar to that of the shoes involved in this action. The "crater" depression can be duplicated by rotating and identicial depressions were achieved. The alarm systems customarily employed to detect any unauthorized or unusual activity existing at the installation were in operation during the period in question and indicated no evidence of intrusion. Based on the investigation conducted, it is the opinion of the undersigned that nothing of significance to the Air Force or any other agency occurred at this installation on 21 August 1964.
