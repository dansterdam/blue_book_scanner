REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDSA(UFO)

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Overton, Nevada

TO: Hq USAF SAFOI-CC (Mrs Hunt)

Reference is made to the attached letter from Mrs informing on her unidentified observation. The following is a summary reply:

Your very vivid description and realistic drawing presented, indicates an apparent sighting of an upper air research balloon as it bursts. Balloons of this nature are launched by the U.S. Navy and Army Chemical Corps, generally programmed to fly between 80,000 feet and 125,000 feet. They can be destroyed at predetermined times by detonators attached to the balloon.

Over the past, observations of this nature have assisted in a better understanding of the instrument packages associated with these projects.

We wish to thank you for presenting this observation to the Air Force.

FOR THE COMMANDER

ERIC T. de JONCKHEERE, Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Technology and Subsystems
