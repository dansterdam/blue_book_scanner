14° 8 - 1 August: Surface 1930 C.; wind 280° at 10 kts; 12,000' - 5,000' at 0° C.; wind 120° at 5 kts; 10,000'- 64.5 C., wind 340° at 30 kts.
15 August: Surface 25.0° C., wind 120° at 3 kts; 17,000' - 4.0° C., wind 120° at 5 kts; 20,000' - (-15.0° C.), wind 120° at 10 kts; 24,000' - (-44.5° C.), wind 340° at 15 kts; 30,000' - (-64.5° C.), wind 340° at 30 kts.
16 August: Surface 25.0° C., wind calm; 10,000' + (16° C.), 355° at 5 kts; 20,000' - (-15.0° C.), wind 320° at 15 kts; 30,000' - (-67.5° C.), wind 320° at 35 kts.

1. 17 August: Surface 11.5° C., wind 090° at 8 kts; 6,000' + 21° C., wind 210° at 8 kts; 16,000' - 12° C., wind 190° at 10 kts; 20,000' - (-14° C.), wind 210° at 15 kts; 30,000' - (-42° C.), wind 280° at 30 kts.

The 1200Z sounding on 1 August revealed primary temperature inversions at the surface 2° to 12,000 feet, and a smaller inversion of 4° from 12,000' to 13,000 feet. A similar inversion occurred on 2 August from 12,000' - 13,000 feet. The 1200Z sounding on 3 August revealed a primary inversion extended from 1,800' to 13,000 feet.

Definite correlation with a reported two sightings was possible in only one case, no correlation with aircraft movements.

General Comments:
1. Due to the great number of sightings, specific reports on each sightings are not being forwarded, however all reports will be kept for reference.
2. In several instances, sightings were verified by other observers and aircraft control centers. Maneuvers observed are consistent with reported sightings.
3. Due to length of duty tours and distances involved, many reports were obtained by telephone and some what sketchy. Personal interviews with returning crews revealed more accurate information which sketched out additional descriptors and general characteristics.
4. There were reports of falling stars, however the men seemed to attribute these to the difference between star and aircraft sightings which are generally isolated in limited areas with unhindered vision in all directions. The combat defense personnel are accustomed to identify what would seem unusual objects and in some cases it is possible that these unusual objects would have been present.
