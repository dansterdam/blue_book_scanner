The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and some text. The diagram appears to be related to a UFO sighting, showing the path and direction of an object. There is also a compass-like image in the top right corner of the document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "O" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object.

28. Draw a straight line from the first position of the object to the last position of the object. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and place a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
