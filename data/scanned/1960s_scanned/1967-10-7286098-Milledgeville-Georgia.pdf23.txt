Dear Major:

I am listing the information on sightings by this department:

19th October 1967 3 AM Patrol Car Crew (4 men) observed an object at an altitude of about 1500 ft. that changed color from bright white to dark blue or black and then back to bright white. After about 10 minutes it sped away.

22nd October 1967 5:30 AM Tourist passing through Milledgeville stopped at this department and reported seeing an object hovering over the water of Lake Sinclair. He stated it looked like a "ball of fire" and no sound was heard, and the patrol car at about 300 yds would speed up with the object as it started to move away. The object then took off straight up and disappeared.

23rd October 1967 Between 4 and 6 AM. Object reported by 2 Milledgeville residents, one a college student, observed an object that changed colors from bright white to orange to red. It would not get close to the ground and could not keep up with the speed of the object.
