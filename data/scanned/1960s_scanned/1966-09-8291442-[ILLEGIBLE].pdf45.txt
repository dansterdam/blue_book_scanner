COMMANDER

Wright-Patterson AFB
Dear Sir:

The purpose of this communication is to informally confirm an alleged sighting of a fly object. Actually, however, upon checking, there is no record of this incident according to local radio broadcasts. Many other activities in this area around the same time do not give it much thought.

Based on the nature of what was observed, and the fact that it does not seem to conform to any known aircraft formation, I am inclined to believe this was a "valid" sighting, and I actually have never observed such before.

I am located in the small town of Talmage, California (CROP # 670) which is about 5 miles east of Ukiah, California. It was the time of twilight, a clear evening, and I was looking into the southern sky. I suddenly observed an object, about the size of a medium aircraft (approx. 60 ft. in diameter), moving at a fairly high rate of speed...
