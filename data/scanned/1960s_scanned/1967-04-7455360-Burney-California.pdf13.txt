Dear Mr. Wint,

Your letter of April 9th, which contained information concerning the alleged UFO sighting in the Burney, California area on the evening of April 7th, has been received and carefully reviewed. This office has a long-standing policy of thoroughly investigating all bona fide reports of unidentified aerial phenomena which are submitted to it. However, in the present case, the information provided is quite sketchy and incomplete. No details are given as to the specific nature of the sighting, the number and appearance of the objects observed, their apparent size, altitude, direction of flight, duration of observation, or the identity and background of the observer(s). Without these essential details, it is impossible for us to conduct a meaningful investigation or to make any definitive assessment of the situation. 

I would be most grateful if you could provide me with a more comprehensive and detailed report of this incident at your earliest convenience. Any drawings, photographs, or other physical evidence that may be available would also be extremely helpful. Upon receipt of such additional information, I will be glad to initiate a thorough inquiry into this matter.

Sincerely,

[Signature redacted]
