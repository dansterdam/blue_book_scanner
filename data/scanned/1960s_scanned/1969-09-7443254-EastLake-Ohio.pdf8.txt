D. IF SIGHTING WAS BY DAYLIGHT, WAS THE SUN VISIBLE? [-] YES [x] NO. IF "YES" - WHERE WAS THE SUN AS YOU FACED DIRECTION OF SIGHTING?
IF NIGHT, CHECK NATURE OF ILLUMINATION (I.E., STREET LAMPS, ETC.): FOR TERRESTRIAL ILLUMINATION, SPECIFY DISTANCE TO LIGHT SOURCE.

Additional handwritten notes:
I made a record of lights seen at time a small cigar shaped object passed overhead making a slight high-pitched whirring sound for approximately 20 seconds. The object was low and moving at a moderate speed. It could be clearly seen and was about 30-40 feet long. It appeared dark colored and smooth on the surface.
