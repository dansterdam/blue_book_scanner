There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

NON-FACTUAL IMPRESSIONS:
(1) The objects appeared to be higher than about 500 feet.
(2) If it was assumed that their speed was that of a conventional airplane, 400-500 mph, it would seem to indicate an extremely high angular velocity - my best guess would be 10 degrees per second.
(3) The time from first sighting to the time when they passed overhead was approximately 2 to 3 minutes.
(4) The time from passing overhead was approximately 1 to 2 minutes.
(5) The airport tower controller in Huntsville the next morning told me that there was only one small aircraft in the sky, and that it was south of there.
(6) I initially do not believe it was a conventional airplane.
(7) I leave open only the obscure possibility of balloons; however, I initially do not believe it was balloons because of the rapid motion of the center object and the cancellation of light when the two objects crossed.
(8) If they were balloons at an altitude of 500 feet, and if assuming their speed of balloons would be 25 mph, Recalling balloons and farther away they would seem unrealistically small for such clear weather conditions. If they were balloons and farther away, they would have been very large.
(9) I do not believe the objects were reflection, since I saw them clearly with my head outside of the window. Also, since there were no clouds, I do not believe it was a reflection of a light on a cloud.
(10) I am considerably (but not dogmatically) sure of what it was not. The objects were clearly seen by my wife, all of my three children, and myself. The above observations, as stated, are true and continue our conviction that an unusual object or objects of some kind were observed.
