13 July 65
Phil Donahue called from WHIO, Dayton, Ohio. Wanted information from Maj Quintanilla on sightings on night of 12 July 65. Informed him that it was high atmosphere balloon. Asked how do we substantiate the fact that it was a high atmosphere balloon. (1) PIOÃ‡'s over Pennsylvania identified it as such. (2) Sulpher Grove Balloon launch personnel saw object at 8:20pm and identified it as upper air research balloon.
Phil Donahue wanted to come out here and take a 45 second film tape for television news on this subject. Major Quintanilla explained that this was not possible as permission had to be granted by the Secretary of the Air Force Office of Information in Washington, D C and this would take several days.

WGIC Radio from Xenia, Ohio called. Wanted information from Maj Quintanilla on sightings on night of 12 July 1965. Informed him that it was high atmosphere balloon and that we were still checking to see who launched. Sulpher Grove identified it was a balloon with instrument package.

Mr Al Morris at NCAR, Boulder, Colorado. No did they did not have any launched in that time. Could have been one of theirs. Last one was two months ago and was 18ft in diameter, traveling from East to West. There was one over the Azores on 9 Jul. We told him air weather service saw it from the ground.
Morris said that if they had seen it from a plane it would be about 40,000 ft it could have been theirs cause a balloon might have endured a second trip around.

Told him it was a high altitude balloon, in accordance with AFS 200-2 he will send complete report paying particular attention to comments of personnel operating officers. His extension is 633.
