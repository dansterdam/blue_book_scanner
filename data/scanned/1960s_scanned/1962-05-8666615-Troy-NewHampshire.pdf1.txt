PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 5 May 1962
2. LOCATION: Troy, New Hampshire
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2013
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual
5. DURATION OF OBSERVATION: Approx 5 mins
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
7. COURSE: Unknown
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Several witnesses observed a bright object moving up and down and also sidewise. It was sighted for several minutes and then disappeared. The object was not pulsating but seemed to change in brightness. Its color was described as very bright, possibly like Venus and contrary to the movement and change, probably the brightest planet. This planet may have been visible and misinterpreted in this sighting.

11. COMMENTS: The information contained in this report from the description of the object does not lead to a conclusion that the sighting was of an unidentified flying object. It appears more likely that the witnesses observed a bright planet, possibly Venus, under atmospheric conditions which gave the appearance of unusual motion and changes in brightness.
