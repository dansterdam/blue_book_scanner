11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer watched a triangular shaped object larger than an airplane at 1 mile, travel and appear to land in the south. Three objects were seen according to the observers, which emitted a very bright light. The object appeared to land south of the observers position. The most probable cause of the sighting is a KC-135 aircraft which was in the area making simulated instrument approach landings. Observations of both B-52 and KC-135 aircraft during approach and landing have caused many UFO sightings around the Blytheville AFB area.
