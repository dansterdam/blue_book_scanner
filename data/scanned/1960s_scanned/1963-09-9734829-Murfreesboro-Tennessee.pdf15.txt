A large meteorite which flashed across the skies of Southern Colorado into daylight Sun on September 3rd was the object of an intense search by scientists, who were hopeful of finding in it fossils that would prove the existence of life on other worlds. Previous claims of fossil finds in meteorites have been doubted or discounted because the meteorites were found long after impact, allowing time for earthly contamination to continue the deception. This one, seen by hundreds of people before it crashed in rugged mountain country, had not been disturbed at last report.
