The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads as follows:

UFO Sighting, Wantagh, New York, May 61
HQ USAF SAFOI PR (Mrs Hunt)
Hq. USAF DC DE 253539 

1. We have received a report of an unidentified flying object from Wantagh, New York dated 6 Nov 61. 

2. The sighting of May 61 to which they refer is too old to warrant an investigation. In all probability the object was an aircraft of some sort. It is suggested that a Fact Sheet be included with the Air Force's reply.
