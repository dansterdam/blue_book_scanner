Dear Ray:

The following report concerns the sighting of September 3, 1966, by Mr. and Mrs. E. MacGillvary, 30 Island Park Road, Wenham, Massachusetts. The witnesses appeared to be serious and cooperative according to the attached forms. The witnesses mentioned that they had not been able to see things of this nature before and that they were completely taken by surprise by the occurrence.

The following is a general summary of the information as I pieced it together from the report forms. Also enclosed is a copy of the sketch made of the object as it was seen.

On September 17, Saturday evening at approximately 8:15 P.M., the witnesses saw in the western sky a bright light which is described as having a rotating effect. It was at an estimated altitude of 1,000 to 3,000 feet and in a northwesterly direction. It hovered for about half an hour, i.e., the activity both from inside the house and from outside the house. The object first sighted was an elongated cigar shape, sometimes dim and then bright enough to see that it was a long shape and apparently had a fog-like effect extending for a distance. It appeared to be several hundred feet long by about a 50 foot wide. As it became light outside, the object appeared to be a dotted line effect extending from the ground at a 45 degree angle. This object was observed for a period of over an hour.
