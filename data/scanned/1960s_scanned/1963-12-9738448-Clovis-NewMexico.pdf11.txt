Foam
(Continued from Page 1)
The foam was destroyed by frightened children and adults who spread some of it over their bodies and heads, mistaking it for a substance that might be dangerous or injurious to the skin. This is reminiscent of an incident at the farm in Orleans, Illinois during the fall of 1958 when a similar substance fell from the sky and was similarly treated.
When the foam was examined again there was no evidence of any distinguishing characteristics. The foam had completely disintegrated.
Examination of the samples indicates that the substance may have been caused by the emergency ejection of a substance similar to the foam used to extinguish airplane fires. It is identical in appearance to that type of foam. We conclude, this substance seems to be some form of aircraft emergency foam, perhaps from a small military craft in the area, although there is no confirmation of any such incident or craft in the area at the time. We would appreciate it if our readers could provide any information they may have regarding this incident.
