FLIGHT PATH THAT WAS ALMOST DIRECTLY OVER US, AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD THE LIGHTS DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW EXCEPT FOR AN ERRATIC SPARKLING ON THE LEADING EDGE. THE OBJECT MOVED AWAY AT A CONSTANT SPEED ON THE SAME COURSE OF APPROXIMATELY 360 DEGREES. AS IT MOVED AWAY A SINGLE PULSATING LIGHT BECAME VISIBLE. THIS LIGHT WAS A BIT MORE INTENSE THAN THE LIGHTS SEEN FROM THE FRONT VIEW, AND IT PULSED SOMEWHAT SLOWER, AS THOUGH FROM DOPPLER EFFECT.

AT NO TIME WAS THERE ANY SOUND, NOT EVEN THE SOUND A GLIDING OB-JECT WOULD MAKE NORMALLY. THE ONLY AUDIBLE SOUND IN THE AREA AT THE TIME WAS A DISTANT RADIO PLAYING.

JUDGING FROM THE LOW APPROACH ANGLE (APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON WHEN FIRST SEEN) AND THE LOW DEPARTURE ANGLE (LESS THAN 20 DEGREES WHEN ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY), I WOULD ESTIMATE THE OBJECT WAS BELOW 1000 FEET ALTITUDE. BASED ON THIS ALTITUDE, I WOULD ESTIMATE THE OBJECT'S SPEED AT 30 TO 60 KNOTS.

AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, THERE WAS A C-124 AIRCRAFT BEING LOADED OR UNLOADED ON THE COMPASS ROSE A FEW HUNDRED YARDS SOUTH OF OUR POSITION. THERE WERE AIR POLICE GUARDS AND TRUCKS AROUND THE AIRCRAFT.
