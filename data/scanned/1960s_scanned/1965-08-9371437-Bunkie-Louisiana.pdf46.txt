Transcription of the handwritten text:

"Tellinogut and some of the population are convinced that a saucer landed at the town cemetery recently. The mayor has interviewed a number of the witnesses and according to his statements the object was elliptical in shape, about 50 feet in diameter, and hovered over the cemetery for several minutes. It then took off straight up at a terrific speed. The witnesses stated that the object was silent during the landing and take-off.  

Many of the inhabitants of Tellinogut are disturbed because of this incident, and some of them are even considering moving away from the area, fearing that the object might return. The mayor has contacted the nearest Air Force base to report the incident, but so far no official investigation has been made.

It is further reported that in the nearby town of St. Joseph, a similar object was sighted several weeks ago, also hovering over the local cemetery. The description of the object was almost identical to the one reported from Tellinogut.  

If other reports of this nature are received, it is recommended that a thorough and prompt investigation be made, in order to determine the true nature of these sightings."
