SUBJECT: UFO OBSERVATIONS

On the afternoon of 11 October 1968 at 11:15 Carmen Marino accepted a collect telephone call from phone number 782-8966 (Boone-Salem??).

The person was not speaking distinctly; several times It Marino asked the person's name. The person was so indistinct that the name sounded like either a or a. The person sounded like either a male or a woman with a slightly deeper voice.

The person said they wanted to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object. The person said they wrote a letter a couple of days ago about sightings over Boone, North Carolina. The sightings have been occurring for the past three months. We see them almost every clear night. The Air Force won't investigate them because they say they don't have the manpower.

The objects are usually going east and are visible for about fifteen minutes. The person was quite concerned that the Air Force wouldn't do something about it. It Marino said we would investigate the sighting and where he was calling from so that we could investigate his sighting.

However, the person just mumbled and rattled on and did not give the stated information. The person just kept saying, "Well, I have to go now." I have to go now.

There was considerable noise in the background.

The person was calling from a pay telephone. The noise was similar to that of what you would find in a school. The person said they had to go and hung up.
