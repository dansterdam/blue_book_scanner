The image appears to contain a photograph. The photograph shows a radar track or trace, which is a line or shape that represents the movement or detection of an object on a radar system.

6. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL do not normally take note of every sighting of unidentified flying objects as such, unless a request is made for further investigation of a reported sighting. This is due to the fact that many reports appear to be natural phenomena or other objects which do not warrant further investigation at that time, or which have already been satisfactorily explained. Consequently, the maintenance of observation of unidentified aircraft or other objects which remain in a radar picture is usually not justified except when specifically requested from higher headquarters.
