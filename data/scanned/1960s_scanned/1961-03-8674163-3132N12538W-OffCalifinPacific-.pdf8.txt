Dear Mr. X,

I have passed the information you forwarded in yours of August 29th to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center (Blue Ridge Military Division).

The March 29th sighting you refer to was probably a Thor Intercontinental Ballistic Missile which was launched at Cape Canaveral on that date. As you know, the Thor is the booster for the Agena vehicle. The discovery is in the Air Force program as an IRBM, now deployed in England and manned by the RAF.

I hope this clarifies the situation.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
