A number of County Park employees studying from Gold and his son observed an object over the park's main office at about 4 p.m. when it "circled past" in an east-west direction. It then seemed to halt in its course and make a tight turn and proceed in a northwest direction. The object was stated to be in sight about 5 minutes. The clouds could not, his son observed, account for this phenomenon. Gold said the object appeared to be an unusual weather balloon which ordinarily floats in one direction.
