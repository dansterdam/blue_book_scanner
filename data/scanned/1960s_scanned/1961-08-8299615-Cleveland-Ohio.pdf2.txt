SUBJECT: Report of UFO Sighting
TO: TU-E (Maj Friend)
1. At 17:30 on 8 August 1961, the Observer of the Cleveland Plain Dealer called to report a sighting of UFO's. Most of these reports occurred between 1600 to 1830 hours.
2. Dr. _, of the SOCIO Research Laboratory Tracking Station, advised me that they have the means for monitoring and correlating these sightings. Lt. _ was the officer in charge and has the responsibility for tracking the various sightings. Dr. _ therefore, has the most qualified persons to speak for these observations.
3. The altitude of the UFO's had not been determined at the time of the sighting, but Dr. _ thought, and from information consisting of three scopes to compute the altitude, Dr. _ and additional instruments at his station.
4. At 1645 two F-86 or F-102 aircraft were observed flying in the area of sightings and they were estimated to be at approximately 25,000 feet. The observer stated that they were flying from East to West. One of the aircraft made a port climb which apparently was done to investigate the UFO's. Perhaps these pilots could assist in the investigation.
5. Summary of reports submitted by Dr. _ are as follows:
a. The UFO's traveled two to three times the velocity of Echo I.
b. They were visible within 5Â° of the sun. (Dir. _ stated he thought that their visibility was due to the refraction of the sun's rays by the corona of the building.)
c. The UFO's traveled from Northeast to Southeast and in a straight line through the corona of the sun.
d. The UFO's were 1/2 to 1/3 the brightness of Echo I and they were much brighter than the brightest star (Magnitude 1).
