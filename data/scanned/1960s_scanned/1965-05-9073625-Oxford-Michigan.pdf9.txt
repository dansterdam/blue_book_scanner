OXFORD, MICHIGAN
7 MAY 1965

At approximately 1930 to 1940 on 7 May 1965, three observers noticed a shiny object in the sky. They obtained 6 x 30 binoculars and decided that it must be a Sputnik type vehicle moving at a high velocity. The object was high and looked to be larger than a star. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes and then suddenly disappeared. Shortly thereafter, the bright shiny object gave off three other shiny but smaller objects.

A fourth shiny object was observed further out into space and further away from the original object. This fourth object gradually grew smaller and then the other three struck out and gradually faded. The red lighted object looked like it was standing still. The object was observed for approximately 5-10 minutes.

The observer removed the glasses from his eyes to tell son to go after the objects as they disappear. Observers could not find the objects again but observed a steady cloud cover that had not been there before.

The objects were visible for approximately one minute. After the objects disappeared a steady cloud cover came from the NW and covered the observation area.

COMMENTS
The observer thought he had seen multiple-spring released satellites from a rocket, however, neither the Vandenberg nor Kennedy launch half-stage separations over the United States are substantiated. Furthermore, the observer stated that the objects were not typical of usual aircraft or vehicles. The description of the object does not fit any known aircraft or satellite. A definite explanation is not possible. This case is carried as unidentified by the Air Force.
