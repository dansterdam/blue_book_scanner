Dear Mrs. *******,

This will reply to your recent letter in which you reported seeing an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will coordinate this sighting with the appropriate personnel at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, they will be able to investigate the matter further.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. This base has a UFO investigation which is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
