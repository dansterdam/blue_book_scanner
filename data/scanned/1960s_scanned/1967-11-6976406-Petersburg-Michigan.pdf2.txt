These were bodies in the sky that illuminated at night, they were bodies like clouds but smaller in size and much brighter than clouds. They seemed to have a soft yellow glow and were quite distinct from the moon and stars. They seemed to float slowly at times, move quickly at times and at one point one body approached very close, to within what seemed like 200 yards and was quite bright and clear.
