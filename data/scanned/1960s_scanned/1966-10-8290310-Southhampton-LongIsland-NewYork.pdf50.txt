'I Photographed a UFO'
Space Spectacle 
Over L.I.
By LEONARD VICTOR
I saw and photographed a 1970 — an unidentified flying object — in South Brettenham late Saturday night, and although I did not see them, the film clearly showed three extra objects besides the UFO I was pictured.
At the same time I was actually and steadily operating my AltaVista, the Air Force told The Press about the same object sighting. When Victor photographed the UFO in flight, right, he didn't realize there were three more in formation, as left. He turned up when he developed the film.
