Constanoe, Idid not see any "vehicle", but a riglhts in the sky that moved erratlo ally anl at a hih speed. They appeared to be several lights moving together irregularly. I was alarmed by this 8 ight and called my husband to atclh them. He also observed the same phenomenon. We were both somewhat disturbed by what we saw, as it did not appear to be anything we were familiar with. The lights moved without any sound and did not conform to any known aircraft. This incident occurred around 7t3o P.M. on March 4, 1969 in Fall River, Massachusetts.
