AN ENCOUNTER

Send it with skill, so I bought a dog whistle too to disturb human ears and tried to learn the Ñ. I was hearing what sounded like a tele-death business from other direction and a closely woodpecker would change from his ordinary to vary definite dot-dashes. I bought a tape recorder and tried to start taping the same that when I learned the Morse Code I could interprit it. Unfortunately, I was able to get only a few tapes unbroken, discovered my recorder and received blocks from my magnetic tape. Two or three times I tried on the same blank tape and got perfect reproduction, so Ī thought the tapes were not permanent a long time I thought they had special devices where for sound (and I still think this) but I also discovered can manipulate energy which is already there. I the do-tee-dashes were in all my experience, ditcheator, drier, as well as the heating too-kettle, Ị sink drain, typewriter keys and in my own pulse as I got it as deep I simply do not know. At any rate, to start the Morse Code and found I did best of Spanish Castanets than the dog-whistle. Sense of the message sent and received later, but that my hearing became very acute just when I thought a hearing aid and my children were fussing about the girl with sound they could tune initative motorycle or end played an extensive game with the local police busy chasing "speeders" around the village in July, the police got some innocent people in their pursuit sounds. At first I thought it amusing, but I know it is annoying, but I thought it amusing, but I know it is annoying.
