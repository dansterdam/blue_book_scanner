SUBJECT: Observation of Unidentified Aerological Phenomena

1. At time 0430 39m (0939 GMT) 13 September 1961, in the vicinity of latitude 39o24'N, longitude 71o20'W, (operation by JORNADA), a small elongated orange colored light, extending east to west was observed. This light was flashing, intermittently, approximately 1 to 2 times per second. This light appeared, closely resembling a miniature moon. This light became brighter and then dimmed, until it reached a maximum brightness, and then it began to dim again. This took approximately 5 seconds. At this time the crescent moon was observed, which was approximately 1/3 full. This took approximately 5 seconds at which time it quickly faded and disappeared. A slight increase of barometric pressure was observed.

2. Cloud coverage: 2/10 cumulus with slight traces of alto cumulus. Atmospheric pressure: 29.10 inches (sea level) Aneroid. Wind force 3 its from 280o True.

3. This phenomena was observed in its entirety by myself and the Junior Officer of the Deck, LT US A. M. ARDOIN, USNR.

Very respectfully,
