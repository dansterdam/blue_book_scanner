Dear Sir,

Because of the incident which occurred on February 15, 1960, I am enclosing a copy of a letter which I have written to the Officer in Charge, and a copy of a signed statement which I have made. I am the Rockledge resident whose car was affected by the brilliance of the light that shone on and around the car.

I can verify that what was seen and the behavior of the objects encountered were unusual to say the least. When they were in motion and sharply emerged from behind the trees, they could maintain that position for some time, as though suspended, and then rapidly dart away in a zig-zag manner, and then they could hold that position again as though in defiance of gravity. The brilliance of the light was so intense that it literally illuminated the entire countryside at a distance of approximately 1/2 a mile.

I am a rather stable person and trust my observations are as accurate and factual as can be determined at this time. I do not know of any more and no noticeable conclusions except that the altitude, speed and maneuvers of this object were unexplainable to me and, for that matter, to the four witnesses who were with me in the car at the time.

Feb. 18, 1960
