1. Reference attached copy of a letter to Department of the Air Force dated 17 October 1960.

The weather data reveals that there were temperature inversion conditions throughout the general area during the period of the sightings, while the inversion is highly probable that the UFO seen by the witness is described as was this planet.

2. The ATIC files do not contain any reports of sightings occurring on 11 August 1960 so I will be referring to material I have on hand.
