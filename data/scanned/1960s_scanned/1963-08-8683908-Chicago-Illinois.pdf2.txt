Northbrook Aviator Explains
Those 'Mysterious' Lights

"Strange lights" reportedly seen over the Northbrook Aviation Company's airfield were explained by an employee of the company.

Mr. Burmeister, an employee of the Northbrook Aviation Company, reported that he has observed several "strange lights" over the airfield on eight different nights.

"Unless the viewer is directly in front of the lights, they appear to be hovering in the distance. But when the viewer gets in front of them, they seem to be receding across the sky," Mr. Burmeister said.

Mr. Burmeister's explanation is that the lights are the landing lights of aircraft coming in to land at the Northbrook airfield. He says that from certain angles, the landing lights can give the impression of hovering or stationary lights in the sky.
