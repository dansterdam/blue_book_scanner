Reference your May 1967 observation of an unidentified flying object. Reply to your request for clarification on your sighting:

The sighting occurred on the night of 14 May 1967, however, the conditions you considered indicated this was not a conventional aircraft. Based on the information you provided, the lighting conditions and the maneuvering you observed would approximate a note from you clarifying this discrepancy.
