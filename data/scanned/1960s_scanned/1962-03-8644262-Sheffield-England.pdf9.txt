b. In reading the reported situation during which the photographic evidence was taken, we find that:
(1) We do not wish to question the integrity of the boy who submitted the report. However, the Air Ministry would hold a youth or 14 for questioning, if they considered that the information would more likely be taken.
(2) The statement by Mr. A. H. H. was no fault as to the cause or the printed images.
(3) No photographic expert would offer an explanation for this print as the Air Ministry nor any photographer experts would offer no explanation for this chance.
(4) Photographic experts viewed the negatives and could find no signs of distortion. However, they offer no explanation with the negatives. They maintain that there is no fault or tampering with the negatives.
(5) While the photographic experts maintain that there would be no full explanation offered, of course their statements are being noted and without doubt, the possibly/probably would indicate any such further or contact, with the complete situation and existing only the possibility/probable was indicated.
6. We appreciate your opinions and your interest in the United States Air Force position regarding unidentified flying objects. At this time, we are returning your photograph and three duplicate copies.
