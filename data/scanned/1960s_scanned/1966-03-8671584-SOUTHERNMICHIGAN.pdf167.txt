signed officers returned to the Road address, where they were talked to.

TALK WITH stated that he had observed the lights coming from the swamp, and had awakened his son then proceeded into the swamp in an attempt to find out the object which was producing the light. Upon entering the lower edge of the swamp, he stated "what is that thing", and as he looked in the direction indicated, the object was observed. At the instant of observation the small lights went out, and in just an instant, re-appeared across the swamp, a distance of about 500 yards. At this time, the object became illuminated from a brilliant source of light, which flowed horizontally between two small lights. After watching for a couple of minutes, the rays of light from two flashlights were observed from the ridge above the object. The light from the object intensified, then went out, and a whistle similar to the sound of a rifle bullet ricochet was heard, and the object passed directly over in just an instant.
