CLOSE SIGHTING IN PENNSYLVANIA: On the evening of November 27th, two men-resdients of Confluence, Pennsylvania, saw a luminous cigar-shaped craft pass over the city. It seemed to be about ten feet in diameter, and no higher than 2 thousand feet. It more ascending and descending, and its movement was very erratic. It came to a complete stop at one point, and then disappeared "in no time at all," according to the report. (Saucer News, 11/29/65)

ARGENTINE PLANE NEARLY CRASHES WITH A UFO: Still another case of UFOs endangering the exclusively-identified flights of American airlines occurred on the 24th of November, when an Argentine airliner, carrying passengers, was bound for a landing at Resistencia, an route from Rio de Janeiro, at about 9:30 P.M. local time. While descending for landing, the crew of the airliner suddenly observed a brilliant, fast-moving object headed directly toward them. The pilot made a "rapid maneuver" to change course while the mysterious object passed them. The passengers also observed the same UFO, and it was observed visually by personnel at the airport's control tower.
