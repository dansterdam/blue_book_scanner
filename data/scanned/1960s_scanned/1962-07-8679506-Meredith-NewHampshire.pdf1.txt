The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a Project 10073 Record Card. The card contains various fields with information about an observation, including the location (Meredith, New Hampshire), the date (5 July 1962), the duration of the observation (30 seconds), and a description of the observed object, which is described as looking like an "a/c" (aircraft) but had a "fin" and seemed to be an "a/c" but was "backing away". The card also includes several checkboxes for conclusions and other details about the observation.
