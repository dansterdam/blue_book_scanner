FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

HQ. AAC. 19 February 1960---Reports made public by the Alaskan Air Command indicates the unidentified flying object sighted in the skies in northwestern Alaska last Sunday was an extremely high powered white hot source at very high elevation. It is believed this object was traveling at a much higher speed than any known satellite and due to the tremendous speed, missiles and rockets have been ruled out. These conclusions were forwarded to Headquarters, United States Air Force, by Alaskan Air Command.

Dr. Christian T. Elvey, Director, Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska, and a member of the United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, concurred in the findings. These conclusions are based on eye witness sightings at Nome, St. Micheal, Unalakleet, and Holliachuk and systems of triangulation. The meteor was sighted over an area of approximately 180 nautical miles, traveling in a relatively straight line Northwest to Southeast. Sightings were mostly of five to ten seconds duration indicating tremendous speed at a very high altitude in conjunction with the angle and azimuth of observation and disappearance.
