Le Marano:
The Navy did not have any balloon launches that might have been responsible for our sighting. They did have a launch 8 Nov from Minneapolis, however, it was terminated the next day and they had a confirmation on it on 9 Nov that it came down. Mr. Demboski was sorry that he couldn't be of further assistance.
