Content of the document:

My parents visited a UFO last night Messrs a 12 by 35 foot landed on Gardiners Island. The center was a brilliant blue, large beam of light in the center. A brilliant blue-white flame shooting out from the center. The flames were about 15 feet long. The craft hovered for about 30 minutes.
Four people came out of the craft men and woman and one thing they did not seem human made observes about 200 yards from us. They did things I cannot explain. My parents tried to contact them but they did not give us a chance to come near. The craft took off straight up and disappeared into the night sky.
