11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer reported seeing a fireball like object going from east to west. Comments: There was a Titan 34-D Debree that was to decay 20 Nov 67 plus or minus 12 hours but it is not known if object was retrograde. This combined with the fact that duration of the sighting are not known, since the object may have been a fireball, precludes an evaluation of insufficient data.
