The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a text document with a title "REPORT OF SIGHTING OF FLYING SAUCER" and a written report describing an alleged sighting of a flying object by a young boy in Dalton, Kentucky in 1966.

The text of the document is as follows:

REPORT OF SIGHTING OF "FLYING SAUCER"

The witness, a 7-year old boy, but rather a ton year old boy, but rather intelligent, at Dalton, Route 2, Caldwell County, called at the office of Civil Defense, Caldwell County, as per request, accompanied by his mother, to make a personal report on the sighting of a somewhat airborne, in Caldwell County. On September 2, 1966, about 6 PM, while the boy was playing alone on a rural road, he heard a noise overhead which he described as something between the noise of a jet airplane and a buzz saw, circular in motion. 

He was unable to estimate the altitude of the object as it was difficult to the naked eye due to the setting sun lighting conditions. 

The object approached him, slowed down and hovered a few seconds, then started off in a direction ahead of him, at an angle. From the rear of the object he observed what appeared like contrails follow the glow in a furnace. The object disappeared rapidly from sight.

The boy stated he was scared to death, and his statement was quite hysterical when he arrived home later.

September 28, 1966
