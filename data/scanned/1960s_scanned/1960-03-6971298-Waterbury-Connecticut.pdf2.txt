Transcribing the text:

Dear Sir:
On March 3, 1960 at approximately 6:15 p.m. my family and I observed a strange object in the sky. The object appeared to be hovering or slowly moving in a northwesterly direction. It was a bright object and appeared to be larger than a star or planet. It was viewed for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing.
