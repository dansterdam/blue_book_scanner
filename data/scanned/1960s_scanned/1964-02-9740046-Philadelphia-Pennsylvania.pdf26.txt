Blounttown of the Air Observers By: Lt. Col. Gentlemen: Thank you for the information you have sent me. I appreciate your information more than you could know. If you get any more information, I would be very interested. About Project Bluebook, tell me something about it. Is it all a hoax. Can you confirm in 1952 than many more actual sightings were than reported. I know the Air Force is reluctant to admit that and do not want to say much on this subject.
