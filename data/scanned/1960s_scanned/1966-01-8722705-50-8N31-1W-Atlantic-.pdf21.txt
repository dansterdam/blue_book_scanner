The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

The object appeared to be a metal structure, a square or rectangular shape, that appeared to be at about 3,000 feet or so. The object was metallic in appearance, or appeared to glint as it passed by the aircraft, and was observed for approximately 5 minutes. There was no reported sonic boom or noise associated with the passage of the object. The object passed from west to east, and disappeared off the right side of the aircraft.
