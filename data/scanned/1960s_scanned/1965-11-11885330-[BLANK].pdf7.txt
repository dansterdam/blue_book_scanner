ACTION NO. 5: The Panel took note of and discussed the 1965 Annual Report, recommending that a concise flight summary be provided in which page numbers of the detailed individual summaries are given.

MR. LASLEY then distributed a statement concerning actions taken by NCAR on recommendations made by the Panel at earlier meetings (attached as Appendix C).

The Panel then observed that there will be a notable eclipse during 1966 and discussed the possibility for use of balloons, including tethered balloons, for an expedition during the eclipse.

ACTION NO. 6: It was moved and seconded that NCAR make informal inquiry as to progress of the tethered balloon project at NOPS with a possible view toward future cooperation. Motion carried unanimously.

ACTION NO. 7: It was moved and seconded that NCAR take note that a very suspicious total eclipse will occur in May 1966 in South America and the South Atlantic which will offer possibilities for good eclipse observations by balloonborne instruments. Motion carried unanimously.

Following the discussion of NCAR actions on previous Panel recommendations, the Panel returned to Agenda Item 1.

ACTION NO. 8: It was regularly moved and seconded that the minutes of the previous meeting be accepted as read. Motion passed unanimously.
