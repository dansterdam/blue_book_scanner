The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, with handwritten text at the top that says "15 Jun 67 / lot 1 (air express)".

Now, as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

15 Jun 67
lot 1 (air express)
