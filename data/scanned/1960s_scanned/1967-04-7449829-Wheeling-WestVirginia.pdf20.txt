The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains an illustration and instructions related to sketching the observed motion and location of a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the circle to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the circle to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, THEN HOW MANY WERE THERE?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
