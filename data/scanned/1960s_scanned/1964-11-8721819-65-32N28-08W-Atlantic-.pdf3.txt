The image contains a scanned document page from the Project Blue Book archive, but it does not contain any photographs. Instead, the page appears to be a text-based document with a table or array of numerical data.

Transcribing the text:

AP IN: 32684(13 NOV 64)
5. VISUAL
6. UNKNOWN 
7. UNABLE TO CORRELATE WITH RADAR
BT
NNN
NOTE: ADV CY DEL UFO PIA AND NIN

The text describes an unidentified visual sighting that was unable to be correlated with radar data. The numerical data in the table likely contains additional details about the sighting, but I am unable to interpret or provide any further analysis of that information.
