If the sound log in 13 inches ft. a distance of 24 inches; then the ratio timer 1/2 the speed of sound will give the real speed of the object. 60/24=2.5 which is 1750 ft/sec. Then 51.4 diameter per 57 seconds.

7.6 seconds have elapsed in 17 seconds; then 51.4/7.6=6.8 gives 6.8/7.6=0.89 which will give the real calculated diameter which is 51.4.

The object is traveling at 45 degree angle and at a speed of 24 inches, the object diameter is 51.4 inches and the time needed to travel an equal distance is determined as I have just calculated.

So the same amount of time is needed for the round to travel the distance. This is the time given for the round to travel the same distance which is 17,650 ft/sec. Which is the correct speed from the observers. Therefore, this is 17,650 ft/sec which is the true speed of the object.

By dividing by 1.4 (the can calculated sound is 1176) we have a true speed of the object of 12,628 ft.

As a result of these calculations, I have to mind that the object was at an estimated range of 250 miles/hr.
