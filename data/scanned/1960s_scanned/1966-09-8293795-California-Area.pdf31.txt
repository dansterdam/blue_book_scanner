The Informant, 6 September 1966
California area
He claimed to have observed a strange object in the sky at approximately 10:30 PM on 6 September 1966. He described the object as being similar in appearance to a full moon, but smaller and much brighter. The object was perfectly round, with no visible edges or surface markings. It appeared to be hovering or stationary in the sky. After several minutes of observation, the object began to move slowly in a westerly direction, maintaining its round shape and bright glow. After traveling a short distance, the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. The witness was unable to provide any additional details regarding the object or the incident.
