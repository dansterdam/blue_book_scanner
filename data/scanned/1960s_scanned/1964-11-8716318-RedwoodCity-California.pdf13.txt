There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten page from a document, likely related to a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Major valley, this is something very interesting. The whole object was small, two oblong things, one above the other were about the size of this (sketch). They were in the sky and at an angle like this (sketch). When looked at, they were of short duration, like those (sketch). That's about all I could see, as my attention was attracted to the object only momentarily. I did not make any notes nor any measurements, as I couldn't do so very well. Please let me know if you would like any more information about it.
