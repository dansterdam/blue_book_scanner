There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Dear Sirs:
I do not recall observing anything unusual or strange on the evening of May 31, 1962, as reported in the news media.
While it may have been unusual to some, what I observed was a normal and natural phenomenon which I have seen on many occasions. The bright light in the sky was not a strange or unnatural occurrence, but rather a normal astronomical event which is not uncommon.
I hope this clarifies the matter and provides the information you requested. Please let me know if you need any additional details.
Sincerely,

P.S. Would you please return the Kodak "Instamatic" camera that I loaned to you a few days ago as I need it again. "Act G like a book!"
