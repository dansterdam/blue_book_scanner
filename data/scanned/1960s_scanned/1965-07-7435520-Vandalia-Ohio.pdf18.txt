There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, containing a series of questions related to the sighting of a UFO.

11. Did the object disappear? If so, how?
12. Did the object appear to be larger or smaller or the same size as the full moon?
13. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
14. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color
18. We wish to know the approximate size and shape of the object. What was the length in inches, compared to the full moon. How much of the object is covered by the hand at arm's length, if you had to estimate the size of the object?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the objects that you saw, such as wings, protuberances, etc., and especially indicate by arrows to show the direction the object was moving.
