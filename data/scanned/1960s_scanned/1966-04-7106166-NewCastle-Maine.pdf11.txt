The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. As an OCR system, I will now extract all the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw the object.
90°
75°
60°
45° almost due east
30° almost due north
15° almost due west
0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 15 or more time
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
Objects were arranged in a perfectly spaced formation like a flock of birds or an arrow cluster, flying at different speeds, traveling at a slight decline or descent, appearing and disappearing as if pacing a invisible staircase, grouped closely but not side by side, more spread out than arranged in a tight cluster.
