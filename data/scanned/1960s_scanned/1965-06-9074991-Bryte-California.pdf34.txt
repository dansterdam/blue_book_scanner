Dear Sir:

This is probably going to sound to you like a made up story, because no matter how many times my mother and I think of it, and remember it, it sounds like one.

It was about 11 o'clock one night last summer (or maybe this fall) - I was getting ready for bed when I heard a noise. It was not like the usual noises - I'd describe it better as sounding like some kind of machine, but it made some sort of a WHISKING sound which sounded decidedly, especially since I couldn't see the thing that made the sound.

I thought I was hearing things until my mother called, "Karen, what's that funny noise?" Her just as soon as she said that, the sound stopped. At that moment it seemed to me it were clicking.

I wouldn't have said anything to anyone at all but I heard about the UFO's in the Michigan and in the Ohio area.

The day the UFO's were reported in Michigan was about two days before I heard the same noise as before. Before it stayed about 15 minutes, this time about 3.

Believe me, I don't want publicity. My father (Judge Walsh) would kill me if he knew about this letter. (Not really - he'd just yell a lot.) You see I work in his office and he doesn't like kind of publicity.

I just wrote this letter to see if it would be any help to you, and to possibly find out if the UFO's which were seen in your area had any specific noise. Believe me, it would calm my mother and I considerably if we knew we both weren't having hallucinations. 

Thank you.

Sincerely
