This page from the Project Blue Book report does not contain any photographs. The text presented is an analysis of the infrared properties of an unidentified object.

The text reads:

Valoroscopic examination: This preparation when viewed by transmitted illumination was found to consist of sand-grains covered with a carbonized coating.

The greenish object was sawyd in half and the cross section appeared to be made up entirely of green polystrene except for a few black carbonized stronas which appeared to be the same as the carbonized material on the outer portion. No cloth was apparent within the cross section.

Infrared Analysis:
A chloroform extract was obtained from the dirt for infrared absorption analysis. The black extract was found to contain a long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbon plus some aromatics. More aromatic absorption was found in this extract than normally occurs in most motor fuels. The spectrum appeared slightly lower in energy to be that of a fuel oil.

The greenish-appearing material, which made up most of the object, was analyzed by infrared absorption techniques and found to be polystyrene.

A black material scraped from the surface of the object was found to be sand plus clay plus hydrocarbon (probably the same as found in the surrounding earth) by infrared analysis.

Analyses of fibers from the object by infrared absorption methods gave mainly absorption bands for SiO2 (probably from the sand) plus traces of polystyrene and traces of hydrocarbon. The fibers gave other bands which appear in the right wavelength region to be caused probably by cellulose.
