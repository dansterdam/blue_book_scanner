MICHIGAN: Personnel at the Air Force base in the UP western peninsula reported "solen lights connected with seven to eight obiects which hovered over the base for nearly an hour and were 8,000 to 12,000 feet high. They were 2,000 to 3,000 feet in diameter. The obiects were first sighted by an officer at 8:15 p.m. and remained until 9:15 p.m. They were seen by many other personnel on the base who were requested to identify them, but were unable to. They were not flares, but were hovering in a formation, moving east, then west, then hovering again. After about an hour they moved off to the south, slowed to a stop, then accelerated and went off. UFORC Tulsa Office investigated.
