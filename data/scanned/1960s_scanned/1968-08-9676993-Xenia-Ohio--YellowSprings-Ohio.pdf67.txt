I'd like to know how many of the cases that I have listed as solved in the "World of Flying Saucers," are still listed as "unknowns" in your files. If you would let me know, I'd like to re-examine the data and see if we can't get rid of a few more.

Finally, I enclose herewith a UFO sighting of my own, which leaves some uncertainties. I send it, just in case a material object was involved that might have been reported by someone else. I think that my analysis, however, is probably correct. I shall keep watching for a repetition.

Cordially yours,
Donald H. Menzel
