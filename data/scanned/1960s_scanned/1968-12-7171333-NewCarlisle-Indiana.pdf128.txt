The charts in this publication are a continuation of the principal charts of the National Weather Service Publication, "Daily Weather Map". They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500 MILLIBAR CHART, the THICKNESS CHART, and the Daily Precipitation Chart. All of the charts for each day are arranged on a single page of this publication. They are assigned from AD 1-43, Rockville, Maryland 20852. Bulk copies may also be ordered, at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies to the Superintendent of Documents.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the analysis for 7:00 A.M., 6:00 E.S.T. The isobars, or lines of equal pressure, are indicated by solid lines and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500 millibar level.

The Thickness Chart presents the Thickness and Lowest Temperatures for the 24 hour period ending at 7:00 A.M. E.S.T. The isotherms, or lines of equal temperature, are plotted above the station location, and the maximum and minimum temperatures are listed.

An explanatory sheet is available, and single copies may be obtained without charge by writing to the Environmental Science Services Administration, Public Information Office, AD 143, Rockville, Maryland 20852.
