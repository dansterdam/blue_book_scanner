STATEMENT
UFO Sighting

I, Lt Robert H. Kessler, Radar Supervisor R.A.D.C.O.N., on 20 August 1965 at about 2325L tracked a UFO on radar from a position approximately seven miles northeast of Pease AFB. The object appeared on scope and had a steady, round, well-defined return. The size blip a light aircraft would produce. The object and separate but related speed tabs indicated the object to be moving rapidly. The object's speed was observed to follow the same track. Speed was steady. The object did not accelerate or decelerate. When the object passed near the RADCON site, an attempt was made to visually acquire it. No visual contact was made. The Boston Center was contacted and reported no aircraft under their control in that vicinity. There were no further sightings by RADCON.
