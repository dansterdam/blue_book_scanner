Dear Sir:
Enclosed herein is a copy of the U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet, Form A.
This U.F.O. was sighted in 12 August 1950, at LRL's Air Installation, while observing the sky.
It was sighted by the following persons, while observing the sky:
7 persons: 
Both of the observers are considered to be air-lane, but their binoculars, which were being used to observe the object, suddenly became blurred and out of focus.
The object appeared to be about the size of a half dollar held at arm's length.
It did not observe any apparent sound.
The object was then viewed in a 3" x 4" telescope reflecting the same characteristics as in the binoculars.
It appeared and disappeared several times and finally disappeared completely, never to return.
The object's motion was that of abrupt starts and stops not having a steady rate of speed on the bottom started to revolve steadily, increasing in brightness and then the remaining portion of the object disappeared.
Lighted on the east end of the object, this lighted portion was distinct from the rest of the object and it appeared to indicate a structure or appendage on the east end of the object. This also disappeared.
And then the object gradually receded up and disappeared.
