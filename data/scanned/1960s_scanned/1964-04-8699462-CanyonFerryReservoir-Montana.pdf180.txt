There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten document describing an encounter or sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Text from the document:

Here is a true account of what I saw in the night of early spring 1964, a strange object (the size of a car 20 years old) actually slowly flew over, and I saw a ray of light come down from it. Then it stopped at the half moon and each towed it up and said that it had to go to another place again an hour later a brilliant light took off suddenly.
The object was bow shaped and the little light in the center attracted my attention it seemed that someone was directing it with a switch to each side.
The way that it flew was like a child's top when wobbling on its axis, rising higher and higher. At least some more five minutes but it wasn't out of sight entirely. But I didn't look after it much longer.
