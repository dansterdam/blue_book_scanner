The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document. There is no photograph present in this particular image. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Witnesses: Flight Instructor, Field, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Report: Mr. (redacted) was the passenger with (see report). 
The position given was 10 miles north of Austin, Minnesota. The object was seen to converge with the airplane, which was heading North, and which turned to a WNW heading. The object which had initially been at the 2 o'clock position was now at the 4 o'clock position (to the right). It was doughnut-shaped, darker in the center. The object then apparently receded, becoming smaller in angular diameter and losing the doughnut appearance for a solid appearance. Time of report reclined as "14:10" amended to 14:10 (2:40). Thought that report was made to La Crosse FSS.
