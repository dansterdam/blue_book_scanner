ATTN OF: AFCIN-4E2

SUBJECT: Possible Congressional Hearing

TO: AFCIN-4E (Col. Evans)
THRU: AFCIN-4E2 (Col Shoop)

Major Tacker, SAFOI-3d, Hq, USAF, Washington, D. C. called Major Friend 7 June 1960. Major Tacker indicated a very strong concern about an article on a "UFO" incident to be published in a forthcoming magazine article. His particular concern is with the lack of adequate investigation. Major Tacker feels that the next Legislative Hearing will be profitable to sit down with LGL and discuss the situation. The specific details we need for this concern was a case which was brought to the attention of a Virginia Congressman, and had not been reported to ATIC by APRO.

Major Tacker was concerned for Langley Air Force base incident as the fact that the witness was a chronic reporter of UFO's and they did not feel that the case was worthy of investigation.
