Saw UFO in Derry

(report on reverse side)
"We saw the UFO as we were walking along the street. it was just like a plate in the sky, only it was silver colored. it just stood there for a moment and then took off straight up and disappeared."
"We were so excited we ran right home and told our parents."
"I never saw anything like it before in my life - it was round and flat and just hung there for a few moments and then it was gone."
"it didn't make any sound at all when it took off."
