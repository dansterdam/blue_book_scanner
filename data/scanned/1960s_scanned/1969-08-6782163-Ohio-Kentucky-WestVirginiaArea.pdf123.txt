The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, with a handwritten note at the top that says "Refused". The text in the document describes the angular size of a reported object and indicates that the observation would not have been covered by the match head test.

AFR 80-17(C1)

WHEN A REPORTED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IS AN ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENON, SUCH AS PLANETS, STARS, OR OTHER CELESTIAL OBJECTS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS, INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE OBJECT WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE WHICH WOULD A MATCH HEAD COVER AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A DISTANT LIGHT OR BRIGHT STAR APPEARING IN THE FIELD OF VIEW AT THE TIME OF OBSERVATION. GIVE THE EXACT DETAILS OF WHAT THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE AND HOW IT APPEARED TO MOVE, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT WOULD ASSIST IN DETERMINING THE NATURE OF THE PHENOMENON. WHERE A PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN, SPECIFY THE TYPE OF CAMERA AND LENS USED, AND THE EXPOSURE. NOTE THAT THIS PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
