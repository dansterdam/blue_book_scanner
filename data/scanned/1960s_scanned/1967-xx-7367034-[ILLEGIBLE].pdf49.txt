AWAY FROM MY YARD. THE OBJECT WAS AT LEAST LESS THAN 15 DEGREES ELEVATION. IT APPEARED PERFECTLY STATIONARY FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE OR SIX SECONDS AND THEN GLIDED OFF TO THE WEST (SLIGHTLY WE) AT TERRIFIC SPEED. PERHAPS 200 MILES AN HOUR OR MORE. IT WAS ON SIGHT FOR ALL FOUR OCCASIONS UNTIL LOST TO VIET IN THE DISTANCE A LITTLE DARK OBJECT LIKE A TINY LIGHT OR STAR AND THEN WOULD DISAPPEAR. GOT ON AND OFF, NOT ATTRACTED ONLY AS A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT AND FOURTH OBSERVATIONS ESPECIALLY BRIGHT, THESE BRIGHTEST PERIODS LASTED FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AND OCCURRED THESE OR FOUR TIMES DURING EACH OBSERVATION.
WHAT WAS MADE ON A BRIGHT AND CLOUDLESS NIGHT, NOT THAT SUCH THING BEFORE THE OBJECT ABSOLUTELY SEEMED TO BE OF SUCH ENORMOUS SIZE
BACK A LARGE AND IS VERY QUIET. THE SOUNDS OF BOTH JET AND ANOTHER DRIVEN (SEE ATTACHED KEY)
