The text in the document is as follows:

TDEV/UFO(Maj. J Quintanilla/70916/mhj) 23 May 1957
UFO Observation, 19 April 1957

250 Radar Squadron
Attn: 2LT/LT. Wise

1. Reference is to 19 April 1957 radar paint of an unidentified flying object which was reported to the Air Force through Adaic ARS, Oregon. The initial sighting was reported to consist of two objects made by both visual and radar sighters.

In determining if the visual observation and radar paint were of the same object, it is necessary for additional information, distance, and height.
Information are requested if available.

2. At present, it does not appear that the two unidentified objects were related. Adverse weather conditions at the time of the sighting would imply that the object visually observed would have been quite low in the sky.
