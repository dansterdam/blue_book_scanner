The image contains a diagram or sketch depicting the position of an object in the sky relative to the horizon. There is a horizon line and angles marked at 90°, 75°, 60°, 45°, 30°, and 15° above the horizon. The object is shown at various positions above the horizon, with instructions to indicate where the observer first saw the object. There is also a small compass rose diagram in the corner of the image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that best represents the position of the object that you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
