The image appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph or illustration present on this page. As requested, I will proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: -

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of: -

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: N
b. Color: a whitish gray, going to a light to dark gray

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Appeared to be slightly larger than a match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
