Earth's Dust Cloud
Gathers Motion

BIOLOGY - Earth's dust cloud, extending thousands of miles out in space, is now gathering motion, says Dr. Frederick H. Sill of Harvard College Observatory. He says that space experiments should 'weigh' the earth's atmosphere as well as the moon and planets.

PSYCHOLOGY - Curbstone psychology may be helpful, says Harvard's Dr. Jerome Bruner. He believes that the lunar theory is the most plausible today. About 1,000 or more meteoritic objects a day fall into the atmosphere, and the dust remaining in the dust cloud can be detected from space experiments, he reports.

PHYSIOLOGY - In New Zealand, Keith A. J. Wise is working on the question of the relationship between the dust cloud and weather patterns, which it is believed to influence.

ASTRONOMY - The Antarctic Plateau also being used for astronomical observations, and the team of A. B. Dunstan, a New Zealander, has found approximately two dozen centilobos, or astronomical cameras, at the Plateau. Their observations are reported to have a bearing on the dust cloud surrounding the earth.

BIOCHEMISTRY
UNIQUE PLASMA FRACTION CHECK COPPER POISONING
CERULOPLASMIN, a blue copper-carrying protein found in the blood, has been shown experimentally to act as a protective agent against copper poisoning in animals.
This protein, produced by the liver, is the major copper-carrying protein in the plasma of animals ranging from goldfish to humans. Its level in the blood is a good indicator of copper status, according to a report in Science News Letter, 79:37, January 28, 1961.

ON ANTARCTIC PLATEAU
A NEW ZEALAND party lingers and works on the Antarctic Plateau, Keith A. J. Wise, a New Zealander, has discovered that at this high altitude the highest points are found approximately 6,000 feet above sea level. This is believed to be the highest altitude at which any human being has continuously lived and worked.

EDUCATION
WORLD AFFAIRS ROLE
URGED FOR COLLEGES
AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES and colleges are urged to expand their attention to world affairs. Their help is urgently needed to "educate" the nation to the new understandings and obligations in international relations, according to a statement recently issued in New York by a special committee from Government, industry and labor organizations.
