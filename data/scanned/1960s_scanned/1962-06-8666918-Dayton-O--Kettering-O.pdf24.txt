The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a series of questions related to the observation of an unidentified object.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on the path the object took and show any changes in direction during the observation.
21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a pencil at arm's length and measure the width or diameter of the object as seen by the width or diameter of the pencil. This will give the angular size.
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw.
