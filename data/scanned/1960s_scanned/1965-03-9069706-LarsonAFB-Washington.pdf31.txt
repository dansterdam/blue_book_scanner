The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

On March 13 between Hiroshima and Osaka, Japan, two shiny white objects chased two Japanese airliners for over 55 miles. These UFOs accelerated the flights of the airplanes and radically affected the plane's automatic devices and radios. These incidents were viewed as "serious" by international aviation officials. The document mentions that a Convair 340 or Vickers airliner and a small Piper aircraft were involved in these incidents. The document also refers to reports in the Pacific Stars and Stripes, which is a famous newspaper.
