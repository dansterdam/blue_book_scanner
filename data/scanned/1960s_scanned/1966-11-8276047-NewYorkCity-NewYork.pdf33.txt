There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing handwritten text.

The OCR output of the text on the page is as follows:

The object came from the north, moving at a very high rate of speed, appeared very large and shiny, called the subject object. It came from north towards the building, came for a short distance, turned around and went back in the direction it came from. Through the night, the phone calls were made to the police station about this object, but this was the only sighting of the object. But reports of this object came back in saying that the city went high on security, and security guards were on the lookout for anything strange that may be coming in the area. There was no expected light at this point, and no flight plans to our knowledge, so by the coming chaos it could just be an unexpected object flying by.
