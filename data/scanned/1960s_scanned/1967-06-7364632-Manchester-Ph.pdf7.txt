JUNE 18 7:30
The object was first noticed in the sky at about 7:30 PM on June 18. It appeared to be a star or planet, shimmering and flashing with many colors, hovering over the treetops in the southwest. It remained stationary for about 10 minutes.
After about 10 minutes the object suddenly shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view. The observation lasted approximately 10-15 minutes.
The observer, a resident of Manchester, New Hampshire, described the object as circular in shape, about the size of a quarter held at arm's length, and emitting flashing lights of various colors including red, green, blue and white. No sound was heard.
The weather was clear with unlimited visibility at the time of the sighting.
