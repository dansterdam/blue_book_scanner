The image contains a sketch with a curved horizon line and an angled object shown above it. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine that the object was above the horizon and to indicate how high it was. There is also a compass rose in the right corner of the image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved horizon line to show where the horizon (skyline) was when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the line where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. HORIZON CAME OVERHEAD

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
