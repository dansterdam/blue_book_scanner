Text from the document:

On April 7, 1966, at approximately 5:30 p.m., the undersigned Airman First Class, United States Air Force, was on routine patrol in the Northeast section of Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, when he observed a bright light in the northwestern sky. The object appeared to be oblong in shape and was hovering above the tree tops. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before it suddenly disappeared. The object did not make any noise and left no visible trail. The object appeared to be approximately the size of a small aircraft, but was much brighter. The object was observed by the undersigned and several other airmen on patrol at the time. A report of this incident was forwarded to the Commanding Officer.
