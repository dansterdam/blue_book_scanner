Text from the document:

That seem to have some light there. At about 1.30 A.M. when I was awakened the light was well-situated low to the east and lit up the whole area. It first appeared very bright and then grew dimmer. It didn't seem to be moving. I thought about getting up to go out and look at it but decided to wait until daylight. After I got up and looked, it was gone. I didn't see or hear anything unusual other than this light. I am quite sure there were no aircraft or other objects in the sky at that time. The light seemed too big to be a star or planet. I cannot explain what it was or where it came from. It appeared to be about the size of a car's headlight, but much brighter. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else in this area saw the same thing.
