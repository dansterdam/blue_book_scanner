TAC 6-1350 CAN 4 August at 12302 (approximately) the crew of a high-altitude aircraft reported a bright light AB 3500 ft. heading 2290. Location of the aircraft was 28 55 N 145 W.

(1) Ocean station November sighted the same light and reported that it lit up the whole sky as it passed overhead.

(2) Investigation revealed that it was probably an Atlas ICBM re-entry vehicle from Vandenberg AFB. The bright light was from the fire from fuel still left in the booster on separation. This was 1 min 15 sec after the vehicle lit up 12232 and passed out of sight. The missile was no longer visible, but the aircraft was still visible; the aircraft was not exactly sure of the time, but it was in fact one and the same.

On 5 August at 1314Z, several aircraft at 23145W reported a rocket firing from the surface of the sea. The sightings continued rapidly and flew into the clouds on heading 0999. One aircraft also reported sighting the rocket on the water.

A query to CINCPACFLT OPS PLOT revealed that this was a routine operation being conducted in that area at that time.

Also on 5 August at 0900Z, a teenager reported a bright light in the sky. Since no other details were available, and no corroborating witnesses came forward, no investigation was made.
