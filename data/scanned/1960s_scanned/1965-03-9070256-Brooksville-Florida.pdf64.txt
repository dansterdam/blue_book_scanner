Text from the document:

BROOKSSVILLE GPN - It made a whistling noise and shot straight up about 1,000 feet in the air, claims a Brooksville man, calling a flying saucer real. He said he watched it through binoculars for six to eight minutes.
"I couldn't even blink an eye I was so scared," the witness said the creature that lifted off was about 15 feet in diameter and had a bright light on top. He said it had even farther apart than a normal saucer, which made him real uneasy. The object suddenly shot away at a terrific speed.
The flying saucer was seen for over an hour here and Friday evenings by several residents, according to the witness. It was also seen the next day, he said.
HAVE BEEN A CAMERA TO CHIN LEVEL, POINTED IT AT HIM AND HE REVERSED A LITTE AND 1 TOOK OFF FROM HIM toward a remote land area, Reeves said. The flying saucer was described as 50 to 75 feet in diameter and hovered about 50 to 100 feet above the ground on a cloud-like base. It had a semi-transparent plastic type canopy on the top, Reeves said, and in the center a dome area with two windows on top.
