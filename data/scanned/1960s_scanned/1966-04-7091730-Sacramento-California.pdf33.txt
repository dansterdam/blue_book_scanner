The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report that discusses "Probe of 'Flying Saucer' Reports" and how some sightings may just be myths or misinformation, while others could potentially be credible witnesses. The text discusses several specific UFO sighting cases and how the Air Force has investigated the phenomenon.

Probe of 'Flying Saucer' Reports
Police say this "old and ugly" seen in the Schenectady area Thursday evening is a hoax. But the Air Force is thoroughly investigating some of the more than 12,000 "flying saucer" reports it has received for example, where residents scare with plastic balloons with red and blinking lights from propeller aircraft.
REP. GERALD R. Ford of Michigan, the House minority leader, has recommended a Congressional study of the subject, He thinks the House Science and Astronautics Committee should review the "flying saucer" witnesses, as he says there are many credible witnesses.
Since the Air Force has revealed little in its reports and denies that more than 5 per cent of the sightings are identified, perhaps this is the only way fact can be separated from fancy.
IT IS EASY to laugh at those who believe they have seen saucers. But always in history, new discoveries come along that don't seem explainable or logical. The world's scholars were considered very odd when they said the world was round, not flat.
If scientific brothers were considered very odd when they said the world was round, not flat. If scientific brothers wers considered very odd when they said you could fly, as late as 1903, when the Wright Brothers flew, their idea was considered preposterous.
World travellers who said they could prove that man never could fly were ridicuied, as late as 1900, members of the Royal Commission were labeling the idea of sending man into space "as too incredible of success to be considered as a permanent program."
