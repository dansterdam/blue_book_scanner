SILVER BALL SEEN IN ONTARIO

At 12:10 a.m. on Monday, October 1, 1962, a silver ball the size of a basketball was reported hovering near the village of Jarvis, Ontario, Canada. It was first seen hovering about 100 feet above the ground and then rose rapidly out of sight at midnight and no explanations were forthcoming from investigators. The London Free Press informed one inquirer that "it would probably be some sort of phenomenon, perhaps a celestial body." But the observers said "it was different" and that "there have been numerous articles on all this before in the local newspapers." "So, after analyzing all the answers, we never seem to look at another object again like it. Well, that's the way it is." This seems to be good advice, inasmuch as no further explanation is offered beyond what the local press had already stated.
