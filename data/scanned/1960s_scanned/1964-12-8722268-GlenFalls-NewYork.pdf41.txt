The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that includes a celestial timetable for January.

the Northern Hemisphere, and of autumn the Southern Hemisphere. The Sammer begins for us, will come June 21 at 10:56 a.m. EDT. The Autumn will start Sept. 23 at 2:25 p.m. EDT. The greatest eclipse of the Sun in 1965 the most important, will be on July 20, at 3:10 p.m. EST. It will be farther south. Then another will take place between the winter and spring in 1966, visible across parts of the Pacific. The next total eclipse will be on March 7, 1970, most observed across eastern states from California to Washington.

A partial eclipse of the moon, on the nights of June 15-16, will be visible in South America and eastern parts of North America. A partial eclipse of the sun, visible from southwestern Asia and many Pacific islands, although a ring of the sun will not entirely cover the moon, will occur on July 20.

The next total eclipse will occur around the South Pole, last Aug. 2, 1966, but even where it will be visible, in Europe and Asia, only a partial eclipse will be able to be seen. Because of the moon's greater distance from the earth at that time, it will not entirely block the sun.
