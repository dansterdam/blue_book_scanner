Lt. Marley,

I have reviewed this sighting and it seems to fit the description of a balloon launched from Ft. Churchill. However, other stations within a 300 nautical mile radius of the sighting launch radiosondes balloons which tend to fit this description as outlined here by Mr. Robie.

The only way I know to confirm or at least try to confirm the track of these balloons is to request the weather data for the specific launch sites. If you feel that this extra effort is desirable then I will initiate the necessary action acquire the data.

Sometimes weather balloons will develop a leak, as a result they never reach high altitude or their normal size. This could be the case in this instance.

However, since obviously no national threat is indicated and no scientific benefit can be gained, I suggest that the expenditure of the extra manhours and computer time to retrieve this data would not be justified.
