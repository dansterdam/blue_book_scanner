SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, Glassboro, New Jersey

On 6 September 1964, at about 2130 hours, the Glassboro, New Jersey Police Department received a call stating that an unidentified flying object had been sighted in the vicinity of Glassboro, New Jersey. A patrolman was immediately dispatched to investigate. 

Upon arrival at the scene, the patrolman observed a bright light in the sky, approximately 20 feet in diameter, hovering about 50 feet off the ground. The object was estimated to be about 1,000 yards distant and remained stationary for about 10 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight.

The patrolman immediately notified his superiors, and a second patrolman was dispatched to the area. Upon arrival, the second patrolman also observed the bright light in the sky. After a short time, the object began to descend, and both patrolmen approached the area where the object had touched down.

Upon reaching the area, the patrolmen observed an impression in the ground approximately 45 feet in diameter and 3 inches deep. Soil samples were taken from the area and forwarded to the nearest Air Force base for analysis.

The case is under continued investigation.
