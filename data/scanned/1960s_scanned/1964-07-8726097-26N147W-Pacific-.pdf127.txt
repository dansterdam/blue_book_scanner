The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text.

Handwritten text in the image:
Have hard fit 
rather on occasion 
locate vile that 
Hants in scene
than to meet 
crest or ceen vised 
thence our vold 
vein too to be cart 
could not (in perance)
