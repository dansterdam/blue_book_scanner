PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 3 May 61
2. LOCATION: Silver Grove, Kentucky
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 0410302
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. PHOTOS: Civilian
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 min
8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Round lights brighter than stars, traveled very rapidly, distance estimation impossible. They seemed to accelerate and decelerate rapidly, sometimes disappearing and reappearing. The lights were fuzzy or blurred, and there was no tail or exhaust seen. They traveled in a straight line, then made a sharp turn, then straighten out again. Object was seen at about same point. Speed estimated at about 2,000 mph. Second object came on seen same point. Speed about same.
9. CONCLUSIONS: This young history is rather complicated. the objects or signals were seen by radar and visually observed. The radar observation noted a craft entering at high speed near 2,000 mph, then abruptly changing speed, direction, and disappearing from the scope. The visual observation described the same lights, which were observed to make abrupt changes in speed and direction, appearing and disappearing. The witness stated the object was moving so fast that it was unable to determine distance. A visual estimate of speed at 2,000 mph seems possible. The objects or signals displayed the characteristics of high performance aircraft or missiles.
