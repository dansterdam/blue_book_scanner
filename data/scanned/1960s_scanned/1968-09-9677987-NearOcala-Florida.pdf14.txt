No, he would swing a little bit to the side once in a while, and usually to our left. 

By the way, was it a clear night?

At that point it was. There was one storm cloud northeast of Ocala City that had lightning in it, but we were already south of it. We were out in perfectly clear weather.

The reason I asked, is were there any good navigational stars at your 12:00 o'clock position or near your 12:00 o'clock position?

No, not on the horizon. There were some higher, but not on the horizon.

Could you sort of plot this chap's motion with respect to the stars?

Well, he never got as high as, that is, during the time we were watching him in the early phases of it, when he was doing these various actions; he later, I would say 15 minutes after we first observed him, he made about a 10° turn off from our track, and just disappeared in the sky at a climbing angle of, I would say, 10° and disappeared.

Now, in this 15 minutes you covered about how many nautical miles?

Well, were truixng right at 200 miles an hour, whatever that would figure out.
