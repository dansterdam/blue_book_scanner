Buenos Aires and Rosario
Typical of the many sightings of UFOs over the 
cities of Buenos Aires and Rosario, are two reports
that people saw UFOs over the area on July 16 and
thereafter, which drew widespread interest.
In Buenos Aires, at 8:40 p.m., a disc-shaped
object was seen stationary, and a cupola was
visible at its top. The object remained there
for about fifteen minutes, then moved away at
high speed. 
In Rosario, at the same time, a similar 
object was seen and remained visible for some
fifteen minutes before vanishing southwards. Just
before 7 p.m., channel 13 of the local TV service
was blacked out for two minutes. During the 
transmission, radio interference occurred. Simultaneously,
a powerful light was flashed from the object in the sky.

The object was described as being over Buenos Aires 
on UFO-busy nights.
