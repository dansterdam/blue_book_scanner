SUMMARY
For almost two decades, there has been high public interest in the reported sightings of many kinds of mysterious objects in the sky. These aerial phenomena have been called "flying saucers" or "Unidentified Flying Objects" (UFO's) both in the public press and in official documentation.
A series of sightings early in 1966 caused renewed interest in the subject, and the secretary of the air force was requested 1/ to provide information concerning air force activities in the area of reported UFO's to the Armed Services Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. The essential elements of his report are included in this study, together with an historical perspective and details regarding the development of reporting and evaluation procedures for handling UFO sighting information.
Public awareness of unusual flying objects commenced in 1947, now considered to be the beginning of the "modern era" of sightings, and has continued with periodic "waves" of activity to the present. Of the 10,147 cases investigated 2/ by the U.S. Air Force project established to analyze such reports, 9,501 objects have been identified officially as bright stars and planets, satellites, balloons, aircraft, and other known causes. This study is concerned with those sightings in which the flying object remained unidentified; i.e., in which the information available to the investigators is not adequate for analysis, or for which the existing information suggests a hypothesis but the object or phenomenon explaining it remains unidentified.
