REPORT
Their names and Dates
2Th says Mexican towns are quite places.
1 p.m. to 8 p.m. at night. That is have people who are moving objects and they are, I think. Here is a statement of what I saw: Seen some things last night.  they began around 12:20 p.m. A little round thing. It shot up, stopped, and then shot down again. Did this a few times. So bright you couldn't look at. Sometimes it came low over the trees. Then it would go high up and disappear. This went on for about an hour. There were several of them over this period. I called my wife and my brother-in-law to see it but it had quit by the time they got outside. They didn't see anything. I know I saw something strange and I wish I could have shown it to someone else. I don't know what they were. I'm telling you just what I saw. I really don't like to even talk about it, but I felt I should report it. I'm not the type to see things. But I know I saw something that wasn't an airplane or anything like that. I'm not easily excited, but I was shook up over this. It was so bright and fast, and just didn't seem normal.
