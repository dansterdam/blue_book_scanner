There is a hand-drawn sketch in the image depicting an unidentified aerial object. The sketch shows the shape and movement of the object, as well as the observer's location and the direction the object was moving.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? YES Was not watching it. It was just there and then it wasn't. It just seemed to disappear.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? YES If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: a large tree
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? YES
17. a. Sound: I did not hear any sound
b. Color: dark colored and clear (kind of a dark gray or black color) and just a lot of bright light reflecting off the object, accompanied it during its flight pattern
18. Do you know the angular size? Held a matchstick at arm's length to compare the unknown object to known object and it the angular size was not quite as large as the matchstick held out at arm's length, but pretty close, maybe slightly smaller.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and indicate whether the object seemed to be hovering, moving, etc. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
