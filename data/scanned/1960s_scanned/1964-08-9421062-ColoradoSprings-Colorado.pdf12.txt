Dear Sir:

This letter is in reply to the UFO report which you submitted some time ago. The film you submitted was viewed and being analyzed. I regret that the progress has been slow. They were unable to identify any objects for an explanation.

The film consisted mainly of background and family activities, the film mentioning occurred of circular objects with sun-like illuminating bright appearance. These objects would appear stationary, then ascend rapidly and disappear. These scenes were confined to certain areas and on the film were short in duration.

The film was of poor quality, underexposed and difficult to analyze. However, the objects mentioned do not conform to any normal aircraft or phenomena known to us at this time. The film does not show any details that could be positively identified. While the unexplained objects displayed movement and appearance characteristics, the quality of the film precludes any definite conclusions.

I regret that we are unable to provide you with a more definitive report. However, I trust this general information is of some assistance. If you have any questions or additional information, please feel free to contact us.

Sincerely,

Signed
