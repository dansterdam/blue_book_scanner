MEMO FOR THE RECORD
7 OCT 1963
Mrs. called on 7 October 1963. She has been seeing UFOs almost every night for the last year. She sees them about the same time each night (about dark) and they seem to go over and on the hill behind her house. About a year ago Mrs. saw a UFO that was close enough to hit with a rock and her time she saw one that had green and red revolving lights on it. The one she sees every night are white with green and red lights. I told Mrs. Sampson I'd send her a reporting form and the next time she sees one to fill it out and return it to us.
