Dear Messrs. 

I am writing to report an observation on 2 June which I feel may be of interest to you. I observed two objects in the sky which did not seem to be aircraft. They were silent, disc-shaped, and moved in an unusual manner. I would appreciate if you could let me know if this observation can be substantiated.

Sincerely,
