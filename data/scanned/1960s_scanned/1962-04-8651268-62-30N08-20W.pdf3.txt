FIRE : Co. Meath sighting

Mrs. Eileen V. Olean of The Hill, Clane, Co. Meath, reports a strange experience while returning home in her car on the evening of Aug. 4 at about 4 p.m. She says she first observed a large fiery object in the sky, which appeared to be traveling very rapidly and at a high altitude. It seemed to dive down, then leveled off and proceeded in an eastward direction. She says it was considerably larger than a normal aircraft, and she watched it for some time as it moved quickly across the sky. The object seemed to emanate sparks, and was bright and glowing. She says she is quite certain the object was not an airplane or any known type of aircraft. Twice it seemed to change direction. The experience lasted for about 4 or 5 minutes, and the object eventually disappeared from view. The eyewitness says there was more than one person in the car, and another woman also saw the object.
