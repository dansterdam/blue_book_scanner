Forteam Objects In Cuba
On the morning of July 22, 1964, a "great quantity of brilliant objects were seen falling to earth in the Pinar del Rio Province of Western Cuba". The objects looked like various kinds of vessels of the Armed Forces, said the objects looked like various kinds of military aircraft vessels.

The above information appeared in a confidential APRO Bulletin dispatch from Brazil, according to the author. The author noted that there have been some kind of "new model of aggression, hostility, and inhumanity" against the U.S. economy and people by the U.S. of Covert States. The activities of the "basterds" concerned have become so serious to the U.S. economy in relation to the Cuban Province. As soon as they hit the ground, the "halloewen" dispersed, leaving a peculiar substance similar to that of the bacteria cultures. Strong rains prevented gathering of samples for analysis.
