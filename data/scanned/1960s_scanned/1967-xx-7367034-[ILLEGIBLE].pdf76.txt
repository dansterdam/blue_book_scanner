The image does not contain a photograph. The image appears to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book UFO report, with text instructions and a blank space where a photograph would typically be placed.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

IF CROSS X PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW SHAPE OF OBJECT AS OBSERVERD - INCLUDE ONLY THAT PART OF THE PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT AS IT WAS OBSERVED AND ALSO ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

- What particular size and shape would a watch at arms length in front of a known object such as the thing you saw. How much of the watch face would be covered by the head of the object if you held it in front of the object. Estimate what fraction of the watch face would be covered by the head of the object.

The text indicates that the observer should provide a drawing or sketch of the observed object, including details such as the direction of movement and any exhaust or vapor trails. It also asks the observer to estimate the relative size of the object compared to a watch held at arm's length.
