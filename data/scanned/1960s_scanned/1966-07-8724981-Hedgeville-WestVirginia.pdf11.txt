Around 7:15 a.m. a couple observed an object hovering above the ground. The object was hovering and darting about. It would move a short distance, stop and hover, and then move again. The object was watched for around 2:30 as it continued to dart around. It was orange in color and about 6 feet in diameter. It would dart down to within 30 feet of the ground and watch them. Then it would dart up to 1,000 feet. It would emit a slight humming sound as it moved. The observers felt they were being observed by the object. As it approached them, they felt some sense of fear and it then darted away to about 1/2 mile. It would repeat this cycle for around 30 minutes until it finally climbed rapidly out of sight. This was an extremely unusual and unexplained sighting. The observers felt the object was intelligently controlled and under some type of exterior guidance.
