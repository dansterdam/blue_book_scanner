There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a series of questions and fields for the witness to fill out.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it?? if so, how? 
      It seemed to get smaller and then seemed to go into a dark shadow up above.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes  No  Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:
      It seemed to go into a dark shadow up above.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes  No  Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Silent
b. Color: Light grey, turning dark as it went up

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or a man's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
      About half an inch.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
