SOURCE: Civilian
NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3-5 minutes
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual

CONCLUSION: Aircraft(possible)
BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers watched a luminous or blue object which at times appeared to stand still. The object seemed to move on fire then shoot straight up into the air. The object was compared to that of a football in shape and rise. It moved at a very fast pace. One observer said that he could see small lights in the center of the object. The observation is consistent with that of an aircraft.
