This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page includes instructions for the observer to sketch and draw pictures based on their observations of an unidentified object in the sky. The instructions provide specific guidance on where to place markers on a diagram to indicate the object's position and motion.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the compass where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
