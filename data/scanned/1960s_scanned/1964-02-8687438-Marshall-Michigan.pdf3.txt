Dear Sir,
On this date: 2-8-64
at approximately 8:30 p.m. 
near Marshall, Michigan
Dear Sir,
on this day at the above time 
as I was driving south on highway 
27 approximately 1/2 mile south of 
Marshall, Michigan I observed 
in the sky what appeared to be
a large, bright object, oval in shape,
and approximately 75 feet in diameter. 
The object was very bright and seemed
to be illuminated from within. The
object was traveling in an east to
west direction at a tremendous rate 
of speed, much faster than any
conventional aircraft I have ever
seen. The object was at an estimated
altitude of 2000 feet. After observing
the object for approximately 30 seconds
it suddenly disappeared into the darkness.
I am a radar technician by trade and 
I have observed many aircraft in my
time, but I have never seen anything
like this before. I would appreciate
any information you could give me
concerning this incident.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
