The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The page contains a series of questions and responses related to the observation of an unidentified object.

Now I will transcribe the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? yes

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color bright and steady

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, fuselage, etc., and especially show the direction the object was going to show the direction of flight.
