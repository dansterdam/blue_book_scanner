The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed page from an old document discussing Soviet astrophysicist I.S. Shklovsky and his views on extraterrestrial civilizations. The text describes Shklovsky as a highly respected figure in the Soviet scientific community who enthusiastically accepted the idea of extraterrestrial civilizations, despite some of his unorthodox theories.

work in the USSR.

A few remarks can be made about these people.
(1) I.S. Shklovsky is the best known theoretical astro-
physicist in the USSR, highly respected at home and abroad. He is
the past president of the International Astronomical Union, and a
member of the Academy of Sciences, USSR. This is the first
intimation of his interest in the problem of extraterrestrial
civilizations, and his remarks at the meeting were of a general
character, apparently made in his capacity as the host of the
conference. As a serious worker in the problem he can probably
be dismissed.

(2) I.S. Shklovsky is the most picturesque figure in the
above list. He is highly respected abroad for his contributions
to theoretical astrophysics and radio astronomy, yet there is a
streak in his make-up that baffles observers.

He enthusiastically accepted the idea of extraterrestrial
civilizations, criticizing his predecessors Oparin and Fesenkov for
their lack of imagination and "pedestrian" attitudes. His work is
generally brilliant with a few odd ideas here and there.

One of these was his theory that the Martian satellites are
artificial hollow bodies put up by the Martians some half a billion
years ago before the Martian civilization expired. This reasoning
is based on so many wild assumptions that some astronomers were
