Dear Sir:
Enclosed is a copy of a communication sent me for analysis. 
Approach-10 seconds; then-instantaneous stop. (Radar). 
At no time did there appear to be more than one object. 
60-45 mph determined on the basis of the comparison of various observed factors. 
Object was seen at a distance of approximately 1-1/2 miles. 
The time the object was under observation was approximately 10 seconds. To the best of my knowledge the within area were noticed after object completed its maneuvers. object reward distance from object comparable to 13-15 ft or slightly more. 
It is my opinion that the cause of my sighting had distinct characteristics associated with other sightings which seem to be relatively unexplainable as such devices are rarely seen over this area and probably likely in the case of air-advertising. 
Of course I cannot certify with full assurance the information contained herein but believe the account to be substantially correct. I would appreciate hearing from you concerning this sighting.
Very truly yours,
