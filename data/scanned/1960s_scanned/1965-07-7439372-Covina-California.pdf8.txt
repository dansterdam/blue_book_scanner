I have seen many odd objects in the sky, but this was the second one that I could not identify. It was a solid object of some kind, moving across the sky very rapidly, and making no sound that I could hear. The first time I saw an object like this, it was of the same general shape, but much larger. This one seemed to be about the same size as a normal jet aircraft. It was moving very rapidly, and as I watched, it seemed to disappear very quickly, almost as if it had gone into a cloud. This was in the daytime, and there were no clouds in the sky at the time. I just cannot explain what it was.
