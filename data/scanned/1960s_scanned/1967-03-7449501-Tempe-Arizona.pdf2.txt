The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a sketch and diagram. The sketch shows an aerial view of an object or objects, with the observer's position and the object's path indicated. The diagram shows the object's position relative to the compass directions. There are also some handwritten notes discussing the object's motion and arrangement.

As an OCR system, the text I can extract from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the compass where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw it.
90°
75°
60°
45°
30°
15°
0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
(Right to left 2 objects in a bright light, no shape other than a bright light. Over the field - hovering - then the 2 shots - raced each other at a terrific rate - came together and it appeared that one object absorbed the other - then it appeared that there were not 2 but one object at a very fast speed - tremendous stove - a fiery glow. Possibility - ??? observing the effect of its movements.)
