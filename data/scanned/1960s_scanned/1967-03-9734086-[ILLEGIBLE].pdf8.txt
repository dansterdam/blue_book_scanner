There is no photograph present in the image provided. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

As requested, here is the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? yes it disappeared suddenly in a burst of speed.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One):    Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what:  a piece of haze or mist, almost like an atmospheric disturbance.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what: 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound none 
b. Color red, white and blue (a faint blue) pulsing light

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 1/3 or 1/4 the size of a match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

E - low
W - wide
no distinct shape - more like a disturbance from 1 - 2 seconds
