The shared image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a sketch or drawing of a landscape with a horizon in the distance. There are no human faces or identifiable individuals present in the image.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

PELION'S RAPIDS, MINNESOTA
MARCH 8, 1967
I received a copy of the above report and photograph on March 25, 1970 from Lt. Col. Lawrence B. Weeks, USAF (Ret.), who was a UFO investigator for Blue Book at that time. According to the report, on March 8, 1967 at approximately 11:10 p.m. the witness, a private citizen, was watching television at his home in Pelion's Rapids, Minnesota when he saw a bright light outside. He went outside to investigate and observed a disc-shaped object hovering about 50 feet above the ground approximately 150 yards away. The object had a bright light on the underside and emitted a humming sound. It remained in that position for about 5 minutes then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. The witness immediately went back inside and made a sketch of what he had seen. This is the sketch that was included with the report. No other details or information were provided.
