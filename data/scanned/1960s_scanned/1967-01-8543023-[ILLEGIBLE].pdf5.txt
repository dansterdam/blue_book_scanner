Report of Unidentified flying objects over Fillmore, Ill. 
January 29, 1967 

DESCRIPTION: Similar to large helicopter, but without particular sound. Moved slowly and hovered over woodland area. Estimated size as large as a house, but no details could be seen as attached to it.

The "colored lights" on the side seemed more pronounced from a distance, but no particular colors could be determined. There was no noise or movement of any kind from the object which seemed to hover over the treetops, without moving windows, and they moved silently as if suspended.

At intervals, what appeared to be a fine mist or yellowish fog seemed to be produced by the object, but no odor or sound was noted. The only observation was the steady hovering over the wooded area, without any other activities noticeable.

There was no effect on the trees or ground observed, and the lights seemed to be contained within the object itself, rather than focused to the ground or trees. The duration was approximately 300 feet, and the object moved off slowly, without any perceptible sound or motion, and the distinctive silhouette was lost as it descended behind the trees. 

Incident worth to all who seen, either from distance or on the road, and the objective size of the vehicle was estimated. (It seemed quite large in comparison to local landmarks).
