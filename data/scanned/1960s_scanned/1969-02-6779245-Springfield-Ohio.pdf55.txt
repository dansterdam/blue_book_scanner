NEWS RELEASE
NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION
WALLOPS STATION, WALLOPS ISLAND, VIRGINIA 23337
TELEPHONE: VALLEY 4-5311 - EXTS. 224 and 579
FOR RELEASE: FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1969

WALLOPS LAUNCHES 13 EXPERIMENTS
IN A 12-HOUR PERIOD

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration conducted seven chemical cloud experiments between sunset last night and dawn today from its Wallops Island, Virginia, Station.

Liftoff times were 6:11 p.m., 8:00 p.m., 10:19 p.m., 12:00 p.m. (midnight), 2:00 a.m., 4:00 a.m., and 6:13 a.m.

Two-stage sounding rockets were used to carry these chemical payloads -- a Nike-Tomahawk for the first launch and Nike-Apaches for the other six launches.

Two different chemicals--sodium and trimethylaluminum (TMA)--were used in this series, to continue the study of wind structure in the upper atmosphere through a region from around 30 statute miles up to 186 miles. Data on wind conditions were obtained by photographing the motion of the trails from five camera sites within a 100-mile radius of the launches.
