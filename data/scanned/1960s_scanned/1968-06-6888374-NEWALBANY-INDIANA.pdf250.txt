1. Thank you for your letter of July 15, 1968. Your name was given to the Duty Officer on 5 July 1968 (see attached form letter which would have explained that your name was given to us as a witness to an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation on the night of 5 July 1968). We should have conveyed you the attached form letter which would have explained that your name was given to us as a witness to the observation.

2. We received many reports on the night of 5 July that were identified as being natural astronomical sightings. The plane is a Cessna 1/2 that operates between 50 to 60 mph and when the pilot sighting it could not identify it and it was as far as 15 miles away. The sighting was by a number of persons at various locations in the area of Miamisburg, Franklin, West Carrollton, Kettering and Dayton, Ohio on the night of 5 July 1968. We are compiling a report on those sightings which were reported to Wright-Patterson on the nights of 5, 6, and 7 July if you did observe an unusual car on those nights we would appreciate your providing any details.
