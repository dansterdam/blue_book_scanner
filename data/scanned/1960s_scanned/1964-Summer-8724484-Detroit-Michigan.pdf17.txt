Gentlemen: 

From time to time during the past two months, local radio and newspaper stories have reported on flying saucer sightings in other parts of the U.S. As late I have been following these material from the USAF recording on these reports. Although there in mot cases, the stories stated that the USAF was investigating them, could you give me a rundown on the following reports? I shall list the date and location of each: 

April 21, Socoret, New Mexico; April 24, Newark Valley, New York; April 25, near Boise, Idaho; April 29, Carmel, Montana; April 30, U.S. Route 30, Indiana; about May 1, Santa Ana, California; May 8, near Comancho, Indiana; May 15, Interstate 90 near Geneva, Ohio; May 22, Rushville, Indiana.

Now one strange thing has come to our attention but some as a telephone call to us. Radio (Boston) during a discussion of flying saucers, People can call in and the caller identified himself as a air captain have been in those in other crew members had seen a UFO while in the air and that the object had also been tracked on radar by the air traffic people. We stated that the sighting was reported to air control all that he said. I don't know how much of this is factual and would like to know your evaluation of comment. I'll look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Very truly yours,"
