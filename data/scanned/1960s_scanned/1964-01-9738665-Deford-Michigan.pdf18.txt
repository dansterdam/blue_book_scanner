EXTRACTED TEXT:

It just seemed to be moving, not rotating but moving in a straight line quite rapidly. They were about three feet in diameter and hovering several feet above the ground. They made no sound at all and didn't seem to have any lights or markings. There were at least two, possibly three of them in a line, all about the same size and shape. They didn't seem to be connected to or controlled by anything, just moving on their own. it was very hard to tell just what they were as they moved so quickly. My first thought was that they might be some kind of flying object, perhaps some sort of experimental aircraft, but I'm not sure about that. I don't know what they were but I'm quite certain they weren't any kind of aircraft or helicopter. They seemed to defy all the laws of gravity and normal flight as far as I could tell. I'm still trying to figure out what I saw that night. It was very strange and a little unnerving, but fascinating at the same time.
