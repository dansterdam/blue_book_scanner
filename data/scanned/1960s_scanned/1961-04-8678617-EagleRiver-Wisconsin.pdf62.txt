YEAR AFTER YEAR, WISCONSIN
VILAS, the Headwaters County, is located at the top of Wisconsin, the outstanding vacation area of the middle west. With 1,000 named waters, there are more lakes in this county per square mile than any other county in Wisconsin.

Among these are two of the world's longest chain of inland lakes. The Eagle Chain is the 16th longest, while the Cisco Chain, bordering Wisconsin and Michigan, is the third longest.

The Cisco and Eagle lakes, as well as numerous smaller lakes, are rich in both game and pan fish. The state conservation department, under the leadership of Ed Schneberger who was the first in the state to be assigned to the Vilas county area, has built up Vilas into a county to become a rainbow water. One of the first in the state to be placed under this program was the "misky over" for stepped brook trout developed in Ohio's Maumee Lake.

Walleyes get the attention of many anglers and are probably the most popular after the musky. As a matter of fact, in many of the lakes and streams, walleyes supply a great part of the fishing raised in two conservation department pens near Eagle and Phelps, a practice first initiated by the Vilas County lakes. One of these is in Taxarack Pond, 15 acres in the Town of Conover. Two small walleye rearing ponds, bentling the 23 acres, Presque Ude Rearing Pond near the village of Presque Isle. The other is Tamarack Pond, 19 acres in the Town of Conover. Two small walleye rearing ponds,
