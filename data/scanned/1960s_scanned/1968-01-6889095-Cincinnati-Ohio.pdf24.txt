14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
As I was coming out of the gas station and noticed the two light red. I had never noticed anything like this, so I rubbed my eyes and observed from my spot.
A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
When they got to about the height of the trees they just seemed to get dimmer and dimmer until it disappeared. The time they took to disappear from sight was just about 10-15 seconds.
B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
YESAND IF YES, DESCRIBE.
