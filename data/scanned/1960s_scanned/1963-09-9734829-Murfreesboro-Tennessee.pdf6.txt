Egg-Shaped Object in Ark.

Mr. Frank Hudson, from his home near Hoxie, Arkansas, made an interesting observation of an egg-shaped object in the sky at 5:55 p.m. CST on September 1, 1963. The object was moving very slowly toward the southeast, about 10 degrees above the southern horizon, and was visible for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The object appeared as a bright and steady light. Through binoculars the object appeared as an egg-shaped form. A dark spot near the top or large part of the object, was a dark area which was thought to be the middle part or midway between the two ends. As time passed the object faded and turned to a reddish color before it disappeared. However, a student said the object appeared to be glowing, and the possibility that this object may have been a satellite of some kind has neither been confirmed nor disproved. Hudson has seen similar objects in May 6 and 19, 1963.
