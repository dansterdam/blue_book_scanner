There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet (Summary Data) with a handwritten text field filling the majority of the image.

U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may request information that you have already given on the description, but additional information, clarification, and full identification of the observer, location, and the circumstances in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

[Handwritten text is present in the main text field but has been redacted in the image, so I cannot reproduce it.]
