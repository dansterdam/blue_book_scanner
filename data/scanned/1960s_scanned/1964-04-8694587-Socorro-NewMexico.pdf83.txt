Summary of UFO Report received by phone on 25 April 1964:

Caller: Captain Theodore W. Cany, 1005th Special Investigation Group, Wash.
Called at 21:30 EST, 25 April
Call received by OD (Maj K S Samshing*)
UFO data was received by Capt Cany from Lt Col King, Counter Intelligence Division, Albuquerque, New Mexico, who in turn read about it in the local newspaper and also was provided data by the FBI.
The alleged UFO sighting took place at about 1800 MST on 24 April. The object allegedly was witnessed in a rural area on the Stallion Range, Socorro, New Mexico.
The alleged witness was a reputable local police officer by the name of Lonnie Zamora. Zamora was chasing a speeding motorist when he saw the object from the road at a distance of about 200 feet. He claims to have seen two men in white coveralls get into the silver colored football shaped object, about 15 feet long. The vehicle allegedly took off with a roar and an altitude of 20 feet and disappeared rapidly to the west.
Upon investigation of this, the Army (a Captain R.T. Holder of White Sands) reportedly took off the area. Also, the FBI at Albuquerque proceeded to the area and allegedly confirmed that "something" had been there. They reportedly found 1"x5" impressions in the ground somewhat like hand impressions, and the impressions appeared to be burned-black. The newspaper stated that the Army took soil samples.
The above is all Capt Cany could report.
It is surmised that Lt Col King, Albuquerque 268-2107 be contacted for proper questioning of Lonnie Zamora.
