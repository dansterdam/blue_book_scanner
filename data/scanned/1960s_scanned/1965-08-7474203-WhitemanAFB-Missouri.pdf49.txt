LANDING IN NORTH DAKOTA: These women driving their car along a road near Grandin, North Dakota at 11:30 p.m. on August 5 witnessed a brightly-lighted object descend and come to a landing on the ground for about 4 or 5 minutes. It looked to be about 200 feet in diameter. The object remained on the ground until they looked up and saw the real moon in the western sky behind the trees.

The UFO was transparent, and was about 400 to 500 yards from their car. The motion of the object was about the same as that of a falling leaf, rather than a straight-line course. As they were in the form of silhouettes, these men in another car also witnessed the object for about a half hour. Police were called, but found nothing."
