The image does not contain any photograph, only handwritten text. As per the instructions, I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Some people have reported they could see the same thing which appeared on the same date in the area, and the size of the object that was seen varied. It was not large, only about 10 feet in diameter. There was no sound or other phenomenon connected with it which could be called a phospnorescent phenomenon. I cannot explain the reason the object did not shine any longer and could have been something of a controllable nature for 4 to 7 seconds. There were other lights in the area which did not give any explanation for this. They seemed to be very high and appeared to be winking. The photo is being returned herewith.
