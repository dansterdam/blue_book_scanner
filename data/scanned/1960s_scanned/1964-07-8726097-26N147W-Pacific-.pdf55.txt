THURSDAY, JULY 16, 1964--"FLYING OBJECTS PUZZLE NORTH GEORGIA RESIDENTS"

"TOCCOA, GA. (AP) -- One was later to describe as 'about the size of a basketball and traveling at a high rate of speed' passed before the eyes of residents of this north Georgia town late Tuesday night. 

It was the second time in a week that flying objects were reported by residents of the Toccoa area. Last Thursday night several persons reported seeing strange lights move across the sky. And the night before, a similar phenomenon was observed.

The latest sighting came about 11:25 o'clock Tuesday night, when a number of residents reported seeing a bright light come out of the northwest, hover briefly over the town and then zoom off to the southeast.

And the next Tuesday night, came reports of little study-saucer-like objects hovering over a house in the Toccoa suburb of Eastanollee. A local resident contended one was as big as a car and moving silently through the sky, while another said his father had watched through binoculars as the objects circled a house and then darted away".
