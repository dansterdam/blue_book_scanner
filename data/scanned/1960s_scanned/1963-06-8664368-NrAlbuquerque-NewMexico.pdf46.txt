HONG KONG

Over the Peak
From The South China Sunday News.
Passed near the Peak and there was
an unusual and unaircraflike object flying over Hong Kong yesterday.
The object was seen by hundreds
of people on the Peak, and was apparently on a winding course, now
ascending, now descending and whe-
ling in the air. While passing over
the island, it changed colour several
times. It was described as being
bright, shining and sometimes brilliant. At times it seemed to be pulsating.
The object was, according to witnesses, of very considerable size, and
being over a thickly populated area,
caused much interest and amazement among the residents. It was
in sight for about 15 minutes.
Reported by residents on and near the Peak.
