Objects moved very slowly southward, so position unchanged, then stopped. A group of 50 observers with a few 50 binoculars at the objects appeared about 1/4" in diameter, and were apparently detached orange lights. The lights were approximately 5 or 10 in number. The extremely brilliant golden orange color was very steady. There were a series of seven objects, including the 2 original ones, in a group observed through 7x50 binoculars. Another observer had 10 x 50 binoculars. Several of the observers viewed the objects through the binoculars, of approximately 1/4" to 5/8" in diameter, including the peripheral lights.
