The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from an old UFO report document.

Here is the text from the document:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE
STALL STILL AT TIMES, THEN RUN AWAY
SPEED UP SUDDENLY
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS
CHANGE SHAPE
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR
WITH LIKE A STOP
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE
A WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

ET FOR UFO - HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR? 
NOT BE THERE A SECOND
DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? 
BEHIND AND FRONT OF BODY
