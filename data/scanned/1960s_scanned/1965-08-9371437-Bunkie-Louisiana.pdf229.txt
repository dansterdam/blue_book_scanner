"The sighting saucer landing:

KEESLER

The landing of flying saucers is not an infrequent phenomenon, reports reaching the Air Force indicite that on several occasions they have been observed on the ground, having landed for some mysterious purpose and then departed - sometimes under the full observation of the witnesses. Such a case came to our attention in connection with a recent sighting report from Bunkie, Louisiana.

The report states that on 9 August 1965 two Keesler Air Force Base airmen were driving to Bunkie, Louisiana, some 40 miles from the base, when they observed several round, glowing objects in the sky. As they continued to watch, one of the objects descended to the ground and landed in a field. The two airmen drove to within about 300 yards of the landed object and observed it for about 10 minutes. The landed object was described as 30 to 40 feet in diameter, glowing with a blue-white light, and resting on three "legs". After the 10 minute observation period, the object took off vertically at a high rate of speed, and accelerated out of sight.

This is a very credible report from reliable, trained observers; the Air Force has, no doubt, been notified and is probably conducting an investigation. Reports such as this, while not frequent, are not at all rare - the Air Force, indeed, has a number of such credible reports in its files."
