Dear Colonel Evans:

We regret our delay in acknowledging your letter of March 15 but we have been checking every way possible to determine whether one of our pilots reported the unidentified flying object on March 7.

We do not have an airplane C403 and we did not have a flight C403 on the date in question. All flights in the vicinity of Evansville on March 7 have been questioned and any having made such a report.

We are returning the questionnaire attached to your reference letter.

Yours sincerely,
