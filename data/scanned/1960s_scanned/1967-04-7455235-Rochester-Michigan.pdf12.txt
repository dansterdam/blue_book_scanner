Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a photograph or any visual image included in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. The page consists entirely of text with handwritten responses to various questions about an unidentified object observed.

Performing OCR on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It ascended vertically out of sight.

15. Did the object give the appearance of being solid, like a metallic object, or was it a cloud like in appearance at any time, particularly at the beginning or end of the sighting?
(Circle One) Yes (No) Don't know

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) Yes (No) Don't know

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a) Size: Appeared to be about the size of a pencil eraser at arm's length.
b) Color: Light silver or chrome color.
c) Shape: Circular, resembling a metallic coin or disk.
d) Any other distinguishing features: None noted.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. If you had performed this exercise when you first saw the object, how much of the object would have been covered by the end of the match stick?
The object was very small, being only covered by about 1/8 the length of the match stick held at arm's length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your picture any wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or plumes, if present. Also show the direction the object was moving.
