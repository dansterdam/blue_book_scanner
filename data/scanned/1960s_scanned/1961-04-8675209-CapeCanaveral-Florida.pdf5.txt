JOINT MESSAGE FORM - CON. STATION SHEET
ATIC WPAFB OHIO
CASE BALANCE FLYING, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THIS TEST, NOTIFIED THE LOCAL GCI SITE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE UFO. HOWEVER, NO INTERCEPTION ACTION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE THE GCI FPS-10 RADAR PICKED UP THE UFO ONLY ONCE EACH NINE SECONDS AND RECEIVED NO TARGET ON THE HEIGHT FINDER.
PART II. ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE DATA LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TARGET WAS REAL, SINCE IT EVIDENCED TYPICAL RADAR CHARACTERISTICS. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST RADAR MALFUNCTION, OR OTHER CAUSE, BECAUSE THE TRACKS WERE APPARENTLY WELL DEFINED AND HAD A DEFINITE PATTERN. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THIS WAS A RELATIVELY SMALL TARGET, DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT DISAPPEARED FROM RADAR CONTACT AS IT NEARED THE GROUND, AND REAPPEARED AT APPROXIMATELY 44 MILES OUTBOUND. THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON FOR THE INABILITY OF THE FPS-10 TO TRACK TO THE GROUND. SINCE THIS COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE TARGET ALTITUDE, SPEED, OR SOME CHARACTERISTIC OF THE RADAR SET ITSELF WHICH WOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO MAINTAIN CONTACT IN A DEAD AREA FOR THE STATION.
PART III. SINCE NO HEIGHT FINDER DATA WAS OBTAINED, DEDUCTIONS LEAD TOWARD INDICATIONS THAT THE ALTITUDE WAS RELATIVELY LOW. THE MINIMUM REPORTED RANGE OF THE TARGET WAS 10 MILES. SINCE THIS IS SLANT RANGE AND PUSHES SINCE THE MAXIMUM VERTICAL ANGLE COVERAGE OF THE FPS-10 IS 20-30 DEGREES, THE MINIMUM ALTITUDE WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 30,000 FEET WHICH OBVIOUSLY RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UFO BEING AT EXTREMELY HIGH FLYING TARGET. THE PERIODIC HIGH SPEED, AS HIGH AS 600 KNOTS, REPORTED FOR THE TARGET, COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT THE IFT OF THE FPS-10 WAS NOT OPERATING, FURTHER TENDS TO RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UFO BEING A VERY LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT.
