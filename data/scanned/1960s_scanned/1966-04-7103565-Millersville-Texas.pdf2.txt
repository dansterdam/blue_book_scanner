Text extracted from the document:

"Mrs. *** stated that she probably observed the object for a total of eleven minutes, including the time she watched it through her rearview mirror.

1. In response to the investigator's question concerning tail, trail, or exhaust, Mrs. *** stated, "There was no smoke or anything like that, and it was just moving along, making no noise."

2. Investigator's remarks: After the interview, I drove to the scene of the alleged sighting. Concerning the sighting Mrs. *** stated, fields on both sides were recently plowed, and there are scattered farmhouses and barns in this area. The highway runs perfectly straight for several miles. Mrs. *** said that she has driven on this stretch of highway several times a week. 

3. I instructed an Investigator at an Irrigation Equipment Company on the highway in the vicinity of the sighting, and personnel at the said that they had seen nothing unusual.

4. I stopped at a farmhouse occupied by the Sofolk family. Mrs. *** said that this family had been outside at approximately 10:45 Sunday morning admiring newly-born twin calves, and nothing unusual was seen or heard. He said that they remained outdoors for sometime and that the children had a baseball game within 20 yards of the highway. 

d. The only unusual observance made by the investigator was an aluminum fence gate, some distance from the highway, that appeared to have newly risen from the ground. This stretch of highway was with the area of freshly plowed fields, which together with the rising sun, gave an unusual appearance."
