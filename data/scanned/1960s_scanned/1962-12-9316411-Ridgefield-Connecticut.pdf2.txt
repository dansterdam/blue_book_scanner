Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen -

I would like to report a U.F.O. sighted on Tuesday, December 11 at 9:58 P.M. E.S.T. at , Ridgefield, Connecticut.

When I first saw the object it appeared like a huge star. It seemed to shine because the night was very dark - the moon barely visible - very low ceiling. Saturn was west of south.

The object appeared to sway gently - I called to my daughter to see the strange object in the sky. The star "had a deep blue-green light around it more intense near the center". It remained due East of us and was watched continuously for about 10 minutes. Then it just gradually disappeared. It moved very slowly and we could hear a low steady hum.
