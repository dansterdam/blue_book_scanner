VISUAL CONTACT

Commercial Airlines Pilot. S. C. Pierson.
Torrance, California
Route, Dayton, Ohio
Date, March 11, 1962. (Here enclosed)

Dear Sir:
I have just finished the check in of my report on the incident which occurred on March 11, 1962. (Here enclosed) The report is as follows:

At approximately 1:57 a.m. while flying at 21,000 feet on a compass heading of 030 degrees, I sighted a very bright light off to the right and slightly forward of my aircraft. The light was brilliant white in color and was approximately 50 to 100 feet in diameter. It was traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated at approximately 3,000 to 4,000 mph. As the light approached my aircraft, I turned on my landing lights in an attempt to observe it more clearly. As the light passed my aircraft, which was traveling at approximately 320 mph, it appeared to be slightly smaller than my B-707 jet. The light continued on a straight path and disappeared from sight in approximately 10 to 15 seconds.

I immediately reported this incident to the Dayton control tower, and they confirmed that they had also picked up the object on their radar and had been tracking it. They stated that the object had been traveling at a very high rate of speed and had disappeared from their radar screens.

I feel that this was a very unusual and unexplainable incident, and I would appreciate any information or comments you may have regarding this matter.

Sincerely,
S. C. Pierson
Commercial Airlines Pilot
