NICAP URGES PROBE OF NEW UFO SIGHTING WAVE 

The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) today urged the Government to establish a tracking network and make public the recorded UFO speeds, shapes and maneuvers.

NICAP also urged an end to official secrecy, and fully backed the demand for a Congressional Investigation by Rep. Gerald Ford (R., Mich.).

According to the Air Force, NICAP stated, over 200 military and civilian pilots who have reported UFO encounters are incompetent or deluded. In the same way, NICAP said, hundreds of military and FAA traffic controllers and radarmen, rocket and missile trackers have been ridiculed. In addition, thousands of other competent citizens -- lawyers, doctors, corporation heads, editors, reporters, newscasters -- have been openly belittled after making UFO sightings public.

The Air Force "swamp gas" explanation for unknown flying objects seen at Dexter and Hillsdale, Mich., were rejected by NICAP and by the witnesses involved. There have been press reports that the Air Force's No. 1 consultant, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, was ordered to release this explanation, and Hynek has admitted that he "could not prove it." (Dr. Hynek has since denied that he was pressured.)

The new wave has spread to Colorado, Maryland, Georgia and other states. Near Albany, N.Y., a low-flying UFO was reported to have chased a car.
