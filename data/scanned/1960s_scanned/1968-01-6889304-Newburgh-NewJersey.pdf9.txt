1. At 1729 hours, 10 January 1968, my wife _____ and I was driving home to our quarters at Newburgh, New York, when I noticed what looked like a red star just above the trees in front of my car. I asked my wife what it was and she replied, "Probably Venus."

2. I pulled into the parking lot and proceeded to back the car into the first parking space nearest the building. As I turned off the engine, I thought I saw the object move towards us. I asked my wife if it seemed the same to her and her reply was, "Yes."

3. We got out of the car and stood in the parking lot observing the object which had changed to a brilliant yellow. It still appeared to be moving toward us because I felt it seemed to be getting closer, and I found it was definitely moving. All at once the object started to change its color to red and then proceeded to stop and hover. Such movement was extremely rapid, seeming to make a ninety degree turn to the south and stopped just as before. At this time, the object was located approximately in the Northeast sky at about a thirty-five to forty degree angle in proportion to the horizon.

4. The second time the object stopped and "hovered," I observed a small red streak and the object disappeared. For a few seconds, I spotted the object out of the corner of my eye to the far south of me. From the first disappearance to the first reappearance, the time lapse was from five to ten seconds.

5. I told my wife to quickly go into our apartment and return with my Scope (15X-60X-60MM Called Variopowert Telescope).
