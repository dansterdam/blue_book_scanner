The witness was awakened by a loud noise and observed bright lights in the sky. The lights were described as round, pulsating, and hovering below the tree line. They emitted a high-pitched whining sound and were visible for about 10 minutes before gradually fading from view.

The witness claimed the incident was similar to previous sightings in the area, but this was the closest and longest duration of the phenomena observed. No identifiable aircraft were seen in the vicinity and the witness was unable to determine the source or nature of the lights.
