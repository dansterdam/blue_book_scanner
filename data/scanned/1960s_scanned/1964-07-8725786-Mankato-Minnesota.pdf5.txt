August 12, 1954

Dear Mr. [redacted],

1954 was a very unusual year in the annals of UFO sighting history. On July 12, 1954, your letter was received indicating your observation of a strange object on July 10, 1954. This satellite-like object you observed was certainly a most unusual sighting, and I regret to say it has defied a completely satisfactory explanation. The object was apparently a very high-flying airborne vehicle, but its exact nature and origin remains a matter for speculation.

We are continuing our efforts to obtain a more complete explanation. Sincerely,

MASON M. JACOBS
