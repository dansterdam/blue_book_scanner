THE AIRCRAFT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT BECAUSE THE FULL SUPPLY OF GASOLINE WAS LOW, AND IT ALSO STOPPED RADIOING PERSONS ON THE GROUND. SEARCH WAS ONLY ABOUT ONE HOUR OF SEARCHING. WITNESSES ON THE GROUND SAY ANY UNUSUAL BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SKY OR ON THE GROUND. 20 PEOPLE AIDED IN AIRCRAFT CONTINUING THE SEARCH ON 17 JANUARY 1961 FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR. AFTER SEARCH ALL WEATHER PREPARLING OFFICER FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR TO SPECKAGE, GROUND HOLES, BURNT SPOTS, OR OTHER EVIDENCE OF THE OBJECT WAS FOUND. PROBABLE PHYSICAL DAMAGE WAS NOT A RESULT.  THERE WERE NO REPORTS OR EVIDENCE OF AN AIRCRAFT IN PROXIMATE REAL TIME SIGHTING.  THE PREPARING OFFICER AND WITNESS BEING REPORTED, IT IS BELIEVED THAT WHATEVER THE OBJECT AS THEY DESCRIBED IT, WAS NOT AND IS NOT CAPABLE OF AERIAL PERFORMANCE AND SPACE-CRAFT. THIS SIGHTING IS A SIMILAR ERPORT TO PREVIOUS LESS CONCLUSIVE SIGHTINGS.
