The observers were watching an eclipse of the moon when they sighted a flat disc-shaped object with a dome. It had an extremely brilliant white pulsating light on the "head-on side and clear, brilliant red blinking red lights across the side.
COMMENTS: The description is similar to that of an aircraft with advertised advertising signs. One advertiser who operates in the area was contacted but stated that it was not his plane. If the object had continued NNE it would have passed over Biddeford and Saco, Maine. No one reported any UFOs to their police departments. Peace AFB and Portland-Sanford Airport are only 10 to 15 miles SSW of the sighting and OVER.
