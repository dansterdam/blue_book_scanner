Bright Jupiter Seen
On January 21, 1960, at 8:05 p.m. (MST), a bright object was seen in the southwest sky near the horizon. It was first noticed by numerous observers in the Las Vegas, New Mexico, area and was quickly confirmed by others in that vicinity as well as in Santa Fe and Albuquerque.
The object appeared to be much brighter than a first magnitude star, possibly as bright as the planet Venus at its maximum brilliancy. It was steadily bright, without any noticeable fluctuation in intensity. The object remained in the same position for about one hour, after which it began to fade and disappear below the horizon.
After careful consideration of the details, it has been concluded that the object was the planet Jupiter, which was then in that part of the sky. The great brilliancy was caused by the fact that Jupiter was at that time in opposition to the sun, being on the opposite side of the earth from the sun. Under these conditions, the planet appears at its maximum brightness.
Know the Sky
The first step in identifying any celestial object is to become familiar with the position and movements of the bright planets - Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Mercury. In addition, a knowledge of the positions and motions of the stars themselves is also helpful.
The early lunar observers, though lacking the sophisticated instruments of today, were often able to identify celestial objects with a high degree of accuracy. They became quite familiar with the appearance and motions of the moon, planets, and stars.
