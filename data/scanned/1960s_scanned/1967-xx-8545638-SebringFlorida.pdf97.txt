FEET ("APPEARED 6" ABOVE THE HORIZON"), AND WAS A BRIGHT "SILVERY" 
WHITE" IN COLOR. THE SHAPE WAS DESCRIBED AS "CIGAR-SHAPED, WITH BOTH 
ENDS SYMMETRICAL". IT WAS MOVING ALONG ITS LONGITUDINAL AXIS.
NO NOISE WAS HEARD FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE OBSERVED OBJECT, NOR 
WERE THERE ANY WINDOW, PORTHOLES, WINGS, FINS, ANTENNA OR OTHER 
PROTUBERANCES OBSERVED. NO SMOKE OR FLAME WAS OBSERVED. NO OTHER 
OBJECTS OR AIRCRAFT WERE OBSERVED IN THE VICINITY DURING THAT 
PERIOD. IN FACT, DURING THAT PORTION OF THE AFTERNOON,
AT THE TIME THE OBJECT WAS UNDER OBSERVATION, A TUG TOWING A 
BARGE CONTAINING A SQUARE OR RECTANGULAR OBJECT MARKED "TMI" WAS 
OBSERVED. ALSO HEADING SOUTH. AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME DISTANCE 
AWAY, WHEN THE FLYING OBJECT CAME INTO VIEW, MRS BRAY WENT INTO THE 
HOUSE AND RETURNED IN ABOUT 1/2 MINUTE WITH A PAIR OF 12 POWER 
BINOCULARS. BEFORE SHE COULD EMPLOY THEM, THE FLYING OBJECT HAD 
DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW TO THE SOUTH, BUT SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE OUT THE 
LETTERS ON THE CONTAINER ON THE BARGE BY MEANS OF THESE BINOCULARS 
("TMI").
THE FLYING OBJECT ATTRACTED THEIR ATTENTION DUE TO ITS UNUSAL SPEED
