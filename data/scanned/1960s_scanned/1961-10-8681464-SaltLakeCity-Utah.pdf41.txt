A SALT LAKE CITY CIVILIAN PILOT REPORTED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ON SEP 7, 1961 AT SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH. SEVEN PERSONS OR ITS GROUND SAID THEY ALSO SAW IT.

THE SALT LAKE CITY INSURANCE MAN, SAID HE SPOTTED THE OBJECT AS HE WAS TAKING OFF FROM THE UTAH CENTRAL AIRPORT. HE SAID HIS FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS A AIRPLANE, BUT WHEN HE GOT CLOSER HE NOTICED THAT IT WAS STILL IN THE SAME SPOT AND HAD NO WINGS OR TAIL.

HE SAID IT WAS GRAY LIKE DULL ALUMINUM. PUT WHEN I TURNED TOWARD THE SUN, IT SHONE BRILLIANTLY LIKE GOLD REFLECTIVE QUALITY, AND THE SEVEN OTHER WITNESSES, ALL OF WHOM WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, TOOK STATEMENTS FROM ALL OF THEM WHO WATCHED THE OBJECT.

THEY SAID ITS RADAR SCOPES DIDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT. IN WASHINGTON D.C. THE AIR FORCE COMMAND POST SAID IT HAD NOT HEARD OF ANY SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.
