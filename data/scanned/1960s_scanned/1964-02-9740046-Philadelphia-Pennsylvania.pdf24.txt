Lieutenant,

Report of sighting of unidentified flying object:

On November 23, 1963, at approximately 2:49 a.m., I observed an unidentified flying object in the eastern sky over Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The object was observed for approximately one minute. It appeared to be round or oval in shape, and was emitting a bright light. The object moved in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed, and then accelerated and disappeared from sight.

I would like to request that this report be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
