The image appears to contain a simple line drawing of what looks like a UFO or unidentified flying object. The drawing shows a rounded, saucer-shaped object with two small circles or openings on the top or bottom. There is also a small stick figure-like shape labeled "U.F.O." next to the drawing.

Text from the document:
