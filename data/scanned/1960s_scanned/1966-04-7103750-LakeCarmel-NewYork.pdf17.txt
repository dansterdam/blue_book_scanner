14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
The object disappeared when it appeared to descend behind a group of trees.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
No, it did not move behind anything.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
Yes, it appeared to move in front of some trees.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - No sound
b. Color - Looked like a very bright silver-white object

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The match head would have covered about 2 degrees of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
