The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Proposed reply to Action Line ltr, dtd 5 Nov 69.

1. Reference your letter of 5 Nov 69. UFO reports should be reported as soon as possible after the sighting to the nearest Air Force base. As required by AFR 80-17, each Air Force base has a UFO investigator who undertakes an initial investigation. If the stimulus is identified at the local level, no further action need be taken. If the local investigator is unable to identify the stimulus, the report is forwarded to Project Blue Book headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio where a more intensive investigation is undertaken.

2. investigator was forwarded to the Air Force UFO investigating officer at Chanute Air Force Base. This investigating officer completed a UFO reporting form per a telephone conversation with Mr. [redacted] on 17 Nov 69. Analysis of this information indicates that the sighting contains some internally conflicting points.

3. A partial analysis made by the local investigating officer reads as follows: "Assuming an elevation angle of 50 degrees is correct, and using a conservative estimate of 3000 feet, the object must have been approximately 1200 feet in diameter. If the object would have been suspended at 14,000 feet, a time of approximately 10 minutes from the first sighting to disappearance would be required. Using trigonometry, the object would have to be 630 feet in diameter. In view of the above description, it is difficult to even partially disappear as described."

The greatest criticism lies in the fact that apparently the object was seen simultaneously from 6 miles ESE of O'Hare Airport and 6 miles SSW of Chicago ASRY. I contacted both Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted]. ASRY I contacted both Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted]. ASRY
