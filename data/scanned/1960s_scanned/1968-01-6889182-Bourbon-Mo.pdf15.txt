There was a bright light in the sky of a peculiar nature. It was different from other lights and airplane navigation lights that I have seen. Its movement was slow and erratic, not like an airplane. It remained in view for several minutes. There was no sound associated with the light. The light was brighter than the surrounding stars in the sky.
