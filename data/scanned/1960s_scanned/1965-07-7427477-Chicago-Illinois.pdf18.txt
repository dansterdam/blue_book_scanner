There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report document.

The text in the document reads:

Dear Mr. E. J. Ruppelt:
This is in reply to your report of aerial objects which you could not identify on 25 and 26 July 1965.
Your sightings have been evaluated as probable observations of stars, satellites, or meteors, rather than unidentified aerial phenomena. The reported observations do not appear to be of anything out of the ordinary and are likely explainable as light phenomena due to atmospheric conditions, such as weather conditions or temperature inversions.
The report from Cannon Air Force Base on 23 March 1957 was an investigation of radar and visual observations. This information was released by the Air Force to the press. The phenomena Air Force fighter Center found no connection with the observations.
We have no reports from Clovis, New Mexico, on 2 or 3 November 1957.
The books by Donald Keyhoe are considered by the Air Force to be science fiction.
Sincerely,
JOHN L. SPAULDING
