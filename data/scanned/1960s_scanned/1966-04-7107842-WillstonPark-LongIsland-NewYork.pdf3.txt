The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text states that the object was observed for the traffic signal at Hempstead, the object was hovering above the rest area, and the sighting lasted approximately 3-6 minutes. The text also mentions that the object appeared to be a "slow-flying plane".

When a UFO sighting is reported, the authorities gather information, and this document appears to be one of those reports from Project Blue Book, a real U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings in the 1950s and 1960s.
