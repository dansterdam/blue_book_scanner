MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1. Central Airlines Agent

22:30 1 August 1962 - A telephone call was received at this office from a Central Airlines agent at Liberal, Kansas, who related the following:

At 21:50 1 August 1962, a telephone call was received by the agent from a woman who stated she had observed an unidentified flying object in the sky. The object was described as being round and glowing with a reddish-orange color. It was estimated to be about 1000 feet in altitude and moving in a northeasterly direction at a high rate of speed. The object was visible for approximately 2 minutes.

The agent stated that he was looking like an "aircraft" and was not familiar with the object's movement or appearance as compared to normal aircraft. He was unable to identify the object. The report was called in for information purposes.

There were numerous phone calls made to the Communications Center at this base in reference to the sighting mentioned above. Initial contacts seem to indicate that the object was also observed by other persons in the Liberal, Kansas area, and was stated to be a white or silver object, moving from southwest to northeast at a high rate of speed. The object was reported as leaving a trail.

In the opinion of the agent, the trajectory and apparent size of the object does not seem to fit the characteristics of a jet aircraft or some other conventional type aircraft. The object was described as moving erratically and was not identified.
