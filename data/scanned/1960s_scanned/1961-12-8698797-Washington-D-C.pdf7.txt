The image contains two sketches. The first sketch depicts a curved object above the horizon line, with the instructions to imagine that the object was seen above the horizon. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road with buildings and trees in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this.
