Dear Sirs:

I have written this to make you aware of a physical phenomenon, quite similar to
my sightings of the 11th and 12th of December, 1966.

On the morning of July 6, 1967, at exactly 2:18, I again sighted two luminous objects, much brighter and closer than the one which was bright-white and followed the preceding one by about one second. This one widened from a narrow point and extended about 360 above the northeast horizon (indicated on diagram). Both were silent and did not interfere with radio reception.
