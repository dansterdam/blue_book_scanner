Bureau of Land Management, Reno, Nevada

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object

Sunday night, September 24, 1961 at 11:40 P.M. (PST), a mile north of the Five Creek Ranch, Nye County, Nevada, the following occurred:

At that time I stopped my vehicle and observed an intensely large, bright, light hovering over the high mountain ridge in the Toquima Range. This mountain ridge was in the direction on the south slope of Andrews Canyon. I observed this unusual object for about five minutes during which time it remained in a vertical position and then went out. It was a brilliant white light, and in contrast to the darkness of the night it was easily seen and could be watched for at least five more minutes as it went out or switched off.

I immediately placed a collect call at 12:35 A.M. to the Central Intelligence Agency, Washington, D.C. The operator rather than to continue disturbing the ranch people, I then drove to the Frontier Tavern, a business establishment located about twelve miles east of Austin on Highway 50. There I picked up a telephone and again reported the observation as I had to the CIA.

In my opinion, this was no conventional aircraft. It was an object foreign to our normal experience, and there are no known aircraft that could execute the maneuver I had observed.
