Dear sir or madam,

According to the information given, this appears to be a handwritten document from the Project Blue Book UFO investigation files, specifically relating to an incident that occurred on July 3, 1968 in Thousand Palms, California. The text appears to be a witness statement or report describing the observed UFO event.

The text reads as follows:

"Please consider this a report of a sighting of a very bright light in the sky, which appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed and then suddenly stopped and hovered in the sky for several minutes. The object then accelerated and disappeared from sight. This was observed by several individuals in the Thousand Palms area on July 3, 1968 at approximately 9:30 p.m. The object was observed for approximately 3-5 minutes before it accelerated and disappeared. I am writing this report at the request of the Air Force, who was notified of the sighting. Please let me know if you require any additional information regarding this incident. Sincerely, [Signature]"
