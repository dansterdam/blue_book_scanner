WORLD PEACE
The population of America is made up of people from all of the countries of the world, being called "the melting pot" of the world. They have come from all races and religions. They have been accustomed to the best and most hopeful chance for ending wars and getting peace.
It seems to be the best and most hopeful chance for ending wars because we are a country made up of all kinds of people from all over the world. We have been accustomed to getting the "best and most hopeful chance for ending wars and getting peace."
The text goes on to discuss how in any future conflict, restraining or eliminating war would be far more drastic than ever before, as war would destroy and demoralize the people and the country.
The document is signed by E.G. RISIEN in San Saba, Texas on August 9, 1947.
