"First Night Color Shot Of Flying Saucer Bared

The most famous photograph in the world this year is the one on this page. It shows a glowing, color image of a flying saucer taken in the dark at an undisclosed location.
The image was captured with a high-speed color film and a wide-angle lens on a 35mm camera. Several observers reported seeing the strange object in the sky and the photographer was able to get this shot, which is the first night color photograph of a flying saucer.
The object, clearly defined in the photograph, shows a circular disk-shaped craft with several portholes or windows which many have speculated contain occupants. The craft appears to be hovering or moving slowly through the night sky.
The picture was taken at about 2:15 a.m. on September 21, 1965 in the vicinity of Carson City, Nevada. It was taken by an unidentified person and later obtained by the Air Force as part of Project Blue Book.
The craft was apparently lit from within, giving off an eerie yellowish-blue glow. This glow makes the details of the craft clearly visible in the night sky. The photographer said he was awakened by a bright flash of light and was able to grab his camera and get several shots of the craft before it moved swiftly away.
The Air Force has made no statement as to what the object may be, but they have confirmed the authenticity of the photograph. They are continuing their investigation to determine the true nature of the object.
This is said to be the most famous photograph of a UFO to date and may provide valuable clues to the continuing mystery of the existence of flying saucers.
