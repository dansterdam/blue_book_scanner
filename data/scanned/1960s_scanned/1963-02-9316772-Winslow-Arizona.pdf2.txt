FIELDS
Tiny Circuits Cut and
Pierced By Electron Beam
THE ELECTRON beam much
cuts and drills circuits on
silicon and germanium chips
for electronic components.
The electron cutter-welder works like
e electric tool, cutting and piercing the
circuits. The beam leaves no debris, and
it is possible to lay down circuit patterns
much smaller than possible with ordinary
electrical techniques.
The process of etching circuits on
silicon semiconductor chips by using a
focused electron beam to remove se- lected
areas has been pioneered by the General
Electric Company at Schenectady, N.Y.
Ocean Rivets Measure
By Depth-Seo Devices
OCEAN CURRENTS will be
measured accurately with new
depth-sounding devices developed by the U.S. Navv's
Bureau of Ships and the National
Oceanographic Data Center. These new
units are claimed to measure depth to 0.1%
of the deepest reading, as compared to 7â€°
accuracy possible heretofore. The units
measure at any depth, velocity and direction
of currents. Data are collected on 15 inch
magnetic tapes and later analyzed by computer. This method will sharply improve
knowledge of ocean currents.
Earth's Crust Found
Thicker in Colorado
THE EARTH'S CRUST is 30 miles thick
in eastern Colorado, only 10 miles thick in
California. New measurements by the U.S.
Geological Survey, using seismologically
detected boundary surfaces, indicate the land
profile of the earth's crust in the western
United States is 40 to 45 miles thick under
the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, but only
20 to 25 miles thick in California.

The conclusions about the earth's crust
are based on a net,
work of about
2,000 seismic stations in the western
United States. The
new evidence from
eastern Colorado
confirms earlier estimates from eastern Colorado
that the crust there is thicker than previ-
ously thought.
BIOLOGY
Tiny Yeasts Survive
30 Years in Antarctica
AND the living units from the bodies of
bacteria have survived more than 30 years
in the frozen soil of the Antarctica, and
have been revived after being sealed in glass
ampoules since the expeditions of Admiral
Byrd to the Little America base in the early
1930's.

The frozen and dried bacterial cells,
stored under seal in the Antarctic from a
time when President Hoover was in office,
have been cultured in the laboratories of the
University of California at Berkeley, where
scientists report two types of yeasts, a kind
of mold and other microorganisms have
been grown from this ancient material.

The food cache, in which the jars of yeast
and bacteria were sealed, was destroyed, but
the bacterial matter in the sealed glass containers was preserved. The story was related
in Science, January 25, 1963.

ingesting metallic lead shot, not by eating
birds with lead shot in them.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated through studies that 2-3 percent of
all ducks die each year from eating lead shot
left in marshes and fields by hunters. This
amounts to the loss of nearly 2 million ducks
annually.
