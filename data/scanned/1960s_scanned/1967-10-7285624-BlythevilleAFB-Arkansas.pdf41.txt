TDPR (UFO) MAJ QUINTANILLA/70916/MHS/16 MAR 60
UFO Observation, 21 October 1957

Dr. Charles F. Oliver
American Meteor Society

1. The aerial phenomenon (UFO) appears from Blytheville AFB, Arkansas, which occurred on 21 October 1957. The duration of the observation was thirty to forty-five seconds.

2. The observers sighted a bright white object to the south of the base. The object was described to be moving rapidly (direction not specified) and was described as being similar to a jet with afterburners. However, there were no scheduled aircraft in the area at the time and there were no targets on radar that could be correlated to the sighting.

3. Do your records indicate that any bright meteors passed over the southern United States at the approximate time of this sighting? If so, could it have been the cause for this sighting?

4. Thank you for your assistance on this matter.
