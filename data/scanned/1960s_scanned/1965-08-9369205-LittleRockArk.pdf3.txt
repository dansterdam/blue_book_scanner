24 Aug 1965

Dear Sir,

I am very interested in the unusual sightings of unidentified flying objects which my family and I have observed. It is the first time I have reported anything like this, but this is the closest approximation to describe what we saw.

The object looked like a large star that was very slightly larger, with a very slightly bluish white color.

The sighting was at about 7:35 P.M. Monday, August 16, 1965.

The object looked like it moved or traveled at a very high rate of speed up and then disappeared from view. I would appreciate it if you would send me some report forms under my report number.

Sincerely,
[redacted]
