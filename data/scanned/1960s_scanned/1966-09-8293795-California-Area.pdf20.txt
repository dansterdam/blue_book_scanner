yard during the night in
the summertime under the
full moon. I saw what appeared at
night and in the morning it was
still there. This may be of interest
as it happened to notice
it and decided to watch it. It
kept gradually changing its
position while hovering on and off
the ground. Several times it
went up and down. The light
was very bright. It never 
moved around too much,
just moved up and down. It
left in the morning. I went to
the tree and found the limb
where it had been. I could not 
figure anything more than
I have told you. Quite a
strange thing, wasn't it?
