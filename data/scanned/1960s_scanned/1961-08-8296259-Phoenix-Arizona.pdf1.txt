"Long car burned up .... jumped out up .... sight radiaish glow was oberved ..... 2 hr period. What appeared to be black billowy smoke was observed to be rising from the object ..... interval varying from secs ... with no time fixed at point of observation."
11. COMMENTS: Separate sheet indicates:
"Civilian observers indicated a mile low flying object that was dropping flares. However, low can not be accurately estimated and the object may have been further away than observers indicated up to a few miles. No other confirmation of this sighting could be obtained and observers felt that they must have seen something very unusual as their description does not fit any known aircraft or celestial phenomenon".
