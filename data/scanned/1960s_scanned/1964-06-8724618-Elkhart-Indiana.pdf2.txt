Dear Sir:

This enclosed clipping which appeared in our paper this week was of particular interest to us as my husband and daughter had a similar experience.

It happened one evening two or possibly three weeks ago about 5:00 p.m. My husband and daughter were coming up the driveway on their way home ready for supper. They turned from Co. Rd. 13 on to our driveway (we live halfway down the first block). Suddenly they saw this bright object come from our house and streak across the street and disappear between the houses on the other side of the street. They said it looked like a large ball of fire. It happened so suddenly my husband could not tell from which part of the house it came. We went outside and looked around but could find nothing irregular. Our neighbor who was watching TV said she saw a flash of light but thought it was someone near taking flash pictures. Later we did find a patch of grass that had been scorched a little larger than a dinner plate. It was in the back yard between the house and garage. We also found a similar patch in the front yard that did not appear to be of the same size. Those spots are now beginning to turn green again.

This incident was not reported to the police because the way it happened was so suddenly nothing except what they saw. Incidentally, this happened on a clear, starry night.

Sincerely,
