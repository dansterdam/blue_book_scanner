AT ABOUT 5:30 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING ON JUNE 24, 1961 A LARGE BRIGHT OBJECT WAS SEEN BY TWO WITNESSES AT ROSE CENTER, MICHIGAN. IT WAS FIRST THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE A FAST MOVING AIRCRAFT OR SATELLITE BUT UPON CLOSER INSPECTION IT WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING UNUSUAL. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING LARGER THAN A JET AIRCRAFT AND VERY BRIGHT, ILLUMINATING THE GROUND AROUND IT. IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER A FIELD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE SUDDENLY ACCELERATING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING FURTHER SIGHTINGS IN THIS AREA IS BEING SOUGHT.
