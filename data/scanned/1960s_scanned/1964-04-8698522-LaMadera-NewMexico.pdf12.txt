As indicated in the previous report, this case was investigated by Lt. Fitz of the 1st Air Force, and the following additional information was obtained.

The object was reported to have been observed from about 1200 to 1230 hours on 8 April 1964 by several persons in the La Madera, New Mexico area. It was described as a bright, metallic, disc-shaped object which hovered over the area for about 30 minutes.

Several witnesses reported that the object appeared to descend to within a few hundred feet of the ground and then rapidly ascended and disappeared from view. No sounds were heard from the object.

The investigation revealed that there were no aircraft or other known objects in the area at the time of the sightings. The case is considered to be unexplained.
