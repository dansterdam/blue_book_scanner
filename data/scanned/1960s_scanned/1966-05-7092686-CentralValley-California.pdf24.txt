The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

After watching it for a while we crossed over to the rear of my house. From there we could see another good object that was much more illuminated than the one we were watching. This object was now to the west and in the first quarter. We then went back to watch from the same position, but these objects could not be seen again. Even though the night was very still, we could hear no sound from the objects. After watching to go home, I went and told my neighbors about the sighting. I saw more object with a silver dome, crossing very silently. It seemed to drop down towards the south-west and then started back up, watching to go home. As I arrived it had just crossed over the high tension wires, behind the trees, and out of view. As I began to turn off the porch light, and look to the left from the tree, I saw a large red object in the same position as previously, hanging there, and, another. Four in all - the first having led was out of view; but the three following were one behind the other. We could hear a sound but it was some kind of a sound but we hastened. The time was about 9:30 p.m. and we also sighted a USA experimental plane flying overhead. At first we thought it was another UFO but the location and altitude told us that it was a conventional plane. We could see that it was definitely a plane with all the characteristics that it created a beautiful sight, almost directly over our heads. About 10:15 p.m., both red objects vanished. Certain ladies are very prone to comment on these sightings and are not averse to seeking publicity - but rather unwilling to share what they have seen with others. It was a very nice interview and we are happy to present it in Probe. Thank you.
