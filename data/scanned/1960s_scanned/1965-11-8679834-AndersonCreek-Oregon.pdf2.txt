There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a page from an old UFO report document, which appears to be part of Project Blue Book. The page has instructions and diagrams related to reporting UFO sightings, including a sketch for indicating the height of an object above the horizon and a compass showing the direction of the object's movement.

TEXT OUTPUT:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
