The image contains two illustrations. The first one is a sketch showing a curved line and instructions on how to determine the height of an object above the horizon. The second illustration is a compass rose or navigation compass.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Places an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high you last saw the object. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
