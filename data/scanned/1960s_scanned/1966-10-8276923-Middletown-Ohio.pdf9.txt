The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing diagrams and instructions related to sketching and describing UFO sightings.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line that shows how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "D" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? MANY Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
