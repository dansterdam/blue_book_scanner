4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 seconds

The brief summary and analysis states that the observer noted an object that was compared to a short silver star-like object in color. The reflection of the sun off the object was described as bright. The object flew across the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge across the Hudson River. The observer had poor eyesight and still had to wear glasses, and did not have opportunity for a sustained observation. The report concludes that the object was possibly an aircraft due to the very heavy air traffic in the area at the time, but nothing unusual was observed.
