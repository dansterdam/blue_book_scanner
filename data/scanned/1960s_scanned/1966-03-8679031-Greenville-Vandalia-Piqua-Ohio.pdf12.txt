OBSERVATION OF HIGHWAY PATROLMAN - VENUS
Captain Harrell, Piqua Ohio post - Reference to UFO. They are going to develop film. Patrolman Wilson was involved in seeing the UFO. He was with other man. It was about 515 am when he went out the next morning and saw the same object, Venus. Major Quintanilla informed Patrolman Wilson we would not give his name out. Brief description of Wilson's observation follows: 1 Mile East of West Milton. Radio man (dispatcher) has a chemist degree, he thought it was the morning star. SE approximately 20 deg. 
530 - 545 am. When you stopped the patrol car the object appeared to stop and sway. This is an illusion because of the atmosphere. Planet Venus has magnitude of -4.1. It is so bright that this is common thing to report.
Captain Harrell again - Told him that it was the Planet Venus. Captain Harrell said these things get ridiculously out of hand. Dispatcher 4 took call, thought that someone was monitoring their radio. Said it wouldn't happen again.
