ATIC (DESTRT) person APB, OHIO 54433
1 August 1966

Marysville, Pennsylvania 17053

Dear [Redacted],

Our office has received numerous calls concerning the observance of a suspected unidentified flying object that was over the Dayton Area on the nights of 18 and 19 July 1966.

We were able to contact Mr. [Redacted] on the nights of 18 and 19 July. He states that he and his wife observed a bright light at approximately 11:00 p.m. on the bottom of the plane. He states it was flying a zig-zag pattern and the light would dim and then brighten. The light was at a high altitude and appeared to be stationary at times. After observing this for about 15 minutes, the light departed to the south.

I feel sure this was what you reported. There was no unusual objects reported to provide any additional information.

I wish to thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
