There is no photograph present in the image. The image shows a handwritten document filled with text.

Transcribing the text:

to go like day, (to soon enough) and a friend came down to look first for this craft and to take film pictures of its when and where it landed because the witness (he) saw to large humanoid like figures come out of this landed craft and walk around beside it, and after a short while go back into the craft which then took off straight up out of the sight in a moment.

so I wanted day this sighting with your group, and men at arms have told this and as a witness, sighting case, that could not be explained of the ordinary type and not a hoax according to men at arms and also by this witness who is a very credible person. As soon you can, please give me your opinion on this sighting case per your findings to me directly via either mail or phone when your convenience.

Also have enclosed photos as promised, but some of them have spots and marks which could not be removed with out destroying the contents of photos more.

so I am asking your group to examine these photos of this case per your best ability and give me your professional opinion.
