this, but if something does, or if you have any further thoughts, I can always be reached right simply the Dept. of Astronomy at Northwestern
University.

L	I have the address here. 
H	So if you have any further things, after we hang up, you say well, I should have told him this, or something, please jot it down, would you?
L	I'll try to think of every thing I can.
H	Good, alright now. I think that's about all I can ask about it now.
Thanks again very much.  It's been very nich talking to you.  Goodbye.
