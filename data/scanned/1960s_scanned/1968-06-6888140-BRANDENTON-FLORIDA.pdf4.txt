UFO Observations, 23 May 68 & 17 Jun 68
Bradenton, Florida 33505
1. This replies to your undated letter which we received on 25 July 1969 concerning your sightings of 23 May and 17 June 1968 at Bradenton, Florida. As you will be extremely hard to explain, you should report it to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate assessment.
2. Your sighting of 17 June 1968 appears to be very similar to a phenomena seen on this date concerning four open decays of which only have been reportedly for your observation.
3. Although your sighting occurred over thirty days ago, we are impressed with your concerning AF Form 117 and its return in the self-addressed envelope. By doing so, we will be able to include your sighting for information purposes which may be of value in evaluating other reports.
4. Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.
