The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

The day following this sighting, I contacted U.S. Weather Bureau at International Airport, and the Franklin Institute Astronomy Dept. I was told they received no reports of any unusual celestial activity on the day of the sighting.

There was a bright glow hovering over the west part of the city. She was navigation light colored. Disappeared gradually.

The object appeared over, or just east of, the store at Ninth and Market Street.

The man was below the horizon at the time of the sighting. The object was hovering about 1,000 feet high, and moved either northeast or northwest at an approximate speed of 300 mph.

The object did not rise or fall out of sight.

Unfortunately, concerning the object, no details were obtained on the day of sighting.
