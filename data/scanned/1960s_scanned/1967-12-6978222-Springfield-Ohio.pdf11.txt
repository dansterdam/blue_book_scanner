The image contains two illustrations. The first illustration is a compass rose diagram with directions labeled around the circle. The second illustration shows two landscape scenes - one with a person standing in a field, and another with a person silhouetted against a night sky.

8A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW AN ARROW SHOWING THE DIRECTION AND APPARENT MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. THIS IS SCHEMATICALLY TO SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIGZAG.
