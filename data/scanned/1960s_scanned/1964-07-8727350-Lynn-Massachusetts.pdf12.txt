Text from the document:

September 16, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in reply to your recent letter in which you detailed the observation of an Unidentified Flying Object.

Our Project Blue Book office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has reviewed the details of this observation from the details you gave. The motion and description of the object is comparable to that of a radiosonde or a rawinsonde balloon with a light.

Enclosed is a summary of information on Project Blue Book. The program for the investigation and evaluation of UFO reports. We think this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
