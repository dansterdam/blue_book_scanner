MONTE MATAO, (PROVINCE OF CORDORA) WESTERN AUSTRALIA. THE WITNESS, JAMES FERGUSON, DESCRIBED IT. IT WAS NOT AS MUCH AS SEEN AS HEARD, FOR IT HAD MADE A TERRIFIC RUSHING SOUND, RATHER LIKE THE BLAST OF A GIANT THBSHER OR DYNAMO. IT WAS NOT SEEN, THAT IS, JUST THE SOUND. THERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE BRIGHT LIGHTS THAT SHOT OFF IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS, IN DIFFERENT COLORS. THEN IT SEEMED TO FOLLOW A STRAIGHT COURSE AND THEN STOPPED DEAD. JAMES FERGUSON SAID HE COULDN'T EVEN GUESS WHAT IT WAS, BUT HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL NEVER FORGET THAT TREMENDOUS SOUND.
