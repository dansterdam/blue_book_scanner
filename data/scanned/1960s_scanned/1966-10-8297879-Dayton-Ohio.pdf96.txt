There does not appear to be any photograph or image in this scanned document page from Project Blue Book. The page contains only handwritten text responding to the questionnaire.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:      Day      Month      Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
