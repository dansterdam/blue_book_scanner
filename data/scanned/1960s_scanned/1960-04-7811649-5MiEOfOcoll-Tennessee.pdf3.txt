We atood out on the car and watched it again for a minute before I went in the house and told my wife what we were watching, thinking it to be the sun or planet. This did not seem right to us but we persuaded to do so. We watched it together for several minutes before the object, getting smaller and redder as it moved away toward the eastern horizon. I noted that by the time it could emerge on the other side it would be so far away and dim through the sky that we would be unable to see any more.

I phoned my paper about it, but the editor claimed I was seeing an aircraft. I told him that whatever it was, it had moved so fast and so silently that it surely had not been an aircraft. He asked if I'd seen a comet. I had, from Malaysia, where they had carried calls, mostly that so-called UFO phenomena had been seen and thin at the end. The tail on this object was the same all the way back until it suddenly veered off at the end. The trail that it had made had been several miles long.
