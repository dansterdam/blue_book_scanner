The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a memo routing slip with various fields, such as "ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION", "DATE", "COORDINATION", and "SIGNATURE". The text written on the slip reads "PLEASE RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE". There are also some handwritten notes at the bottom of the slip.
