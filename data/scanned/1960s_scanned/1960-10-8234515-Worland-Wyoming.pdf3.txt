"On October 4, at Cressy, Launceston, Australia, Husband and wife reported sighting a gray-white cigar-shaped object with a dull surface, which came down through a cloud cover, headed north at about 400 feet off the ground. Then out of the clouds above and behind the ship, they saw five or six small disc-shaped objects, which traveled south. Their movement was compared to 'flat stones skipping along the water'."
