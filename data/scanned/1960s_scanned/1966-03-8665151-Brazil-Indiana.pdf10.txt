Dear Sir:

I am inquiring about a sighting of an Unidentified Flying  
Object (UFO) which occurred on 24 March 1950. The object was sighted  
along side of a Piper Cub single engine aircraft at approx- 
imately two thousand feet. It was travelling in a northerly  
direction toward Indianapolis, Indiana. The object was  
approaching the Piper Cub at a high rate of speed and was  
observed for approximately thirty seconds. It was visible for thirty seconds and at the end  
of this time it seemed to speed up and vanished from sight.

There were a few clouds in the sky but all seemed to be far  
above the aircraft and the UFO. There wasn't any moon  
and the stars were not visible.

I would appreciate any information you would be able to give  
me pertaining to this sighting. If you do not have any  
information I would be most happy to file a complete report  
on this sighting. I am enclosing a sketch I made of the object.

Yours truly,
