Text from the document:

IS BODY A PICTURE HELD TO SHOW THE SHAPE AND DISTANCE OR THE UNKNOWN OBJECT, WHICH APPEARS TO BE AN AIRCRAFT LIKE OBJECT MOVING RAPIDLY THEN DISAPPEARING. NO PHOTOGRAPH SUBMITTED.

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE AND COULD A MATCH BE HELD AT ARMS LENGTH TO GET THE SEPARATION? WITNESS STATED THAT HE COULD HAVE COVERED THE OBJECT WITH HIS THUMB AT ARMS LENGTH, SO THE APPARENT SIZE WAS RATHER SMALL. IT WAS SEEN MOVING RATHER RAPIDLY, ESTIMATED IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN APPROACHING MACH 1 SPEED. IT WAS SILVER IN COLOR AND HAD BEEN SIGHTED BY SEVERAL PERSONS IN THE AREA AT THE TIME. ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE THUMB DIAMETER THIS SIGHTING WOULD HAVE COVERED AT ARMS LENGTH.
