Dear Mr.

I am writing to enclose a film slide which shows two bright lights in the sky that I observed on September 12,1960. As I reported to your office by telephone on 24 November, I am very interested in receiving your evaluation of this film slide.

I am the (name redacted) of (name redacted) who is a well known person in the Bothell, Washington area. The film slide I am enclosing was taken on September 12, 1960 at approximately 7:30 pm. As I was driving home from work, I observed two bright lights in the sky that were very unusual. I immediately pulled over and took a film slide of these lights. I have enclosed this film slide for your examination and evaluation.

I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to receiving your analysis.

Sincerely yours,
(name redacted)
