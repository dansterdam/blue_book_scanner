This report contains some very interesting data and may be indicative of airborne vehicles of some kind. The objects described do not seem to fit the description of any conventional aircraft. The witness appears to have observed the objects closely and provided a detailed account of their appearance and behavior. Although there is no photographic evidence, the narrative description is compelling and warrants further investigation.
