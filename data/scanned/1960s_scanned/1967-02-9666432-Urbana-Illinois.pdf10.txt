STATEMENT

Urbana, student, University of Illinois.

"I was walking from my dorm to the Quad around 21:00, 25 February. That's what I was a star. It appeared to have red, green and white lights. It moved very slowly and silently. It seemed to be very high up. The shape was indefinite. There was no definite shape. The lights appeared to be very close together."
