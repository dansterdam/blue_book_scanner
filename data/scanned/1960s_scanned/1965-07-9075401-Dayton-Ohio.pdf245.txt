Data you completed this questionnaire: 7 1 65
Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific police questionnaire or a normal explanation of your sighting:
This object first thought to be an ordinary airplane due to the visible lights which gave the impression of an aircraft in flight. After the object had moved more directly into sight and nearer the observer, it became apparent that the object was not an airplane. It was saucer shaped, giving off a steady bright light, neither blinking nor flashing, and moved at a very high rate of speed, much faster than any jet plane the observer had seen. The object made no sound. It went directly over observer, west to east, and disappeared. Lights went out. Bright light want out.
