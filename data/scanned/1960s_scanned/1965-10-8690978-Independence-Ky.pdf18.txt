Dear [Redacted],

Your completed form 1k contained all the necessary information and detailed the sighting. This was evaluated by the Blue Book officers.

The plan has been determined that you observed the planet Venus. Descriptions contained in your report indicate this sighting was of a celestial nature, which would place it on the southwest horizon.

Thank you for reporting your sighting to us. Your interest in our program is appreciated.

Sincerely,

GEORGE T. STONEMAN, JR.
