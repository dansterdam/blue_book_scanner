UFO SIGHTING, 11 SEPTEMBER 1965

HQ USAF SAFOICC (Mrs. Hunt)
This refers to the attached letter fr requesting information on unidentified flying objects. The following is a copy of the letter:

a. Dear Mrs. Hunt:
Your letter of 11 September 1965 has come to my attention due to the interesting and unusual nature of the sighting it describes. The information and description of the two objects appear to be very close to aircraft and they would require explanation. The sun's glint produced the impression that the objects were motionless, when in fact they were moving away from the observing point and would no longer reflected the sun's light toward you. The fact that there was more than one object simultaneously observed is very unusual and raises questions requiring explanation. 
FOR THIS COMMANDER
