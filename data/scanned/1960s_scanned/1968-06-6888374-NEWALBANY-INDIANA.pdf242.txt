The image appears to contain a questionnaire form from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The form is titled "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE" and contains various fields for the observer to provide details about the sighting, such as the date, time, location, and description of the phenomenon.

The image includes a sketch area where the observer can draw a diagram to illustrate the sighting. The sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, and an arrow pointing to a spot above the horizon, indicating the position of the observed phenomenon.
