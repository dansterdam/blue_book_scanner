The image appears to contain a page from a Project Blue Book document, but there is no photograph visible on this page. The page contains text and diagrams, which I will transcribe as an OCR system:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you saw the object high in the sky. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes (deviation) during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture to show how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
