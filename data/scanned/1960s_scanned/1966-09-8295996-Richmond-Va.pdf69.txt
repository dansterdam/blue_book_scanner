GERMAN BARIUM CLOUD EXPERIMENT LAUNCHED AT WALLOPS

A cooperative experiment between the Max Planck Institute of Munich, Germany, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was launched from Wallops Island, Va. at 5:13 a.m. EDT today.

The chemical barium and copper oxide payload was developed by a scientific team headed by Professor H. LÃ¼st, Director of the Max Planck Institute.

The big colored clouds, illuminated by the sun, were visible for hundreds of miles. A similar launch is scheduled for 5:51 a.m. EDT tomorrow morning.

Launched on a four-stage Javelin sounding rocket, the experiment ejected barium clouds at altitudes of about 257 and 570 statute miles. The artificial clouds first appeared as light green tinged with red. As they enlarged, they turned blue and formed elongated patterns, several hundred miles long, along the lines of the earth's magnetic field.
