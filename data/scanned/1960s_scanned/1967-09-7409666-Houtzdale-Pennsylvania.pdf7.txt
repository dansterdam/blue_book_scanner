My Sighting last nite record as follows:
Awoke about 3:30 am and was aware of a light outside my house, just a slight glow. Looked to the west and saw a definite craft, hovering about 300 ft. up and 1/4 mile away. It was circular in shape, about 30 ft. in diameter, and had a dull metallic finish. There was a bright dome on top.
The craft remained stationary for about 15 minutes. Then it began to move slowly and silently in a zig-zag pattern for about 5 minutes. It then stopped and remained stationary for another 10 minutes. Finally, it began to move rapidly, accelerating straight up and out of sight in a matter of seconds.
I observed it during the entire sighting, which lasted about 30 minutes. I was the only witness. The weather was clear and calm. I have no explanation for what I saw, but I am certain it was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known aircraft.
