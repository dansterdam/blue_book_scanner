There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The document appears to be primarily text describing details related to a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

This object is reported to be seen in the close vicinity of the object at the times of observation as stated in paragraph 9 of the document.

9. The witness indicates that the object is distorted in the same direction as the background, and the speed of the object is directly proportional to the time for all reactions.

10. Distortion of the man in the vertical crane is a common occurring phenomena in photography for this condition. As previously stated, the distance to the object is not known.

12. The two photographs of the sun were taken at Arcata, California (latitude 40°59'N., longitude 124°05'W.). This position astronomical coordinates was at 1:19 p.m. (local). The Array's deviation from the sun's azimuth at this time was at approximately 3° east from the true azimuth of the sun.

13. The photographs are being retained at APRO as a part of this case file.

14. Address is:
