1. At approximately 13.5 hours, 7 April 1964, I took a telephone report from a male individual who identified himself as Mr. Gordon Larscum, a Major, US Mining Corps, Retired. He further declared himself to be entirely sincere and stated observations should be made known to some proper authority, that his wife and younger daughter had observed what he believed to be a UFO over their residence, that they had reported this sighting to no one previously; since we had no more out of their feelings that people 'will think we're crazy.'

2. Mr. and Mrs. ________ , young daughter (age 13), son-in-law (Mr. ________) and married daughter (Mrs. ________) were returning from a Sunday visit.
