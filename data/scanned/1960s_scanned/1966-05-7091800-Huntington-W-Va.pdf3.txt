This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten report or letter, detailing an observation or encounter related to an unidentified flying object (UFO).

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

Dear sir,

Report of unidentified aerial vehicle sighting, May 15, 1966. At approx. 8:47pm EST I observed a bright object approximately 100 ft. in diameter hovering over an open field. The object was brightly lit and appeared to be metallic in nature. I observed the object for approximately 10 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

P.S. Because of the intensity of the light, I am certain this was not a conventional aircraft or satellite. I have never witnessed anything like this before.
