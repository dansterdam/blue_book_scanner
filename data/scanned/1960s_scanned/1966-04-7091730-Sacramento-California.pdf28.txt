ON THE NIGHT OF APRIL 7, 196 6, I contacted the newspaper people about the information which i felt was important, because of fear of ridicule and my health problems, etc. i was later requested by friends and relatives to tell and say that i did not actually observe the object since that time i have been persuaded by friends and relatives to tell and say that i did not actually observe the object since that time i have been persuaded by friends and relatives to tell and provided them a narrative i have checked the various local reports and they were not unusual at all the object which i observed was a solid object and i cannot explain what i saw i can only say i did observe something of substance was in the sky. for various reasons beyond my control, i was unable to take a photograph of the object. the person who contacted me stated that they would not like it but i am sending this report since i felt the truth was as close as possible to the facts. one sightings (about 200 feet) and at other times were as far apart as a mile or more. at times were as close as one shiplength (about 200 feet) and at other times were as far apart as a mile or more. it is a combination of fear and wonder - unlike anything i have ever experienced before. i have sincere hope that these reports will be of some help to you. Thank you for your time, etc.
