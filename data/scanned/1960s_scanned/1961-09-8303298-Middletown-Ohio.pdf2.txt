Dear Major Friend,

At 2:35 a.m. Monday Sept 18 I sighted and my wife saw what appears to have been a UFO. It was stationary at first, then moved abruptly to the North and disappeared. The object appeared to be round and grey in color and made no sound. It was directly over our house and was observed for about 3 to 4 minutes. I noted the time on my electric clock. When sighted it was about 100 ft. up and 10 feet in diameter. It appeared to be definitely under intelligent control as its movements were abrupt and erratic.

I would appreciate your comments on this sighting and any information you can give me on Project Blue Book of the Air Force.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
