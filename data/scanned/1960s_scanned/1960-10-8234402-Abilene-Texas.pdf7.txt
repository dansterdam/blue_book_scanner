The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved horizon line and an object above the horizon, with instructions to indicate the height of the object above the horizon. The second sketch shows two larger sketches depicting landscapes, with a smaller sketch in the top right corner.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text in the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are of the point shown. Please mark "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Please mark "B" at the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where it was complete to compare the change in sketch.
