UFO Observation of 3 Apr 68

1. Dr. Hynek reported this unusual UFO sighting from near Cochrane, Wisconsin. Dr. Hynek feels that this sighting should be carried as an unsolved. We would like to have your views on the sighting before we reach a final decision as to the standard. Our policy regarding UFO illuminations is that we consider the case. The observer was driving US 63 at approximately 0330 and noticed the object over the rural area SE 3.5 miles S-SE 23 c(23) which he described as a large luminous object larger than a star. There was no moonlight. The Buffalo County traffic officer who interviewed the witness after the sighting, stated that the moon was quite bright. Yet it seems unlikely that the moon would appear so orange according to the witness.
