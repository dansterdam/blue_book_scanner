Transcribing the text from the document:

When he told me, however, that just before that he had been looking at the setting discs of his telescope, illuminating them with a red light, it seemed that we might have the explanation there, as you see I have indicated in my letter to him.

So, all in all, the fuzzy edges, the greenish tinge, the faintness of the object, the irregular motion, and the fact that the witness was looking at a red light just before the incident, all point to the conclusion, it seems to me, that what he has described could have been caused by the red light over and suddenly straightened up. Anyway, I don't think we should think this up to anything really out of the ordinary, and unless he comes back with a very sharp and cogent denial, I think we might well evaluate this as a subjective experience, possibly after-images caused by watching a red light.

I'm working on the Julie, Mr. Vernon, and the _______ cases. I haven't been able to locate the Northwestern student as yet. One final thing in the case, it was he himself who brought up the suggestion that it might have been caused by the red light. Usually when the witness brings up a suggestion like that, it often means he's pretty convinced himself that that is what it was.

Sincerely,

J. Allen Hynek
