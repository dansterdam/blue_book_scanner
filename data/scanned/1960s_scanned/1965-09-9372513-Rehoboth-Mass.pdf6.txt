The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, likely containing a questionnaire or report form.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? YUS. IT DISAPPEARED BEHIND A CLOUD.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes (Circle One). IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: Cloud.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes (Circle One). IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of: Nothing.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound: None. b. Color: White and silver.
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object's diameter is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? About 1/8 inch.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details that will help identify or describe its appearance, such as wings, tail, exhaust trails, etc. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. SEE DRAWING. OBJECT WAS CIRCULAR, METALLIC, WITH A TAPERED TAIL. MOVED SLOWLY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH.
