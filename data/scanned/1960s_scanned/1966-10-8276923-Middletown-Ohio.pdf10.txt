The text in the document reads:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  OCT 10 
   Day   Month    Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Only that it would turn to the left and circle back. It was in perfect form.
