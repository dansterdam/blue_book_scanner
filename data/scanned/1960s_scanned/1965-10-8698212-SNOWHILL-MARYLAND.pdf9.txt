MEMO FOR THE RECORD

BALLOON:
1. Wallops Island, NASA, is conducting a series of tests, using blimp-like balloons in an experimental project. Balloons are manufactured by the G.T. Schjeldahl Co. (Schjell-dahl) of Northfield, Minnesota. The balloons are blimp shaped, 13.7 to 16.5 feet long, four inches in diameter, metallized mylar plastic, and the balloon has inflated fins off the tail. Balloon can drift for several hundred miles, depending on winds. Balloons have aerial numbers, and DR-Design Release Numbers. 
2. The G.T. Schjeldahl Co also manufactures another type balloon. This balloon is approximately two meters in diameter(sphere), negalazed mylar plastic, and has 3" high projection horns, spikes, reflectors for radar tracking. Used to measure wind velocity before a launch. Have supplied 1500 of these balloons to the Marshall Space Center.
