(At first I thought I saw a strange object hovering in the sky which appeared to be oval shaped and seemed to reflect light. The object was silent and seemed to remain stationary or at least make no great speed. It quickly disappeared into the distance and I could no longer see it. The night was clear with some scattered clouds. The object appeared to be a bright, shiny white in color, not pulsating and seemed to move slowly upwards and disappearing into the distance. I watched it for a period of approximately 3 minutes. There were no blinking lights or sound and it appeared to be at a high altitude. The object appeared to be silent and larger than a normal aircraft. I could not determine the exact size or make out any distinct features. It seemed to just hover silently and then quickly disappear.)

The object appeared to be close to us, approximately 1/2 mile. The object seemed to be oblong in shape and bright white in color not pulsing. It made no sound and appeared to hover silently for several minutes before disappearing into the distance. I could not determine the size or make out any distinct features. The night was clear with scattered clouds. The object did not resemble any normal aircraft, meteor or celestial object. It just appeared to hover silently before disappearing. The object appeared to travel in an upward direction at a moderate speed before disappearing from sight. I could not determine the altitude of the object.
