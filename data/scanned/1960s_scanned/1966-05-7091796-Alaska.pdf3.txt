Dear Sir:

I saw a silvery thing come out of a cloud. The strange thing about this silvery thing is we were watching it and it seemed to be stationary in the air. We watched it for about five minutes and then it went straight up and out of the ground. We watched it do this several times. It was almost like a television the other night. I was about flying saucers. We thought it was a satellite at first but we are sure it was not.

If you want to write to me here is my address:

Sincerely yours,
