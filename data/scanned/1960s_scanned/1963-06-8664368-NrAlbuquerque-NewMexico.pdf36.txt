Unsolved
U.S. Air Force (Project Blue Book) has investigated over 12,000 reports of unidentified flying objects. 663 are listed as "Unknown". 
Some reports like this from Albuquerque, New Mexico, June 8, 1963, show that objective evidence is lacking - no photographs, no physical evidence, no independent witnesses. The only photographs that have been obtained are hoaxes according to Air Force analysis.
