TO DO
I feel "unspeakable" was a poor word to use as a description, as I would not feel comfortable speaking those words. I would feel sad, and think of the implications of such a word.  

In this case, the witnessed event seems very unusual, and I can understand the witness feeling at a loss for how to describe it. The witness provides many details about the object, its movement, and what was experienced. While the language used is strong, I think the witness is simply trying to convey the profound nature of what they witnessed.

Some key details from the text:
- The event occurred on 8/6/1945 (likely a typo for 1965)
- The object was described as about 75-80 feet in diameter
- It hovered at an altitude of about 800 feet
- It moved in an accelerated, erratic pattern, seeming to defy gravity
- It made no sound and gave off no exhaust or vapor trail
- The witness felt a sense of dread and unease observing the object

Overall, this appears to be a detailed firsthand account of an unusual aerial phenomenon witnessed by the author. While the language used is strong, the witness seems to be trying to convey the extraordinary nature of what they saw.
