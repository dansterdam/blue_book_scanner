The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

What might be very bright round blinking on and off slowly that could be seen through the trees and could not know what it was up to this time but that of a unknown aircraft maneauvering for about one hour or a little longer. And did sit of several causes, but they were few and not know where they really stand to a full conclusion type.

Ever (2-) 
As if the woods had a whitish house, great part of the mill of the hill, the report where we are standing.
