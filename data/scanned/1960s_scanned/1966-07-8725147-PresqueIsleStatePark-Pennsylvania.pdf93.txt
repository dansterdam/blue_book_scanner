MEMOS FOR THE RECORD

At 0130, 1 August 1966 Lt Marley was notified by SSgt Jones, of Tdi, that the Duty Officer had information on an important sighting in Pennsylvania that took place in a public park. The police wanted to know if the type of thing the Duty Officer and others felt that the object appeared as a light and stayed there for 45 minutes, so there would be no need for roping off the area. Duty Officer was Captain.

At 0745, 1 August, Lt Marley received a telephone call from Major Youngstown Airport, 513-360, that was a call to SSgt autovan. Youngstown had been advised by Captain O'Brian. Major Wall didn't know anything about the sighting in Pennsylvania. They are manned by civilian guards over the weekends only; it was those guards that gave the number of Wright-Patterson reports to the Police in Pennsylvania. Lt Marley said he would contact Youngstown.

Talked to Sgt Heckenshaw with the State Police, Pennsylvania, and the State Police said that the lighting had been brought to their attention and people were stuck in the sand and they saw this bright shiny object. Later they saw it land and then later they saw a black monster in the area. Sgt Heckenshaw at this point mentioned that it was possible that it was some kind of hoax or prank that took over at this time.

Lt Marley spoke with Chief of Park Police Dan Descania, 814 833-6132, who said that statements from the people. Descania had talked with Captain O'Brian and said not to rope the area off. A search of the area commenced at 9 am.
