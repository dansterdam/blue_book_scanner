L          did it go . . . ?
L          No, it went toward that farm house and it was going up the field, you know and it stopped.  It just went real smooth and it didn't hesitate
and it didn't jerk and it went straight over.
H          How long did it take to disappear?
L          It didn't right away.  I finally - then when it left, then the car sort
of jerked.  It turned over it went ur-urur and then finally it turned
over real good and I finally got the car started.
H          That is, you were using the starter?
L          Yes, I was using it.  And it went over there above[ the field, and then
as soon as I got the car started, then it started to come back toward.
me again, like it was teasing me or something, and by that time I had
floored the car and I gotten up to Cochran by the time there and the
high way is lighted, so then it just gradually went back again, and I
saw it crossing the railroad tracks and then I looked down the railroad
tracks toward that field there and it was just going slowly down.
H          You didn't hear any reports from any witnesses, or any other people 
around there?  Of course, people often don't talk about this.  This is
the trouble. 
L          Yes.-- There's a lady in Cochran that saw something like this come from
that same direction one man morning, because I talked to her sister and
I mentioned this about my - you know - and she told me her sister had
seen something but she won't talk to anybody because she said, people'd
figure she was crazy. 
H          Yes.  This is of course a problem I run into time and again, and it's a
rough one.  Now, I also want to know - we haven't talked about sizes.
