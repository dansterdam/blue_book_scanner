The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with a series of questions related to the observation of an unidentified object.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Please use an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "Y" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know more about the apparent size of the object. First, its apparent length in line with a known object and note of the sighting; how much of the object was covered by the head of the match. If you find yourself unable to make this experiment at the time, please indicate so.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a comparison object or objects which, when added up in the way, would give the same appearance as the object which you observed.
