11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object moved from North to South in sight for 30-60 seconds. Object appeared rounded, disc-like and oscillated up and down. Object disappeared. Picture of object (drawing) included with report. COMMENTS: The report does not accord with duration. Likely that this is the result of a natural phenomenon and not an unusual aerial object. As no physical evidence is available, this case can not be stated of further evaluation. This case was reviewed in November 1964.
