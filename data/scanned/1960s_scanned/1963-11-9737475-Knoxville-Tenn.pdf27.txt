The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a letter from the United States Air Force with the date of October 21, 1963.

The text in the letter is as follows:

Department of the Air Force
Directorate of Information
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sir:

I have some questions I would like answered:

(1) Why is the truth about flying saucers being hidden? I have a right to know. Congressional hearings will reveal information.

Please send me all information on saucers available to the public. Facts about sightings, photos, and other sheets. What is your excuse for withholding orders.

(3) I read that the U.S. Air Force has not witnessed a flying saucer since January 1, 1949. As a result, extensive searches have made some say that a grandiose hoax has been perpetuated on the free world.

Sincerely yours,
