This was the text contained in the document:

in time, using one day, once, so that this might never have. happened. I do not know
 why I was awakened at that time, but it was surely an unusual experience. I have never
 had anything like this happen to me before. The time was about 3:15 AM, August 8. I
 was awakened by a sound, as if something heavy had struck the side of the house. The
 sound was not like a crash, but more of a reverberating thud, with no aftereffect. I im-
mediately went to the living room window and looked out, but I could see nothing unusual
 in the yard or on the street. I did not hear the dogs barking or any other sound that 
might have caused the disturbance. My wife slept on, unaware of the incident.

Going out of the house, I found nothing unusual in the area. The grass and shrubbery were
 all undisturbed. When daylight came, there was still no evidence of any type of landing 
or impact in the yard. During the day I talked with neighbors who live nearby, but no one
 else had heard or seen anything unusual that night.  

I am puzzled by the experience and can offer no explanation for the unusual sound that
 awakened me. It was not like anything I have ever heard before. As I look back on it, I 
wonder if it could have been some type of aerial phenomenon. However, I saw no lights 
or other indications of an aircraft in the area. I can only report what I experienced -
 the sound that awakened me and the lack of any evidence afterwards. I have no other
 information to add to this report. The incident remains a mystery to me.
