Dear Dr. Hynek:

Thank you for your letter of inquiry concerning the 1000 lb. piece of metal being held by the Canadian Government which is believed to have come from a crashed UFO. This metal was cut through the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book and Air Technical Intelligence for me from a larger piece in my possession. The original 1000 lb. piece was given to the Canadian Government, and 1/12 feet thick is now on display.

I also have photographs showing the conditions under which the metal was found during the latter part of 1960 on the north of Quebec City on the edge of the St. Lawrence River. This information is also available at the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book.

I am enclosing a copy of the complete analysis made by John F. Royland, for Scientific Chemistry Section, Mineral Sciences Division, Mines Branch, Department of Mines and Technical Surveys, Canada, using X-ray diffraction and spectrographic analysis. He concluded it is not ordinary high-manganese steel. He concluded the material is of extraterrestrial rather than terrestrial origin.

The effects by John Fuller in the May 14 issue of Look Magazine were very comprehensive and I feel satisfied they will be a serious setback to the study of the UFO phenomena if their approach permits too much skepticism to obscure some of the convincing and impressive facts. I hope some of the articles in this issue will contribute to an increased university and scientific interest in the phenomena, which has been lacking.
