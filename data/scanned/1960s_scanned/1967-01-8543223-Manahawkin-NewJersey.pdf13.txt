Dear Sir:

Last evening, between 10:15 and 10:20 P.M., as we were driving north on Route 9 toward Manahawkin, we saw a very strange sight in the sky about 20 miles south of us.

At the time we (my husband and I) sighted the brilliant object, which looked to be quite around, we were a short distance south of the Manahawkin intersection, i.e. Routes 9 and 72. When we stopped the car and got out, the object was confirmed to be quite large and was moving. We were amazed at the brilliancy of the light which appeared to be emanating from its southern or southeasterly by easterly direction. As we watched it disappeared in a downward motion simply vanishing.

We are certain the object was not a plane or meteorite. The object was moving parallel to the earth and traveled straight as a die from the northwest to the southeast. And as I said before, the speed was fantastic.

This morning I called the Coast Guard, but they knew of no special Coast Guard nor Navy activity in this area. I have also written to the U.S.O.O. in Atlantic City to ascertain what they may know.

Please advise me if the Air Force or U.S.O.O. and anything further in this location. Also, please inform me of the name and address of the special Bureau which has been set up to study U.F.O.

Thank you for your attention to my requests and for your reply as soon as possible.

Yours truly,
[Signature]"
