"SEEN BY FIVE" was flying "most was" in the Port Washington area on August 12th. The sighting was relayed to Edward Lindmier, Director of the Milwaukee Astronomical Observatory, who with several assistants observed the object. The object appeared to be a self-luminous mass. It moved rapidly back and forth "in an east-west line", and then hovered, "moved rapidly around in a circle for a half hour."
