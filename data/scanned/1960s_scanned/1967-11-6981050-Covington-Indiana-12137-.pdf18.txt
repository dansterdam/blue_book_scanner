The image appears to be a black and white photograph. It shows a grainy, blurred image with some indistinct shapes and patterns. There does not appear to be a human face or any identifiable subjects in the photograph.

COVINGTON, INDIANA

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY:

On 6 November 1967, four persons reported sighting an unidentified flying object over Covington, Indiana. A photograph was taken of the object, and this photograph is included with the report.

The four eyewitnesses, who wish to remain anonymous, stated that the object was round in shape, silver in color, and appeared to be approximately 60 to 80 feet in diameter. The object was observed hovering at an estimated altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet above the ground for approximately 15 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.

The photograph submitted with the report shows an indistinct, blurred image which appears to be consistent with the eyewitness descriptions. However, due to the poor quality of the photograph, no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the nature or identity of the observed object.

This report has been reviewed and filed as part of Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's historical program for the investigation of unidentified flying objects.
