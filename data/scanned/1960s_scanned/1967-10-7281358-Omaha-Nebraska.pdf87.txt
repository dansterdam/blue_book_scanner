The image appears to be a handwritten document with no photographs present. As an OCR system, I will now extract all the text from the document:

The object was observed as a bright light from the west. It appeared to be flying, and as it approached the witness, it had a definite outline and was traveling at a high rate of speed. The light was quite bright, and was the size of a movie screen when it was closest. The light was observed for about 5 minutes and then disappeared over the horizon. 

The witness was driving a car at the time and was approximately 30 miles west of Omaha, Nebraska. The time of the observation was 7:10 p.m. on October 7, 1967.
