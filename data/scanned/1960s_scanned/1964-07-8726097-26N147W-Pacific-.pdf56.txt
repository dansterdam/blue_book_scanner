TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

DEAR LANDINGS
IN ABOUT 1958, TWO MEN WERE IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY, ONE NIGHT NEAR ELEVENTH AND MARKET STREETS, AND THEY SAID A CIRCULAR OBJECT WITH A LANDING GEAR SEEMED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS ON THE STREETS FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME. THEY ALSO DESCRIBED IT AS HAVING BRIGHT LIGHTS AROUND IT AND BEING SILVER IN COLOR. THEY CLAIMED THEY WENT OVER AND TOUCHED IT AND THEN A MAN ALLEGEDLY APPROACHED THEM AND TOLD THEM NOT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS. THEY ALSO SAID THEY DID NOT REPORT THIS TO ANY NEWSPAPERS. OUR INFORMANT WAS TOLD THAT THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED ABOUT 5 OR 6 YEARS AGO.
