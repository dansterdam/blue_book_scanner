SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: PTD (CDE)
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

1. The attached UFO report was given to the Rhein-Main Base Operations Officer on 19 July 1965. The source is a Federal Aviation Agency flight inspector. He could not identify the object. The total flight was observed.

2. Major xxxxxxxxx of this Detachment talked to him by telephone at his home. There was very little that could be added to the written-up description. The aircraft was under radar control but radar did not see the object. The other pilot was not notified in time to see it and the control was not in the area at the time.

3. Since so much time had lapsed since the sighting it was decided not to transmit the report by electrical means.

4. Further information can be collected from the source of this information should FDID desire further coverage.
