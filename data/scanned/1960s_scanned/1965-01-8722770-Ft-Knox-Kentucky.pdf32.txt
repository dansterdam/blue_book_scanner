Dear Sirs:
On Jan, 10, 1965, at approximately 10:05 P. M. I witnessed a strange object in the night sky while driving home from work. This object was triangular in shape and appeared to be stationary, except that it was oscillating slightly and moving rapidly from side to side. 
The object was lit up brilliantly on the underside, and on the topside the lights were very dim. It did not blink. It made a slight "whining noise" - no other sound. The estimated altitude was about 1,000 feet, and the distance was approximately 1 mile away. 
For about 3 to 5 seconds, the speed of the object was very slow, then it accelerated tremendously and was out of sight in a matter of seconds, leaving no trail.
The brilliant lights shining down made me think at first that it might be a helicopter, but it was moving in a very unnatural way and was too high and too fast for a helicopter.
I would appreciate any information you could give me concerning this incident.
Sincerely,
