Sirs, I am sorry that I am not writing this because of all the exciting sightings of flying objects that have taken place only because it disturbs me no end to have to do it. I wonder if there is any way to prove just what I saw without any fear of ridicule.

I live in Sauk Centre, Minnesota. I would like to state just what I saw without any further comments. On the west and of town, I drove out to the west side of town to see if there was anything at the new road construction. I saw a large object hovering above the ground about 150 feet up. It was circular in shape and about 75 to 100 feet in diameter. It had a large light on the bottom which was brightly lit and seemed to be changing colors, white, green and red. There was no sound coming from it. I watched it for about 15 minutes from a distance of 500 feet or more. There were no other planes in the sky. I had a pair of 7x50 binoculars with me and I could see the object very clearly. Suddenly it disappeared immediately and the other one was in sight for only a few seconds. I rushed back to town thinking there must be some explanation, but I could find none. A few weeks later I was at the local airport to see if there were any planes in the area and to trouble me more, there were no planes in the area and nothing that could be moving like the object I had seen before.

I am puzzled and worried about this experience and I would like to know if there is any way it can be explained without being ridiculed. I am a sane, intelligent person, 43 years of age and I know what I saw. There is no doubt about it in my mind. Would appreciate hearing from you.

Very truly yours,
