The text in the document reads as follows:

Dear sir:
Your investigation of our sighting of August 18 - 19 at 10:00 p.m. while camping on the Stokes State Forest, Sussex County, indicates the possibility of the flight path not being visible to ground observation, due to unusual atmospheric conditions affecting the perception of the observers. It may not be of scientific interest but is worthy of record as it illustrates the difficulties involved in adequate ground observation of such phenomena. Only under the most favorable atmospheric conditions would it have been possible to determine the true nature of the object or its point of origin or termination.

Yours truly,
