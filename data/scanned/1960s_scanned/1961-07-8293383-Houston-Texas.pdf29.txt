a very strange object, that it very silently and slowly moved off towards the west. He said it was a ball of light about the size of a basketball, and that it seemed to be rotating slowly as it moved. He said it was very bright, putting out a reddish-orange glow, and that it made no sound at all as it moved. He said it appeared to be about 500 feet up in the air, and that it moved off slowly and silently, disappearing from sight within a couple of minutes.
