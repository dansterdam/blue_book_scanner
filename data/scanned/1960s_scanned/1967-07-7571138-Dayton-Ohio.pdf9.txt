Dear Sirs:

This is in regard to the investigation of the unidentified flying object sighted by you at approximately 10:15 p.m., September 7, 1967, in the Dayton, Ohio area.

We appreciate your cooperation in providing us with the details of your observation. The information has been carefully reviewed and evaluated by our staff of scientific consultants.

Based on the data submitted, the object you observed was most likely a meteor or piece of space debris re-entering the earth's atmosphere. Such phenomena can sometimes appear as stationary or slow-moving objects, due to the great distances involved, and the angle of observation.

While we understand the natural human curiosity regarding unusual sky events, we hope this explanation helps provide a plausible, natural explanation for what you witnessed. Please let us know if you have any other questions.

Very truly yours,
PROJECT BLUE BOOK
