Dear Mrs. [redacted],

We have completed our investigation of your unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting in August 1966. A study of the subjective information submitted did not reveal the actual stimulus for your observation. Due to the late receipt of the information, it is not possible at this time to make a comprehensive investigation of air activity since records are normally destroyed three months after their utilization. In addition, the lack of a specific date prevents a meaningful check of satellite schedules.

No direct correlation can be established between the buzzing sound and the observance of the alleged UFO. We are not in a position to advise you on shooting a UFO; however, it would be wise to consult law enforcement officers before taking such action. It should be pointed out that many UFOs have been determined to be airplanes and there is a federal law against firing at them.

Sincerely,
