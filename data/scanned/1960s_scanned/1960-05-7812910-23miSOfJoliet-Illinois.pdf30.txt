"SUBJECT: TITAN MISSILE FIRING ACCIDENT
SAFOP-30/Major Hart/kd/7930
20 April 1962
Dear [Redacted],

A check of the files for 13 May 1960, as per your request, discloses the TITAN missile was fired at 2052 and contact was lost after about 200 miles. This accident appears to be unrelated to course altitudes. As there are some questions on this aspect, we have no information on course altitudes.

Although we receive a number of Brazilian sighting reports, our files contain none for 13 May 1960.

Sincerely,
G. E. HART
Major, USAF
Assistant Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
Office of Information Services"
