Atch #6). Mr. ______ judgement and reliability were high. There were no other reported sightings of this object. The distance from the observors to the object, which was reported to be at about 6000 feet, made it unable to estimate the size or identity of this object. 

On 15 January 1961 and other employees of KXXX-TV, Altus, Oklahoma, sighted an object approximately 1/2 mile SE of Altus AFB. Mr. _____, on the south edge of the Altus AFB, is a newsman and controls the TV cameras and other equipment of KXXX-TV. He and several others sighted the object on 14 January (see Atch #2), except that it is difficult to determine the size and altitude of this object.
