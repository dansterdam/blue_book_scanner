The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a sketch or diagram showing the viewing angles and movement of an unidentified object, as well as some text instructions and a handwritten response.

TEXT CONTENT:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
A sketch is included.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
Some handwritten text indicates there was more than one object that moved together.
