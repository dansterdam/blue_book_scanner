The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document describing a UFO sighting report.

Text from the document:

I received a call from Major Horkans, USAF. Command Post, advising me to be prepared for a recovery operation soon. At 2300 hrs AFIX Command Post called and advised me that May Brown, Rahall Air Defense Sector, AO 2816, Ex 741, called and reported seeing nine objects described as round, glowing reddish orange, larger than a dime in size, traveling in a diagonal and parallel direction from Ohio Indiana Michigan and Pennsylvania. 
The time of sighting was 4:35 PM.
Some reports stated that the object was large and cigarshape 

A call was received from Mr. [redacted], Dayton, Michigan reporting something he watched for a while longer than he was accustomed to observing in the sky. He was advised to report this through military channels as this may involve something that needs further investigation and pick-up on his object that started a fire.

Two calls have been received from the same party. Both have been referred to the weather station. Apparently the nature of the calls indicates they are of a nebulous nature.
