The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn schematic diagram and text. The schematic diagram appears to show the motion of an observed object, with labels indicating the object was "sighted in the northeast, moved due south, and disappeared moving due east". The text below states that "ONE ONLY" object was observed.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please draw on the curved line to show how the object was moving from the horizon (skyline) Place a "+" on the line to show where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the line to show where you last saw it. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
OBJECT WAS SIGHTED IN THE NORTHEAST, MOVED DUE SOUTH, PAUSED AND DISAPPEARED MOVING DUE EAST

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there? ONE ONLY
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
