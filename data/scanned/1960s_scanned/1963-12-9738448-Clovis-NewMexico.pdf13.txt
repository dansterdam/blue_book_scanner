SUBJECT: FLYING SAUCER INCIDENT - AUG 64

Air Force Intelligence Officers investigated a report of unidentified flying objects over Northern California, unable to explain why hundreds of people on the ground could see them while Air Force pilots could not. There was widespread interest in the sightings, because it occurred coincidentally with the flight of spacecraft Venus. A spokesman at Hamilton Air Force Base said that a report from the Sheriff's office at Clovis, California, described a large unidentified flying object "constantly changing back and forth and changing colors" in the sky over Clovis. The Air Force was immediately alerted, and in turn called the State Civil Defense. At the same time the Federal Aviation Administration Tower at Oakland directed all civilian aircraft in the area to be on the alert for UFO or unidentified craft. Pilots flying in the area could see lights but were unable to make positive contact. Radar was also unable to pick up the object. Twenty minutes later, a second report came that the UFO was back and now circling the Greenfield-Salinas area. A supersonic jet interceptor was being considered, the UFO suddenly climbed straight up and disappeared. As the unidentified spokesman said, "twenty minutes after the initial report was made at 5:20 it also came from the Sheriff's Office, saying the object had returned for the third time." This morning's newspaper carried the largest UFO sighting in recent years, which was reported in the "CITIZEN NEWS", DECEMBER 13, 1963, HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA. Warrant Officer Ernest Fournoy Jr., where stationed in Wernich Germany, tracked the signals of the UFO. Pa, 19149.
