The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a series of questions.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path or "B" on the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and estimate how much of the object is covered by the match. If you had performed this comparison, how much of the object would have been covered by the match?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words which, when placed in the sky, would give the same appearance.
