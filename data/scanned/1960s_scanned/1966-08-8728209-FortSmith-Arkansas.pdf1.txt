BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observation in the sky (red, green, and white in color), occasionally blinking, and twinkling. Some of the lights moved in a southerly direction, others did not move. None of any unusual objects were reported by the FAA. One of these objects appeared to have a vapor trail and disappeared. No noises were heard by the observers. Several people were watching these objects in the sky at the time.
At HQ - Intensity studies made. Radar and visual confirmed. "The object track then follows that of two known aircraft that were operating in the area. The object could be a satellite or space debris or any high intensity lights from aircraft passing overhead."
