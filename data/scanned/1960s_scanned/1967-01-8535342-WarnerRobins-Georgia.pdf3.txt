Gentlemen:

On the evening of January 13, 1967, I telephoned your office regarding several matters I mentioned that I had observed strange-looking objects in the verbal report I made to your office on January 13, 1967. I was informed that such reports are filed and no further action is taken on these unless some special circumstances were involved.

Because of my curiosity about the object's proximity to the power plant, I am enclosing a report I made concerning this observation. As soon as the object was discovered, measures were taken to determine from the power plant operators whether they had noticed anything unusual at that point.

You will notice in the enclosing (from the January 26, 1967, report) that the Lawrenceburg sub-station of the power company had discovered a power failure at the time the object was sighted and was investigating the cause.

You will notice, too, that one witness described the object as oscillating or pulsating at several points on its surface. This behavior seemed similar to the description of the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, object that made the news some time later.

Several other reports, similar to the one I am enclosing, have come to my attention during the past week, and one of those suggests a similar object traveling at high speed and observing my report. The proximity of the object to the power plant is a striking circumstance, and I think, and I felt you would be interested in the additional information.

Sincerely,
