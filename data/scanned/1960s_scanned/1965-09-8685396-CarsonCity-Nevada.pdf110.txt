Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star?

Experts have been examining the phenomena which they state are strange, meteors and unusual atmospheric conditions observed by pilots and others.

On March 8, L. S. Montebanito, USAF maintenance controller, reported that air force pilots in the area had spotted the objects and reacted that the objects turned out to be stationary but which turned out to be unusually bright stars.

The lights were reported over a period of several minutes to observers in Carson City, Nevada.

L. Eugene Cuscino, Jr., a technician, used binoculars and observed the objects for several minutes.

The objects turned out to be stars, brighter than normal, in full daylight.

In a statement also pointed out that similar reports of unusual lights in the sky had been common in the past and were generally found to be stars or planets appearing unusually bright.
