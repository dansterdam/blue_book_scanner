Dear Mr. Hall:

Enclosed is my report on the Unidentified Objects. I am not able to send the photos, because I originally school gets these and no longer has them.
I hope you will understand that, though my friends are using their labs, I will have one of my friends make some for me and send them.

It is quite aware that you are not one of the officials concerned with this case. It is apparent that you have a genuine interest in the UFO subjects. I hope that you will pass these objects that I have contacted on to officials who may want them. I understand the reluctance of some groups that have studied these and not released any findings. However, I believe that the science of this phenomenon will be advanced in the long run by an open exchange of information.

I am enclosing copies of my findings and would appreciate your comments and suggestions. I am hoping to be of service in obtaining documentation which can withstand scientific scrutiny.

Sincerely yours,
