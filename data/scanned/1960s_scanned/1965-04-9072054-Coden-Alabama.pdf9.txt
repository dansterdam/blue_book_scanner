Mrs Hunt/SAFOXCC/TLBH4/10 Jun 65

Dear Mr. 

Your letter to the Secretary of Defense in which you requested an investigation of an unidentified flying object sighting has been referred to this office for reply.

We appreciate your interest and cooperation in reporting this incident. However, we are unable to undertake an investigation of this particular incident as it does not meet the criteria for a formal project Blue Book investigation. We are, therefore, filing your report in our records and returning it to you with our thanks.

Sincerely,

Lt. Col. 
PID Form 164
Mr. 
Cooden, Ala.
