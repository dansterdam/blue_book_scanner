11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers were two white males. They witnesses said that there was some motion. The object disappeared toward the north. An aircraft was the probable conclusion, and was seen by the witnesses. There were no records to indicate that an aircraft was in the area, and consideration of the existing weather conditions appears that the course of the object was the plane sighted.
