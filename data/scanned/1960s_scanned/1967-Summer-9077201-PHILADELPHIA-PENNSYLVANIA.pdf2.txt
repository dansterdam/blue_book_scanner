June 16, 1965

Dear Sir,

About your case #9077201 of a sighting under investigation: This data report form with details of the sighting was received on 7/26/67. While I'm glad that the details of the sighting are available, I'm afraid that without the photographic evidence referred to, the case cannot be considered as fully documented at this time.

We always urge observers to attempt to photograph any unidentified aerial objects they may sight, since such photographic evidence is often the only way by which an adequate scientific evaluation can be made. Since your observer apparently did take some photographs, it would be most helpful if you could obtain copies of these and forward them to us for detailed analysis.

I realize that the case is a very old one, and there may be some difficulty in locating the photographic material. However, if it can be located and forwarded, it would enable us to reopen the investigation and perhaps reach a more definitive conclusion.

Please let me know if you are able to obtain the photographic evidence, and we will promptly initiate a re-examination of the case.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
