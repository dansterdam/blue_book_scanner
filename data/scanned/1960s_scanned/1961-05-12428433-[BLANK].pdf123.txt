The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Mercury document, likely an operations manual or report. The text on the page describes the operations and procedures related to the Mercury capsules, including details about the preflight checkout, launch, and recovery processes.

PROJECT MERCURY
Commands can be issued from the station since emergency situations can be contained on the tapes. Each station has its own tape. The station's tape is played to the capsule to check the capsule's operation. Commands from the ground such as switching to the secondary system, switching to short, an entire three-orbit mission can be initiated on the network without ever actually launching a mission. It is to be further noted that the station dynamic tests and, thus, have capsule, atmospheric, and network tested together in the final way. The missions will ultimately be passively conducted and logged on tape. Subsystem and station static tests are now being accomplished.

OPERATIONS
Hangar checkout of capsules
The Mercury capsules are airlifted from the McDonnell plant at St. Louis, Missouri, to Cape Canaveral, Fla. A team of the capsule arrives at the Cape Canaveral airstrip, it is trucked to the NASA capsule checkout area in Hangar S. A preliminary checkout of the capsule receives a primary systems checkout at the factory; the final detailed systems checkout is accomplished in the capsule checkout area. This checkout includes: (1) the d.c. and a.c. electrical systems; (2) the sequential systems which control all the capsule events from launch through capsule separation, tower jettison, capsule attitude, and recovery system; (3) the high frequency and ultrahigh frequency radios, command receivers, and telemetry transmitters; and (4) the automatic stabilization and control systems for the horizon scanners, gyro-erection and precision, relays and logic circuits. The capsule then undergoes a simulated flight checkout within the capsule systems.
