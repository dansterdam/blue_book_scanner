The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book report, with a survey form filled out. The form contains questions about the observed object, such as whether it disappeared while being watched, whether it moved behind something, its color, and the observer's estimate of its size.

14. Rea di the objec disce a red while you were watching it? If so, how?
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED WHILE OBSERVING 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)  
YES    NO    Don't Know
(If you answered YES, then tell what:)

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)

(If you answered YES, then tell what:)

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound ABSOLUTELY SILENT
b. Color WHITISH SILVER

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
2-3 DEGREES

19. Draw a picture that (1) show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
