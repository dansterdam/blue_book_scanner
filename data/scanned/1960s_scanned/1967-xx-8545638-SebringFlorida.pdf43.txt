"Glowing Object Trailed Car,
North Adams Trio Reports"

A shining object, which the witnesses described as "glowing" 
was sighted from a car Saturday night near Williamstown, 
Mass. The incident was reported by three North Adams residents.

The other thing, according to the report, was that the object 
appeared to be about seven to eight feet tall. It was shaped like 
an elongated oval and had a glowing, silvery color. The object 
was first sighted on the ground about 500 feet away from the car 
and then paced the car for a while, staying about the same 
distance away.

The report states that the object seemed to be "following" the
car. It disappeared after a short time but reappeared again 
about 50 seconds later. The object was then about 200 feet 
away and about 10 feet off the ground. It disappeared again after 
a few seconds.

The witnesses were two college students, one of whom is a 
student at North Adams State College, and a third companion. 
They were returning to North Adams from Williamstown when the
incident occurred around 10 p.m. Saturday. The sighting was 
"very bright", they said, and the object seemed to be about seven
or eight feet tall and ovally-shaped.

Joseph Dente, a student at Williams College, said he and two 
companions saw the object on the hill on their way back to North 
Adams. Dente said the object was "very bright" and appeared to 
be following their car. He said it disappeared and then reappeared
several times. Dente said the sighting was "very unusual" and the 
object was about 500 feet away at one point.

The Pittsfield Police Department, which received the report, said 
no explanation has been found for the incident.
