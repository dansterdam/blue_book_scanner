The image contains a photograph depicting the scene described in the text. The photograph shows a small object or craft hovering off the ground, with the witness Zamora in the distance observing it. There are no human faces visible in the photograph.

From all of the above and from my personal observations, I would conclude the following: That Zamora, although not overly bright or articulate, is basically sincere, honest, and reliable. He would not be capable of concluding a complex hoax, nor would his temperament indicate that he was simply a crank on duty, relinquished one discharge of that duty (chasing a speeding car) for another which he thought was more immediate importance. (Investigating the possible explosion of a dynamite shack). His fright was genuine.
