A LIGHT BROWN COLORED OBJECT WAS REPORTED BY LARRY MOYERS, OF FSIG. HIS MOTHER AND FATHER WERE ALSO WITNESSES. 
MOYERS SAID THE OBJECT LOOKED TO BE 
CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND HOVERED FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES BEFORE SPEEDING OUT OF SIGHT. 
REACTION: TWO WOMEN VERIFIED THIS SIGHTING OF THE OBJECT EARLIER. THEIR SIGHTING WAS SIMILAR.
OBJECT: TWO SHAPED, BRIGHT LIGHTS FLASHED WHITE AND RED COLORS. TWO HOURS LATER TWO PERSONS DRIVING A HUGE LIGHTED GREEN FIREBALL WITH A TAIL. FELL AT A STEEP ANGLE IN A SOMEWHAT ERRATIC DIRECTION OUT OF SIGHT AND DIDN'T DIE OUT UNTIL IT WAS AT TREE-TOP LEVEL. DESCRIPTION: THE CLEAR SKIES AND THE FLASHING LIGHTS, THAT BRILLIANT BLUISH STAR IN THE SKIES, COULD ONLY COMPARE TO THE MANY SIGHTS OF UFO'S REPORTED IN THIS AREA.
