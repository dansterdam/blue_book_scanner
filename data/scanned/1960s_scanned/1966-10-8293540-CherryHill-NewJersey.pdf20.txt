along each side. These windows , when the ship is parked or hovering, or in flight approx. 50 mph land speed in our atmosphere are still amber in color. The nose of the ship is like a large beacon which contains the inside front cowl' s, and passengers as a white light, from which could be seen that a radar type probe aerial, protruding from the cone, would direct through some internal survey controls. From which the only thing that could be determined was when this object was connected to a line or a cable which was in contact with the R G A roof' in the yards of one of the large tripped buildings, which extended 20 to 30 feet above the roof. There are several pulsating or blinking lights on the top edge of the ship from front to back. They are bright beacon type lamps, which appear to be used for navigation or flight clearance lights. The brilliant shifting or flashing light within the ship is only visible or on, when the ship is in flight, not while hovering or landed, as far as we saw it. There was no landing gear or curved bottom part of the ship which resembles an exit or entrance way, what looked like a cable type ladder to the foot of the R G A building, which could not be reached.
We parked there for 10 min. then moved to the entrance of the Cherry Hill base, still on the project, where the observation continued. We vacated the area, because we felt we might be observed.
We are still puzzled about this astonishing aircraft, that we witnessed. It would like to have our experience published, but we do not want to violate U.S. and R G A are working on, then we would refrain from any conversation about the subject. If on the other hand we could have your permission to publish this story, we would appreciate any information you would care to volunteer.
