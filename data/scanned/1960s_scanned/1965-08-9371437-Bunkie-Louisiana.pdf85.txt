The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a drawing or sketch. The drawing appears to be a diagram or illustration with instructions for the viewer, including a compass rose and instructions to draw the motion of an object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the object you first saw above the horizon (6/5 line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where you lost sight of it. Place an "X" on the compass at the point where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
