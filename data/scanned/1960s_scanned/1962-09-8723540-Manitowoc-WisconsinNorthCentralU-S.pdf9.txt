The image does not contain a photograph, but rather sketches or illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" on the horizon, and instructions to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second and third sketches show larger views of the object's position, with instructions to indicate where the object was in relation to the observer's position when it was first seen.

Here is the text output from the document:
