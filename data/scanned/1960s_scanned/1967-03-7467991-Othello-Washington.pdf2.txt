The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions related to a UFO sighting report. The diagram shows a compass-like illustration with directions and angles labeled, along with instructions for the observer to indicate the position of the UFO sighting relative to the compass and horizon.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to indicate where you first saw the object. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
