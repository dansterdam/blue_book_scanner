There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? The object disappeared without a change in appearance.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? YES. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: It moved behind a cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? NO. Don't Know. 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: 
a. Sound did not hear anything 
b. Color white 
c. Size about the size of a quarter held at arm's length

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how many match heads would have covered the object? 3-4 match heads

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object not you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially without trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. (The sketch is included in the image.)
