AF IN: 54901

DIVISION GUARDIANS SAID UFO WAS 7-8 YARDS LONG. THIS IS POSSIBLE TO REALLY BE SMALL AS US RADAR SITES IN AREA TO SOUTH WERE ALERTED, AND AT 2700152A AIRCRAFT SIZED LIGHT WAS SEEN AT RADAR SITE AT WADENA AFS, MOVING SOUTH. AT 27/2352A A RED STAR SIZED LIGHT WAS MADE A KWIT RADAR UNCLAS  
SEEN BY PERSONNEL AT OSCOLA AFS, MOVING SOUTH EAST. NO RADAR CONTACT WAS MADE. THOUGH SEVERAL SITES TRIED TO SPOTLIGHT IT WITH HEIGHT FINDERS, THE US SIGHTINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN AIRCRAFT, AS THE PERSONNEL WERE EXPECTING TO SEE SOMETHING. IF IT WAS THE SAME OBJECT IT WAS HEADING ABOUT 160 AT 300 KNOTS FROM SIOUX LOOKOUT TO WADENA, THEN TURNED LEFT TO ABOUT 120 HEADING AND SLOWED TO 120 KNOTS TO OSCOLA. IT LOOKED MUCH LIKE SIMILAR UFOS REPORTED IN THIS AREA DURING LAST WEEK OR TWO. 
IT SEEMS TO BE COMING FROM A REMOTE AREA WEST OF HUDSON'S BAY. MANY UFOS REPORTED TO THIS OFFICE IN LAST TWO YEARS HAVE COME OUT OF THE AREA OR HEADED INTO IT.

IN PHYSICAL EVIDENCE - NONE.
