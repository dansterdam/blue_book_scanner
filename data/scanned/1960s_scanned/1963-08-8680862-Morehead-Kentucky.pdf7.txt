November 20, 1963

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

The sighting of August 2, 1963 which you reported to the Air Force has been evaluated as probably correct.

The information you passed over to the Air Force Base northwest of Morehead, Kentucky indicated that this was not a test aircraft. This has not been confirmed.

Your report passes over Air Force Base low-level test routes in that area north of Morehead, Kentucky. It is possible that this was a test vehicle from this base.

Thank you for reporting this sighting to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
