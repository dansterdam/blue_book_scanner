Transcribed text:

"a quick description of the siting would a couple again of the night. there were no steady long lasting contact but rather a few intermittent contacts which caried and characterised an eratic pattern of flight movement. when the contactors came again in our view and lighted the previously lighted area down toward the ground, it appeared to be in control and maneuvered in a regulated common and logical movement as compared to the initial flights of uncontrolled and unordered course.

In this contacts, it is very much possible to make a good observation as the contactors came again and again in our view and stayed much longer time than the initial sight. it was seen fully illuminated on several occassions and no picture of it could be taken, again the reasons may have been obscure or we might say that any picture-taking-attempt would have disturbed its normal function.

D. The UFO captain wd be anxious to make contact with the crew here.
You would be anxious to have many kind of exchange here.
and all of you eager to take up closely those flying visitations so that you can ascertain what they mean.
There have been hints that instructions and other attempts to make friendly contacts or at least establish understanding, have been made.

Normal Authorities stepped in and are not so cooperative, - coming are checked and the country is hard to penetrate. a well publicised tight control of movements exists with wide nets of surveillance.
so that Colonials stapped and difficulties many sightings.

Your sincere cooperation and understanding of the situation is earnestly required."
