Mrs. G... of Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, reported a UFO observation on 30 Aug 65 at 9:52 pm CST. The object assembled a star comparable in magnitude to the planet Venus. It appeared to be motionless through about 5 degrees across the sky from the North Star and the object disappeared behind tall trees. The closest approach was estimated to be about 3 miles and the altitude estimated to be from 1 degree to 1 1/2 degrees.

The angular rate of about 1 degree per minute is probably underestimated since the position of the object may have been changing in elevation as well as azimuth. The data is characteristic of a satellite. The satellite echo it has a maximum reported altitude of 2780 km over the area at 21:52z. This satellite was over the area at the time and is characteristic in description of a satellite, and coincides with this was the object which was observed.
