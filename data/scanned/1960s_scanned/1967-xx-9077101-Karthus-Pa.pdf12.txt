The image does not contain any photographs, but rather several sketches and diagrams related to UFO sightings. The first sketch shows the line of sight of an observed object above the horizon, with instructions to mark the object's position on a curved line. The second sketch is a compass rose diagram, with instructions to mark the object's position on the compass. The third sketch shows the motion path of an observed object, with instructions to draw the path and indicate any changes in direction.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "G" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
