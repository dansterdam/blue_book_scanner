A - stepped out for some fresh air. As the house was on a hill, I could see a long distance. I saw what appeared to be a hundred stars out, scattered about, seemed to be in a line going in a circle. This was very strange, as I am used to seeing stars scattered about, and not in any particular order or pattern. I watched this for some minutes, and then a gray object appeared to come up out of the trees or hillside. This object appeared to be large, round, and somewhat flat on the bottom. It seemed to move leisurely across the sky, and then disappeared from view behind some trees. I thought at first this was an airplane, but there was no noise, no lights, and the motion was unlike any airplane I had ever seen.
I'll also admit that I have some proof - a written statement from two neighbors who saw the same thing I did that night. But I am some-what reluctant to furnish their names, as I do not want to involve them, unless it is absolutely necessary.
If this was a natural phenomenon, then I have never seen anything like it before. On the other hand, if it was something else, I have no idea what it could have been. It did not resemble any aircraft I am familiar with, and though I supposed it could have been some sort of experimental aircraft, the fact that there was no noise or lights makes me doubt that. In any event, I can assure you that what I saw was very real, and not the product of my imagination.
