The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

The text in the document is as follows:

24. Date you completed this questionnaire: 8th of May 1965

25. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The sky is open above my house and I would say about sixty feet. I thought I saw a pipe, gray or dark on the first light. I'm not sure so I didn't smell it or the drawing. I can't remember if I must while looking through the Binoculand or not. 

I heard the rumble of jets. 
The stars were clearly visible, but some streaks of cloud mist.
Would have any answered sooner but was very busy.
