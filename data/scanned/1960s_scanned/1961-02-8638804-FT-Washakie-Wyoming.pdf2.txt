The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report regarding an unidentified object observed on May 11, 1961 in the Fort Washakie, Wyoming area.

ATIC has not as yet been able to definitely identify the object found in the field. However, it does not in any way constitute a threat to the security of the United States.

Our efforts to identify the object will continue and your Headquarters will be advised of future developments in this case.
