Gentlemen:

I believe I am addressing this letter to the proper authorities but I do not know how to route it by organization. May I request it be directed to the unit responsible for investigating so-called UFOs. 

I am similarly contacting the Chicago Adler Planetarium, Chicago Tribune Newspaper and Sky & Telescope Magazine, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Please note the following customary explanations excluded: Presence of planet Venus, searchlights bouncing off clouds, aircraft navigation lights, meteors or satellite re-entry, optical effects such as auto headlights, aircraft landing lights, etc.

May I respectfully request acknowledgment of receipt of this letter - I do not ask for explanations since I understand this is not customarily done.
