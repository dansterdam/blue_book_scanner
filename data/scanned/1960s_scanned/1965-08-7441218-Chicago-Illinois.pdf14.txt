Dear Major Quintanilla:

I have just located my mislaid notes of our conversation of about two months ago, concerning a USAF object, which was observed in the sky just west of Cassapolis.

At about 0545 hours 8 December 1964, this UFO was observed by me from my backyard for about 45 seconds to 1 minute. It was about 65 to 70 degrees above the northern horizon, moving in a southerly direction. The size of the object appeared to be about 1/3 that of the full moon, and it had a distinct orange-red glow. I was familiar with USAF having observed it many times before. This sighting was called in to the USAF within 1 hour. 

I regret I did not hear from you in the matter, and I trust the above just for the record.

Yours truly,
