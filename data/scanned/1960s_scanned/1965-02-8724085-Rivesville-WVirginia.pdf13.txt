A peculiar UFO was observed on Jan. 18, 1965, by Dr. William A. Schults, a college professor, it Arthur, Ohio. At first, the object appeared as a bright star, but suddenly a concave shell, about eight times larger, came from behind the light, reflecting downward on a vertical shaft the light inside. The shell traveled out of sight at jet plane speed. The professor's report was contained by two witnesses.
