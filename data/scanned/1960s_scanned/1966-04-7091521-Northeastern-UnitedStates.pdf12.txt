There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book report from 1966.

Here is the text from the document, as transcribed:

27 April 1966

East Delhi, New York 11730

Dear Mr.:
Reference is your recent unidentified observation of 25 April 1966. The information which we have received is indicates that you observed a trail of some sort in the sky. Since we do not have the details of your observation in the envelope provided. Since this is a possible meteor observation, we would appreciate it if you could furnish us with two prints to go with the information you have provided. This will enable us to compare the observation with records maintained by the American Meteor Society.

Your report indicates that you took photographs of the trail. We would like to borrow the original negative for evaluation. We would return the negative with two prints to you upon completion of our analysis.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr, Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book"
