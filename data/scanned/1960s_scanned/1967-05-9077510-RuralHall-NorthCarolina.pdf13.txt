The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, but there is no photograph present in this particular page. The text on the page appears to be a handwritten narrative describing a UFO sighting.

The text from the document is as follows:

"34.  Date you completed this questionnaire: 3 May   1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The object was stationary at first, then started moving at a high rate of speed. It was luminous in color and giving off light. It traveled in a straight line and then stopped abruptly. It remained stationary for a while then moved again at a high rate of speed. This was repeated several times. It appeared to be approximately 50-75 feet across and was definitely not an aircraft, satellite or any normal aerial object. The sighting took place in front of witnesses and I actually saw it along with my wife. The object seemed to be at a very high altitude, possibly 10,000-20,000 feet. It did not make any sound and left no trail. The sighting lasted approximately 15-20 minutes. I have not seen anything like it before. It appeared to be under intelligent control. I would not consider myself to be an "expert" but this is exactly what I saw and I am sure of it."
