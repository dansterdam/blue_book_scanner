U.S.A.F.
Washington 25, D.C. 

Dear Sirs,

On "Flying Saucer" (U.F.O.) investigations on April 5, 1964 and a interested in writing a book about them. The title is "Unidentified Flying Objects" (U.F.O.).

I recently saw a movie on T.V. titled "Unidentified Flying Objects" it had two films taken of Flying Saucers flying over parts of the United States. Since then I have become deeply interested in U.F.O.'s. Is there any way that I might be able to get ahold of this movie?

I believe that the thing that I am curious about and what is in "Project Blue Book" could you give me any information on this and what it is about. I would appreciate it very much. If there is any possible way that you could send me books, articles from magazines, newspapers clippings and so forth, I will be pleased.
