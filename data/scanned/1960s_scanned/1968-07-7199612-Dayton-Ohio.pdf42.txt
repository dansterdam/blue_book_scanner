There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

MOVED IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
SUDDENLY SPEEDED UP AND PULLED AWAY?
SEEN BY MANY AND RELIABLE?  
STOPPED FOR NO APPARENT REASON?
GAVE OFF SMOKE?
STAGE STRAIGHT AND LEVEL?
FLASH OR FLICKERING LIGHTS APPEAR?
SOUND LIKE AN EXPLOSION?
LAST A LONG WHILE?
DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
OUT OF SIGHT WENT IT THAT WAY

THE PHENOMENON MOVES BEING LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME.
PPED AND MOVED TOGETHER
