FLYING SAUCER PUZZLE GROWS
It May Be Helicopter-or It May Not:
Four-in-City Report 'Strange Obiects'
In Lansing's continuing rash of strange aerial objects sighted, Police Com-
missioner Edward T. Masselink reported that another four persons had con-
tacted the police department and reported seeing similar UFOs. While these
latest incidents do not duplicate the earlier report of the police officer who
claimed to have seen a strange object hovering over his patrol car, they ap-
parently indicate that some residents of Lansing are observing unusual ob-
jects in the sky. 

John C. DeVos, a night manager at a local drug store, described the ob-
ject he saw as approximately 30 feet in diameter, round and giving off an in-
tense light. He said it was higher than a helicopter and was moving much
faster than a jet plane. Another observer, Mrs. Charles Klise, said she saw
something similar while driving home from work.

The report of the two other observers, still unidentified, stated they saw
an object that seemed to be cylindrical in shape and emitting a bright light.
They said they followed it for several minutes before it disappeared. 

The latest rumors indicate that the strange objects seen in Lansing's
sky may be more prosaic than flying saucers - perhaps they are advanced he-
licopters from a secret military installation. Some observers say the objects
resemble helicopters, flying very fast and high. Others insist they have seen
typical flying saucers.

Police and air force officials continue to investigate the reports, but
so far have been unable to identify the objects with certainty. There has been
no report of any physical evidence such as debris.
