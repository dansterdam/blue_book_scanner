The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing a UFO sighting that occurred on September 4, 1964 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The text in the document states that two independent witnesses provided consistent stories, and they did not rule out the possibility that the sighting was a reflection or mirage. It also mentions that an "ice crystal cloud" reflecting the city lights had been detected.
