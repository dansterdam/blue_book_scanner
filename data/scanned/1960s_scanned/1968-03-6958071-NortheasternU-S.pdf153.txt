Weekly Staff Report Item 		12 March 1968
Subj: Satellite Decay
On March 3, 1968, between 9:45 and 9:50 p.m., EST, numerous observers in the Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania areas sighted several whitish to bluish-white lights that appeared to have orbited together. The major concern was that the lights might be either fragments from a satellite decay or unconventional aircraft. The reports appear to have passed between Pittsburgh and New Castle, Pennsylvania on an approximate northeast heading. The Air Force Office is currently contacting airports, air bases, and police departments in Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts in the areas of reporting for any additional information.
