1. A photo-analysis of your photograph revealed the following information:

"Examination of the negative submitted to
Lieutenant Colonel Quintanilla by the source, shows
the image to be presumably be a photograph of the moon,
made with poor optics. The photo was taken with a
650 box camera, which produced a negative which was
so low in contrast and density as to be inadequate
to permit identification of the areas indicated by
the source to be lighted anomalies appearing
on the imagery. As most probably a combination of debris
and reflections within the optical system, however, with
the limited data available and the poor quality of the
conditions, it is impossible to attach any meaning or
cause to those anomalies."

2. We regret that your negative was lost shortly after the photo
analysis was made. We are returning your photo-print along with
a slide book and some selected (70) case summaries.
