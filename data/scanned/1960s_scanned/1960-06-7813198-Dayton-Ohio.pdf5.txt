20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could sometime in the future see the object that you saw. Of what type material would you guess it was made if? How large would it be, and what shape would it have?
