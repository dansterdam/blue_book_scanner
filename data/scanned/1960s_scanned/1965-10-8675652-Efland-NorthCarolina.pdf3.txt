Dear Miss Hunt:

I sighted the object on the film last Sunday night (October 31st) at approximately 8:00 p.m. outside my home in Efland, North Carolina. It was in the northwestern section of the sky and moved towards the east. The object was triangular in shape and was illuminated in red color. From land and directly overhead, the object was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately fifty degrees. The object was silent in operation and remained in view for approximately five to ten minutes. There was an appearance of different colors at different times. The object would move to the left or right, move closer or pull away. There were no sound effects. I was able to drive 17 miles to my uncle's home to get my camera and take three photographs. The object was seen on the film while the photographer held the camera still. The photographs were taken at f/8 frames per second, and passed the film in the process as much as possible. We have checked the several other people in this area had also seen the object. It is unknown from the high altitude search centers at Williow Grove, Pennsylvania and other air bases searching for such objects that no such sightings have been made. Last month a photograph of an unidentified flying object appeared in the Oklahoma Journal.
The object had been sighted by many people throughout the southwest and their descriptions matched the description of the object I saw.

Sincerely yours,
