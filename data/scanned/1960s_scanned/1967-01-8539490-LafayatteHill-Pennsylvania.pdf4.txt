Dear Sirs:

In reference to your letter of March 16, requesting photos of, and information on the UFO I saw on the night of January 18, this is enclosing all available information, and five color slides, in this letter.

I will attempt to answer the questions in the order in which they have been asked.

A. The camera is the BESELER TOPCON AUTO 100, a 35mm. single-lens reflex, with a bellows-type lens mount.

B. To answer this question, I will quote from my camera manual. "The standard Topcon lens is a 53 mm. focal length optic, with a speed of 2.8 and a distance of focus in four groups. The lens is 2 1/8 in. long, and the distance of 78 cm."

C. ANSCOCHROME D-200 color slide film, with an ASA rating of 200.

D. Because of the darkness, I used a shutter speed of 1/25th, of a second. It was the slowest speed I could shoot at, and still keep the camera steady.

E. I used the largest lens opening of which my lens is capable, that is 2.8.

F. Filters used: none

I am sorry, however, apologize for the poor quality of the five slides. I realize they are not as good as I would like them to hold the camera steady. I am enclosing a separate slide that was taken last year, unfortunately wasn't supposed when it is a picture of the Moon in it's crescent phase, but a few months ago I projected it under high magnification, and found in one corner, a strange bilobed cylindrical object which I believe to be a telescope. I had made sure that there were no aircraft around in the area at the time when this was located with a black arrow.
