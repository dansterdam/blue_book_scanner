The image contains a diagram and related instructions. The diagram appears to show a compass or navigation device, with a circular arrangement of directional headings. The instructions provide guidance on how to use the diagram to describe the movement or trajectory of an observed object in the sky.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how 
high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to 
show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass 
when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object. 

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
