Following was compiled on September 17, 1965:
The only sighting that I have been able to correlate with our sighting was a report from a meteorology student (Jesse Charba). He related a description of the sighting to me without any prior knowledge of my having observed an object of unusual nature. Before informing him of what I had seen, I questioned him in detail about the object he had observed. Although vague, his description of the object no doubt relates to the same thing we had seen. He observed the object from a vantage point about 3 miles south southwest from where we were and about 45 minutes after we had seen it disappear to the west. It was confirmed that his sighting was during the evening of August 2, at approximately 11:00 P.M.
