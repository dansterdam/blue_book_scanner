Gentlemen,

The sighting of various unidentified objects by you and Mrs. Eugene F. Bertrand Jr. on 3 September 1965 near Exeter, New Hampshire, and their report has been forwarded to this office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This incident has attracted considerable publicity through various news media, and Mr. Bertrand has been queried further by my investigators for additional information. This information was released by the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, and Mr. Bertrand was asked to confirm the details, which he did, as is customary. As a result of this activity, the Air Force has received inquiries on the case.

Our investigation and evaluation of this sighting indicates no logical association with an Air Force operation. The objects observed were not known types of aircraft flying in the area, and we have no record of any military air activity during this time period either. While unobserved by personnel engaged in this project, the reports of unidentified objects continued over a considerable period and their actions were not typical of normal aircraft. Since the objects in question did not affect the safety of any aircraft operations, we might consider this of scientific interest only. However, this type of occurrence on a recurring basis does require our attention.

Sincerely,

H.E. QUINTANILLA, Jr. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
