UFO SIGHTING, 4 Oct 66, Rochester, New York

Hq USAF (SAFOIS)
REFERENCE: The attached letter from Mr. and Mrs. regarding their unidentified observation of 4 October 1966.  It is felt that they observed the 2210 time satellite, which was passing over the Toronto, Canada area at approximately 2134 EDT.  This is a frequently observed object, and could have been easily mistaken by naked-eye observers, the motion of a bright artificial satellite frequently constitutes of the familiar illusion described "to the fact that we do not move our eyes continuously, but in little jerks." Fluctuations in the light skin to the twinkling of stars can also account for the illusions (the Sailings do not contain any useful data for analysis).
