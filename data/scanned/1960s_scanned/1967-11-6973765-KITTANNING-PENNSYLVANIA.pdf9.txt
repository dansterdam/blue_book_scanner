1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation.

2. We would appreciate if you could furnish us with the official Air Force reporting form on UFOs. This form gives us much more information than the previous UFO form 14. Request you complete the enclosed AF Form 117 on your observation.

3. Would you also answer the following questions:
a. How did the object disappear?
b. What do you mean when you say that a match held at arm's length would cover" the object?
c. You observed the object for approximately twenty minutes, yet, you were the only observer. Why was this?

3. Thank you for any additional information you can provide.
