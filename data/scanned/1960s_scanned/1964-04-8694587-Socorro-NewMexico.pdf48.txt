We do not feel free to pass on further information on this program because of the restrictions imposed by the prime contractor, Hughes Aircraft Company. Additional information on this project may be in your files or available to you by contacting the Hughes Company.

If it would be of any assistance to you in your present project, we would be pleased to have one of our preliminary design engineers visit you for general technical discussions on "lunar landing gear". If you would prefer to visit us, we would be certainly glad to have you spend a day or two with us. These suggestions, of course, do not place you or the Government under any obligation to us whatsoever.

Very truly yours,
THE CLEVELAND PNEUMATIC TOOL COMPANY

Manager - Sales, Contracts
