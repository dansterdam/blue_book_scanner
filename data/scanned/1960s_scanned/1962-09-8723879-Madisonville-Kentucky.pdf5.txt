One of the most recent reports of angel hair came from Sarine,
Kentucky, on September 23, 1962, where state police and the local
Civil Defense Director were called to investigate a strange substance that looked like spun glass, which had been floating down
near the residence of Mr. Y in great quantities for some hours on
the 22nd. According to the state police and local defense
authorities, the material might be chemicals used in cloud seeding,
which the scientists from a detective filter in a chemical or industrial
plant, or the chemicals that create glass fiber in a chemical or textile
plant, were affected in some way.
The search continued. It is little better than a still hypothetical result-
ing from the activities of migrating spiders. The report concluded: "A substantial amount of angel hair was evidence which cannot be
accounted for, so far as the laboratory tests and the appearance observed
was concerned. It is little better than a still hypothetical resulting
from the activities of migrating spiders which is normal for the season."
The youth migration of spiders and sloughing of some remains in an
environment makes a more reasonable explanation of angel hair: it is far less fantastic than a still hypothetical resulting of a clandestine
origin.
