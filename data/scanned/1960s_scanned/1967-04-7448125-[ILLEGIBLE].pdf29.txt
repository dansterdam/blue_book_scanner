This image does not contain any photograph or image, it is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page appears to be a questionnaire or form with various questions about the observation of an unidentified object.

Here is the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and try to estimate how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
