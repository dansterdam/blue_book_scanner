The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, possibly a UFO report form, with a blank space for the observer to provide additional information about their sighting.

Here is the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: July 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
