This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert K. Lang, USAF, 4500th Air Base Wing Operations Division, Langley AFB, Virginia. The report was made by Captain Cailley, U.S. Coast Guard, who was on duty at the 5th U.S. Coast Guard District Operations to Captain Cailley. Captain Cailley stated the object looked like the "morning star," and was certainly an astronomical body. The object's brightness and size prevented definitive identification.
