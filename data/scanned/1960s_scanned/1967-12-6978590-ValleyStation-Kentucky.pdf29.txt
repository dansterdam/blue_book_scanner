WEATHER BALLOON INFO. AS GIVEN BY SGT. COLEMAN
IN THE METEOROLOGY SECT.

Weather balloons are about 6-to 8 ft. in diameter at launch.
At burst altitudes they may be between 35 and 40 ft. in diameter. 
The burst alt. for the modern case is usually over 100,000 ft.

They are usually launched 4-5 min. before 0000, 0600, 1200, and 
1800 hrs. Zulu.
The time of flight of these balloons is usually 1 to 2 hrs.
The payloads are returned to earth on a small parachute.
Sometimes at night the operator attaches a small light to
the payload. This light is usually sighted by a string to the
payload, and can be seen to about 10,000 ft.

THE RATE OF CLIMB OF THESE BALLOONS IS ABOUT 1,000 FT. PER MIN.
