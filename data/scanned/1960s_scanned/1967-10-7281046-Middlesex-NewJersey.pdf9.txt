This image does not contain any photograph or images, it is a handwritten document. I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

First night, March 5 (Monday)
at 10:12 h had landing, lights on
the "watchtel". I was amazed
to note that the entire
"object" way looking around, and seemed
to be alive rather than
from the ground.

As it came closer, I
got down this (next page)
the entire object - 
Very clearly.
