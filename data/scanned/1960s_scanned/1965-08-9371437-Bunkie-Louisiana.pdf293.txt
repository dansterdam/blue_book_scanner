ADDENDUM III - UFO ACT - 9/3/65
(Continued from page 10)
We started the search out to the north and 
west. We went down the road about ten miles and 
parked to wait for daylight. We could not find 
the object.
He was right. It was coming up over 
the trees about 100 feet high, moving slowly 
southwest. I grabbed my glasses and have him a 
look. But again it was gone from us. I could 
see a bright white light. For awhile it hovered 
and then seemed to rest on the ground a distsance 
off. Then they saw it take off again and be gone 
in just seconds as if taken up by some power.
Nothing was found although we searched 
the area. We could hear buzzing sounds also but 
we could not pin-point the source.
The Bunkie police and the Avoyelles 
parish sheriff's office also reported seeing the 
object.
According to his statement, the witness
first sighted the object about 10 miles from Bunkie, 
Louisiana, at around 1:30 am on September 3, 1965.
The object was described as a bright white light
that hovered and then moved rapidly away. The 
witness, along with the Bunkie police and Avoyelles
Parish sheriff's office, searched the area but could
not find anything. Buzzing sounds were also reported
in the area.
