There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a systematic study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force from 1952 to 1969.

The text in the document reads:

Request compile weather data for Glasgow AFB Montana for Ch 273 at or near C-4002.
