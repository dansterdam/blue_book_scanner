SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14

This report covers the results of the investigation of an unident-1 fied flying object sighting reported from Gwinner, North Dakota on 6 September 1966. The
reporting witness is Sergeant Elmer J. Gasser, stationed at Horace, N.D.

According to Sergeant Gasser, he observed the following:
At approximately 1915 hours on 6 September 1966 he was driving about 3 miles
north of Gwinner, N.D. on N.D. Highway 32 when he observed a bright light in the
sky to the south. The object seemed to be hovering and moving erratically. He drove
on a gravel road west toward the object and stopped when he was approximately
1/2 mile from it. He then observed the object at close range and described it as
cigar-shaped, with a bright white light that seemed to pulse. The object was approxi-
mately 30 feet in length and 6-8 feet in diameter. As he watched, the object suddenly
accelerated upward and disappeared from sight.

Sergeant Gasser immediately reported the sighting to the local sheriff's office.
Upon investigation the sheriff found no physical evidence. An Air Force investiga-
tion team was dispatched to the site, but likewise found no evidence of the reported
sighting.
