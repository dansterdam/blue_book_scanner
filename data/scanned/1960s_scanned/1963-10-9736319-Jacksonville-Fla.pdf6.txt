The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document titled "A BRAZILIAN MYSTERY" that provides an account of an incident that occurred on October 31, 1963 in Rue de Santos, Brazil involving a river, a house, and some unexplained observations.

A BRAZILIAN MYSTERY

The following account is taken from the A.P.R.O. BULLETIN for January, 1964, published by the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, U.S.A., and is reprinted by permission. The information is that because of the difficult conditions the search has had to be abandoned.

On October 31, 1963, Rua de Santos, 8-year-old Elias de Sousa, who live near the river bank, heard a strange noise and went down to the riverside to investigate. He saw water bubbling up from the bottom of the river. The water rose to the level of the bank and then subsided, leaving many fish dead at the point where the disturbance had occurred. The eldest son-in-law of the owner of the house, who was nearby, also witnessed the occurrence.

About half an hour later, Mr. de Sousa heard the roar again and ran to investigate. He saw a portion of the river about 300 feet from the house. All three members of the family watched this phenomenon, which appeared to them like a "wash basin." The object remained at the surface of the water for about 15 minutes, then submerged. As it did so, a great quantity of muddy water and fish mud was displaced.

After this incident, the family members became convinced that something unusual had occurred and decided to report their observations to the authorities. In the meantime, they made preparations to salvage some of the dead fish and tend to the sick animals. In the event and it was from looking at what the investigators discovered later, that the object was metallic and disc-shaped, measuring about 50 feet in diameter. It was also apparently partly submerged in the mud. There were marks and indentations on the ground around where the object had been resting, suggesting that it weighed a considerable amount.

We must consider the possibility that this disc may have been a Brazilian equivalent of the "flying saucer" type of aircraft, both in construction and in the maneuvering ability it displayed. The location and terrain were very suitable for a landing or hovering flight, and if so, it is not inconceivable that repairs or adjustments were being made, and if so, perhaps supplies could be obtained from the nearby town.

UFOs of various types have been reported in the area and it may be that this incident is related to other sightings. It is possible that the craft was damaged or disabled in some way and had to rest there to effect repairs. The only similar incident is the Ubatuba case of 1957, a Swedish ship sank near the location in 1956. We can only speculate as to the purpose of the visit and the identity of the occupants. But the fact remains that the phenomena was observed by competent and reliable witnesses and the indications are that it was a metallic disc-shaped craft of unknown origin.
