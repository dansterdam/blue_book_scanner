Dear Sir:

Have just read in the Clearwater paper that you and others saw lights off the coast on July 5th.

Reportedly (of usual adults) while viewing the fireworks display, they all saw about 5 to 10 minutes three orangeish-red balloonlike objects fly across the sky from south to north.

This was my information that came to me regarding this incident and it seems that many persons in this area did witness the same thing. I am constantly receiving information about unusual things that people see in our sky here, and while some may be identified as ordinary objects, these on July 5th, as described, seem to be unusual objects.

These objects were in the sky for about 5 to 10 minutes and all had disappeared the planes headed towards the east.
