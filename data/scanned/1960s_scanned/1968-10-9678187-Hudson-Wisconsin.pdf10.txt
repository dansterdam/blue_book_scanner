The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the top appears to be a compass rose or direction indicator, with labeled directions like N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW. The text below this sketch provides instructions on how to use it to describe the direction of an object that was seen.

The two smaller sketches at the bottom appear to show silhouettes or outlines of landscapes, potentially depicting how an object was observed in the sky.

Transcribing the text in the image:

"IF, IN THE SPACE BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "T" AT THE POSITION OF THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WHEN LAST SEEN. ALSO, DRAW A LINE CONNECTING THE "X" AND THE "T" TO SHOW THE APPARENT PATH OF MOTION. IF THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SPACE BELOW."
