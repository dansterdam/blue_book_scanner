New Comet Alcock

Among the attractions of May skies is a fairly bright comet, 1963b, discovered by G. E. D. Alcock in England on March 19th. At that time it was an 8th-magnitude diffuse glow near Delphinus. The newcomer was moving nearly directly toward the earth; hence its apparent motion was very slow during the next two weeks.

There is close agreement between the preliminary orbits calculated by E.G. Marsden (Yale University Observatory) and Michael McCants (College Station, Texas). Both show that Comet Alcock is moving in a plane almost perpendicular to the earth's orbit, the inclination being 86.9 degrees. The comet will pass through perihelion on May 6th, 1.45 million miles from the sun.

During May the conditions of visibility will be very favorable, because the earth will be between comet and sun. The comet will be at opposition on May 15th, in declination +30 degrees, only six days after perihelion. Thus Comet Alcock will be well placed for viewing all night long by Northern Hemisphere observers, as it moves southward across Draco, Bootes, and Canes Venatici. In June the comet will pass from Coma Berenices into Virgo.

Apparently, Comet Alcock will verse on naked-eye visibility in mid-May, when its integrated magnitude is predicted as 6.6 by Mr. Marsden, 6.4 by Mr. McCants. However, forecasts of comet brightness are always uncertain, and the object might behave differently.
