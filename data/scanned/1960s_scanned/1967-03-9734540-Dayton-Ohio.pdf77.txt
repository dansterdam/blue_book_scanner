UFO report

At 2030 26 Mar 67, saw fast moving object with flashing red & white lights fly across sky West to East. Then it stopped for a moment. Looked like an airplane but didn't hear any noise. At 2000 (darkness) couldn't see shape at all. Then lights were in a horizontal line.

Capt. G.D. 26 Mar 67
