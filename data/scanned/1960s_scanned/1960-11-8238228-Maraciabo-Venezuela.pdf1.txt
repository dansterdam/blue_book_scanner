The object was hovering at approximately 2000 ft. The object was approximately 50-60 ft. in diameter and appeared to be bright white in color. The object was observed to be hovering and then suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed flying west and was lost to sight in approximately 5 sec. The overall impression given was that this was not an aircraft, but a UFO. The object was fairly close to earth in comparison to the altitude of aircraft in the area.
