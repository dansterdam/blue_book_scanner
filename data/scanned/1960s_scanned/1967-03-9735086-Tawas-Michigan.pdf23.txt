Dear Sirs,
On Monday, March 6 about 8:30 till 8:45 we sighted a UFO over our house. It was dark in color and moved over the address of 1905 South U.S. 23, Tawas City, Mich. It did not give any sound. When it moved on, it had a reddish light that went on and off. It was round in shape and as it was moved quite fast, and was up about 100 feet. It landed in some woods by our house. No one in our neighborhood seen it but my father and I. If it made a noise, we did not get a picture of it.
Yours truly,
SEND [addressed]
