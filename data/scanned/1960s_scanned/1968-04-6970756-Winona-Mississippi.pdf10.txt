The night lights on the road. The lightning Seemed to be more of something being raised up and down. The lights were low to the ground and moving towards the South. They seem to be moving with great speed and intensity, covering the ground very rapidly. I watched, spellbound, for some fifteen minutes or more. They went out of sight behind the trees in the distance. The same lights reappeared in the same area, moving rapidly again and disappearing behind the trees. They reappeared a third time, high in the sky like a shooting star but brighter, disappearing almost instantly. The lights were distinct, being low and close to the ground at first, then high up like a shooting star. This happened three times during the observation.
