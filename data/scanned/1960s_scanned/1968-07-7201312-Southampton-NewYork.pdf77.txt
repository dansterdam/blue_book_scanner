Southampton-12, New York
9 July 1968

DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:

On 7 July 1968, at approximately 11:45 PM, Mr. Jack Huffman, resident of Southampton, New York, observed an unidentified aerial phenomenon over Mecox Bay. Mr. Huffman described the object as cigar-shaped, approximately 100 feet long and 30 feet in diameter, hovering at an altitude of about 500 feet. The object was illuminated with a red glow and emitted no sound. It remained stationary for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

Mr. Huffman immediately contacted the local police department to report the sighting. The officer on duty, Patrolman William Blake, responded to the scene but was unable to observe the object as it had already departed. Patrolman Blake interviewed Mr. Huffman and filed a report with the Southampton Police Department.

This incident has been entered into the Project Blue Book case files for further investigation.
