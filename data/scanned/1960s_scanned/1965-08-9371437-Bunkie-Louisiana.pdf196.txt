"Major Dadier Yeh Is this Major Warren? Do you want a copy of this UFO reports No I just wanted to let you see that I got a summary report on this that I don't know-what's your last diary on it? Let's see based on it, I was looking at 1000ft. Let's just - this man standing here with his pencils sharp. Go ahead, okay, left the man shakes that looks so much that's what I'm talking about. And then at the same time observed the same object said it looked red and green and appeared somewhat larger. Well, several reports UFO 22 miles northeast of here last night 2159 GMT. It appears to be a blinding bright color. New entry 1017. East of here some colored object high and white.

New entry: You are estimating any attitude on any of these? No, I just making them right on. These reports come in faster than we can copy.

I do have some bad attitudes coming in on subsequent reports so will also report on those okay. That's fine 1017. One also appears to have landed 10 miles East of here.

New entry: Okay. 1020: Some night reports 7 UFOs. East of the sight 20-30,000 feet. Okay.

1025 Zone reports 6 UFO stacked vertically. Okay. What entry?

1027 Golf 4 reports 1 ascending. It's climbing. 14,000. Same time Zone reports to additional UFOs have joined the 7 from the 1020 entry make a total of nine. Okay.

1032 Golf 5 reports 2 UFO ascending still further and going east. Another one at 102 degrees almost level and going from east to north. 

1042 2. Golf 1 climbing UFO has leveled off. Okay. Golf sight reported one still climbing and one appears to have lost power and is falling with 4 northwesterly. There now appears that there has been several more sightings and 2 cast of Cheyenne.

1040. Golf reports at 070 degrees at 120 degrees. 2 came from the east, vertical maneuver, has been described as very fast. Looks like it has been getting them back to NORAD and then calling you and I believe I've decided to stay with that sequence. Are you feeling this fine. How about it if it is agreeable with you for me to call Warren--well let's leave that in air. I don't believe Warren with be following this up with I think there will be major interest in this real quick. And your name will be major interest for UNRAD Commander Dye."
