UFO Observation 4 Photograph, 13 Sep 67

Mr.Eugene Conndntino
University of Colorado 

Reference is your letter of 27 March 1963 to which you requested information on the UFO observed by the witness 13 September 1967. the delay in replying, however, was caused by the fact that we did not receive the information on the sighting until 29 September 1967. the witness said he took a photograph. The negative was developed at only one place and therefore no prints were available. We requested information on the sighting and photographic data to respond.

As no copy completed AF Form 117 on the witness' s 27 March 1963 sighting. All to date is his 13 September 1967 sighting.
