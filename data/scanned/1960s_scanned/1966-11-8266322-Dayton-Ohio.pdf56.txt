There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text and a simple sketch or diagram.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it?  If so, how?
I parked and watched the object, but it suddenly disappeared during the observation, 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know.  If you answered YES, then tell what:
No response. 

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know.  If you answered YES, then tell what:
No response.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Absolutely Silent
b. Color: Metallic,

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object would be covered by the match head. This will give us the angular size. Based on this experiment of the UFO, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
They covered a very large area, about 20 degrees of the sky. 

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically show the direction the object was moving. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
