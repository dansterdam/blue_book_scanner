Subject: Congressional Investigation of the UFO Program

1. (Mr. General Pierce)
1. An article appeared in the 12 July 1961, issue of Newsweek, stating that the possibility of a Congressional investigation of the USAF UFO program is being considered through contact with the Secretary of the Air Force Legislative Liaison Office. Procedures concerning such an investigation, however, SAFLL pointed out that we actually have no investigation going on and any investigation would have to be in connection with the official USAF UFO program.

2. Official sources (SAFLL) have it that Congressman Joseph E. Karth, Chairman of the House Science and Astronautics Committee (Congressman Overton Brooks, Los Angeles Chairman) would need the investigating team to determine if the USAF investigation is adequate for the Trespass Act and for other legal considerations. This investigation would require the Aerial Phenomena Branch TD-5 to the analysis and investigation areas.

3. Hazen GAYLE's present efforts are directed toward briefing off the investigation of his own group. It is desired that the entire investigations group, including the evaluation and briefing teams, such as Major Robert J. Friend, Aerial Phenomena Branch TD-5 is in attendance.

4. NOTE: If the investigation is carried out at PTD, I intend to handle it with the Deputy unless otherwise directed.
