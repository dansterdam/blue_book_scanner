ATTN OF: TDEED/Mr. Bryant/pkj/74201
SUBJECT: Radar UFO Sightings (U)

TO: TDEW (TSgt Moody)

On 14 July 65, radar targets on the scope were evaluated, and it is the opinion of this office that the targets are real and in all probability are high-altitude balloons. This analysis is based on the following facts:

a. The speeds of the targets (indicated only once) are too low aircraft and are typical for high-altitude balloons.
b. The altitudes of the targets are too high for normal aircraft, but are readily attainable by high-altitude balloons.
c. It is understood that at least two high-altitude balloons had been lost just previous to the radar sightings.
