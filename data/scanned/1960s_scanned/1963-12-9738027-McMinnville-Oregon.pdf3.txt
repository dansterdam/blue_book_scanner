2 December 1964

Dear [redacted],

Your recent letter to Doctor J. Allen Hynek has been forwarded to me for the case file on your sighting of 11 December 1963 at McMinnville, Oregon.

Since you processed a desire to know of the final evaluation of this case, I am enclosing our evaluation and recommendation concerning your report. 
Dr. Hynek considered the possibility of a flight record and therefore did not support this evaluation. However, the objects were not detected long enough for precise measurements, and the photographic evidence is inconclusive. It is the opinion of this evaluation that the sighting can be satisfactorily explained as a relatively common and recurring type of aerial phenomenon.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACOBS
