DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 20330

OFFICER OF THE SECRETARY

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This will reply to your letter of August 29, 1968, and the Department of Defense stated that you have reported a UFO sighting during the period of April 24, 1967 and 1968.

Unfortunately, your UFO sightings of 1967 and 1968 are not enough to permit a scientific evaluation. We have found that any previous investigation tend to become too vague to permit an accurate evaluation. Therefore, we cannot use your 1968 sighting, and mail it in the enclosed envelope, people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will take a further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please submit the details to the Air Force, as this will permit a more complete spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate evaluation.

On the other hand, you might be able to identify your sightings as the sightings of objects reported as UFOs. Send any additional material on this subject that you may have.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
