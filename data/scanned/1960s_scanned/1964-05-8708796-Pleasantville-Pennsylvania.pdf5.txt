Dear Sir:

Your report of observations on the night of 6 May 63 is indeed interesting. From your letter it appears that the object observed by your members was similar to phenomena described by astronomers and other observers on the same night from the vicinity of Dennison Observatory at Allegheny College, Pennsylvania.

The attached brochure represents the Air Force's present position on UFO's. The U.S. Air Force, through its NICAP program, does not consider the evidence contained in this or similar cases as constituting proof of the existence of "flying saucers" as they are popularly believed to exist. NICAP has no connection with any other private or governmental agency which would indicate that unidentified flying objects exist as a threat to national security, which would indicate the existence of interplanetary space vehicles, or which would serve as a basis for public alarm about UFO's.

The Air Force has consistently maintained that there is no evidence which would indicate that unidentified flying objects pose a threat to the security of the United States, nor is there evidence that such objects represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientific knowledge. The Air Force position remains that any objects observed, once identified from a technical standpoint, can be explained in terms of known or conventional phenomena.
