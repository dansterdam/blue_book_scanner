SUBJECT: UD SIGHTING ON 7 JAN 69

1. The serial message which is an extract of a Telex between NAVAIR and USAF is the record of a UD sighting from Crittenden, Virginia (Coordinates 37.43N, 76.55W) which occurred on 7 Jan 69 at about 0100 hours EST. The observer stated that he sighted a clear shaped object that produced a low rumbling sound and moved at high speed (estimated speed 450-500 knots) and was visible for about 20-30 seconds.

2. No other similar reports from that period could be identified.

3. Because the report is similar to past reports of helicopter activity, we would like to know if you had any helicopter activity in that area that night limited.
