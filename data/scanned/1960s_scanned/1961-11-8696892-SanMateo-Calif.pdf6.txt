TUNNEL SHELTER PROPOSAL TOLD

A group of members of the Westlake Improvement Association appeared to present that their entrance to the new school on the San Mateo side of the tunnel will create a traffic hazard on Skyline Blvd.
Police Chief W. Stein of 397 Fairlawn Dr. said that the formation of the group was aimed apparently to defeat the second entrance on the eastern side that would pass too close to Fernando Rivera school. The council denied a previous appeal for the destruction of a pedestrian overpass near the Fernando Rivera school.
