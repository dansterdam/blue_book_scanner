The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing the sighting of an unidentified object. The text in the document is as follows:

About two months ago it doesn't make any difference when it was. It was shout a quarter past seven in the evening and I had just finished supper and was sitting in my living room reading a magazine. I noticed out of the corner of my eye a bright light out by the clothesline in the back yard. I went to the back door to investigate and saw what appeared to be a round object about fifty yards from the house hovering about thirty feet off the ground. It was about the size of a basketball. The object was perfectly round and was glowing a bright orange color. After watching it hover for about a minute, it suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared from sight in about three seconds. The whole incident lasted only about a minute and a half.

I called the Air Force the next day and reported the incident. The Air Force sent out an investigator to interview me a few days later. He seemed very interested in the incident and asked me many questions about what I had seen. He said the report would be forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation. That's the last I've heard about it.

Dear Sir: It is our hope that you took into this and assume we a forced explanation for these sightings. The thought of the unknown and what it could mean is fascinating, and it is our purpose to be as objective as possible about sighting like this one.
