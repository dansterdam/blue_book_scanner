The sighting of August 13th, 1957 A.M. Eastern Daylight Time/August 12th 4:17 U.T.: The object was best reported, and it will be described by other sightings of this type. 

Mr. *** had been out most of the night watching for the appearance of the object he sighted the night before. On the hydrographic chart it was a meteorographic condition to be kept at a watch all that morning. He had left his house and had gone in for just a few minutes before 4:17 A.M. and kicked himself for doing this since. When he got outside, there object sighting, disappeared, apparently moving away from the area to the south and proceeded at a rate of about 2° per second. It was about 30° or 40° from the western horizon, where it faded out. The entire journey in 25 plus or minus 5 seconds (when it was estimated at 35 seconds). It seemed to move definitely faster than Echo, but by no means as fast as the rustle out a slow meteor on several counts. He also rustle cut cause he says that the Nov zodiacal light occurrence flight caused him to be extremely familiar with planets from that standpoint, and from the experience in the Naval Air Force as a radar operator for some years.  

It is interesting to point out that if the objects are successful, a retrospective satellite, the period would have been 1 hour and this giving an average height of 327 miles and an angular speed that observed. There is the outside possibility that he observed a natural satellite which would have had a life of just a few days watched that night until dawn but the object did not reappear. It would have been considerably more this object in the earth's shadow at about 2:00 A.M.
