We reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation in the above subject. Unfortunately, we do not have any photographic data to confirm your observation, however, correspondence with you and any persons present is still appreciated.

2. Questions of your sighting are confirming: at times we find it difficult to distinguish what you observed you may have seen. Could you provide a more detailed description of the object, its size, shape, color, speed, direction of movement, and duration of the sighting (two hours) to the best of your recollection? Any additional data would be most helpful in assessing the nature of the occurrence.

3. You also indicated that you saw "the object" on a radar display. Since additional indication was that it was then "visually sighted", please clarify how long it was painted, what altitude, speed and direction of travel it displayed, and any other pertinent radar data available.

4. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
