The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains two sketches rather than photographs.

The top sketch depicts what appears to be a saucer-shaped object in the sky. The image instructs the viewer to place an "X" on the sketch where they saw the object.

The bottom sketch appears to show a landscape viewed through a curved lens or windshield, with a person standing in the road.

Transcribing the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please an "X" on the sketch to show the position of the object as you first saw it. Place a "Y" to show the position of the object when you last saw it. Please give time interval between "X" and "Y" positions.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was in when you first saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this.
