Project Blue Book Case No. 8699462
Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana
April 8, 1964

WITNESS STATEMENT:

On April 8, 1964, the witness was driving toward the Canyon Ferry Reservoir near Helena, Montana when he noticed an unusual aerial object in the sky. The object was metallic in appearance and shaped like a disk. It was hovering in the air and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. The witness was able to take a photograph of the object before it disappeared.

The witness reported the sighting to the local authorities, who in turn notified the Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation of unidentified flying objects. Project Blue Book investigated the sighting and concluded that the object was likely a conventional aircraft or weather balloon, and not an extraterrestrial craft.
