I observed a strange object in the evening sky over Irvington, New Jersey. It appeared to be round, and had a silvery metallic appearance. It was at an altitude of approximately 1000 to 1500 feet and was moving in an irregular pattern, sometimes stopping and hovering, then moving off again. I watched it for about 20 minutes before it disappeared. The object did not make any sound that I could hear. I am a 25 year old male, and was alone at the time of the sighting. Please let me know if you require any additional information.
