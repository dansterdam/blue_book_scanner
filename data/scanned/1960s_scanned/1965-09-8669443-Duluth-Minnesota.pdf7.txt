PRELIMINARY REPORT
INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
1. Date and Time of Observation: 8 September 1965, 2005 hours
2. Location: Near Duluth, Minnesota
3. Time zone: Central Standard Time
4. Weather Conditions: Clear sky, good visibility
5. Description of Object: A bright light was observed moving across the sky. It was described as pulsating and changing color from white to red. The object was observed for several minutes.
6. Number of Witnesses: 2
7. Further details: The two observers were driving on a country road near Duluth when they observed the bright light in the sky. They stated that the object was at a high altitude and appeared to be much larger than a conventional aircraft. The object did not make any sound and moved across the sky in a straight line before disappearing from view.
8. Conclusions: This incident remains classified as "Unidentified." While the description of the object is consistent with a meteor or other natural phenomenon, the reported pulsating and color changing behavior is not typical. Additional investigation may be warranted to determine the exact nature of the observed object.
9. Recommendations: Continue monitoring and investigating similar reports from the Duluth area.
