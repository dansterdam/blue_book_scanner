There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

Dear Mr. _____,

This is in reply to your letter in which you forwarded two photographs for possible analysis. We are unable to have your photographs analyzed at this time as they were not included with your letter. If you will forward the photographs, we will be happy to have them analyzed and will discuss the results with you.

Sincerely,

J. Allen Hynek (2)
Astrophysicist
