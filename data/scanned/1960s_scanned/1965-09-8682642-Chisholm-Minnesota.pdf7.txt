The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a report about a UFO sighting that occurred in Chisholm, Minnesota on September 29, 1965.

The text in the document is as follows:

CHISHOLM, MINNESOTA 
29 SEPTEMBER 1965

These 5-9755, observer, noted five strange colored objects in the west at an elevation of about 30Â°. All of a sudden three of the objects made a turn toward the southwest and the other two seemed to just disappear. Within a minute or two one of the objects reappeared and made a turn toward the southeast and then also disappeared. He also stated that the objects were moving much faster than a jet, which he had watched before. Particular attention was given, by the witness, to the objects and 22 green lights which he had never seen on an aircraft. He stated these were none.

COMMENTS
The observation has characteristics of being either aircraft or other flying objects, however, certain factors conflict with such a conclusion. A weather balloon from Duluth would have been in the area at the time of the observation, however, distortion scintillation with this condition since the witness denies any resemblance to such an object. Also, there was no reported aircraft in the area and the objects traveled much faster than an aircraft and made extremely sharp turns. As such, the case must remain in the unidentified category.
