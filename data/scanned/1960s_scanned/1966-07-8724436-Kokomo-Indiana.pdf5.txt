illustrates the configuration. The lights seemed, on recollection and by experiment, to be as big as a penny between 18 and 24 inches from the eye, approximately two degrees. Mr. Dieterly suggested that they were as big as an automobile, and the ladies said no, they must have been bigger than a 707 jet. There were no conclusions reached for determining actual size.

All the witnesses had thought of searchlights, but had decided that the spots were not from searchlights for several reasons: 

1. The motions were far too fast for a large searchlight to have produced. Illustrations of the motion using a hand-held flashlight indicated that the movements were as fast as the flashlight could be moved by hand. 

2. No rays of light could be seen extending up from the ground, as one would expect on a hazy night. 

3. There were no commercial establishments in the direction toward which the lights were the general indication was that the source would have to be in open country.

4. The lights were too bright to have been produced by anything smaller than a large anti-aircraft light. All the four witnesses agreed that there was a halo of brightness around the area of the lights, as if they were illuminating nearby haze. 

5. All they saw were stars and the moon, and concluded that there were no clouds for a searchlight to play on. 

The ladies were on their way to Russiaville, five miles west on Rte. 26, which is the county road 100 south, 1-1/2 miles south of where they were parked. They proceeded on to Russiaville after watching for some twenty minutes with Mr. Dieterly. Russiaville is located at 750 west and 400 south. The ladies parked in Russiaville with the car pointed north at this point they could see the lights.
