Sept. 7, 1960

Dear Sir:-
Am sending some thing which I thought you might be interested in. I do not know what it is, but it seems to be a piece of metal. It is hollow and some what square in shape. It was found on our farm by my granddaughter while she was walking in the field. We have kept it in our possession and I am sending it to you to see if you can make any suggestions as to what it might be.

I will be anxiously awaiting your reply.

Sincerely,
