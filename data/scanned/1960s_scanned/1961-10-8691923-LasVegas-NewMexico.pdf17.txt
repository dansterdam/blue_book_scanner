CIVIL FLIGHTS IN THE EXERCISE AREA DURING SKY SHIELD. ARRANGEMENTS TO DO SO HAVE BEEN MADE IN COOPERATION WITH THE AGENCIES CONCERNED. PART II. SINCE CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS OF SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT WILL BE ENGAGED IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT SONIC BOOM DISTURBANCES WILL OCCUR. THE INVOLVEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS NOT NORMALLY FREQUENTED BY SONIC BOOMS, THE VOLUME OF SUPERSONIC OPERATIONS AND THE LATE NIGHT HOURS ARE FACTORS THAT WILL COMBINE TO GENERATE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS AND/OR INQUIRIES. IT CAN BE EXPECTED THAT MANY OF THE QUERIES WILL BE DIRECTED BY TELEPHONE TO THE NEAREST AIR FORCE INSTALLATION. PART III. A. COMMANDERS, IOS AND OTHER AIR FORCE PERSONNEL RECEIVING SUCH QUERIES WILL NOT TAKE NEGATIVE APPROACH OR QUOTE PASS THE BUCK UNQUOTE. IMMEDIATE, COURTEOUS, POSITIVE ACTION TO IDENTIFY THE COURSE AND EXPLAIN THE CAUSE WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF PART I ABOVE ARE ESSENTIAL TO MINIMIZE ADVERSE PUBLIC REACTION. B. IF A POSSIBLE DOUBT EXISTS THAT THE DISTURBANCE IN QUESTION WAS ACTUALLY A SONIC BOOM AN IMMEDIATE CHECK WILL BE MADE WITH THE NEAREST AIR FORCE DEFENSE SECTION DIRECTION CENTER TO DETERMINE IF SUPERSONIC FLIGHT WAS IN FACT CONDUCTED AT THE TIME AND PLACE IN QUESTION. ADC WILL AUGMENT DIRECTION CENTERS AS NECESSARY WITH QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO GO TO THIS EVENTUALLY. G. IN THE EVENT OF DAMAGE TO PRIVATE PROPERTY THE NEAREST AF CLAIMS OFFICER WILL BE NOTIFIED AND IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE WILL BE OFFERED IN FILING A CLAIM. D. THE AF COMMAND POST WILL BE NOTIFIED BY MOST EXPEDITIOUS MEANS IN CASE OF UNUSUAL AND/OR WIDESPREAD DISTURBANCE. PART IV. ALL PERSONNEL PERFORMING THE FUNCTION OF ANSWERING PUBLIC INQUIRIES WILL BE BRIEFED IN DETAIL TO INSURE THAT THEIR RESPONSES ARE UNIFORM, ACCURATE AND WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THIS PLAN.
