THIS TIME 10:25 13 OCT 1955
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
1. REFERENCE REPORTS MADE IN THIS CASE BY LT COL CHARLES S. HATCHER, USAF
2. INVESTIGATION OF ABOVE CASE IS COMPLETE AND THE FOLLOWING DETAILS ARE SUBMITTED:
3. ON 13 OCTOBER 1955, AT APPX 1950 HOURS, A REPORT OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS RECEIVED FROM MR. STANLEY J. LARSON, 4207 S. WILKESON, TACOMA, WASHINGTON.
4. LARSON STATED THAT HE FIRST OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY OVER LARSON AFB, WASH, WHICH APPEARED TO BE MOVING ERRATICALLY. HE THEN CONTACTED THE BASE OPERATIONS OFFICE AT LARSON AFB, AND LEARNED THAT NO KNOWN AIR TRAFFIC WAS IN THE AREA.
5. IN CHECKING FURTHER, LARSON DETERMINED THAT THE OBJECT HE HAD OBSERVED WAS APPARENTLY NOT AN AIRCRAFT, BUT AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. HE STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 200 YARDS IN DIAMETER, AND THAT IT MOVED RAPIDLY THROUGH THE SKY, MAKING SUDDEN STOPS AND STARTS, AND VERY ABRUPT CHANGES IN DIRECTION.
6. LARSON FURTHER STATED THAT HE OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES, AND THAT SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS IN THE AREA ALSO OBSERVED IT. HE SAID THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO MAKE A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT.
7. INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT BY LT COL CHARLES S. HATCHER, USAF, INDICATES THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED BY MR. LARSON AND OTHERS WAS PROBABLY A WEATHER BALLOON. DUE TO THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS EXISTING AT THE TIME, IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE BALLOON WOULD HAVE EXHIBITED THE CHARACTERISTICS DESCRIBED BY MR. LARSON.
8. IN VIEW OF THE ABOVE FINDINGS, THIS CASE IS CONSIDERED CLOSED.
