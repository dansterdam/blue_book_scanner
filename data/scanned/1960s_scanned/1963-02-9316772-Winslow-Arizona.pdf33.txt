Stratospheric Cloud over
Southern Arizona

Abstract: An unusual ring-shaped
cloud was observed and photographed
over southern Arizona on four occasions
during the period 28 February 1963 to
12 March 1963. Reports of its appearance
are known to have appeared elsewhere
during this period, but no additional
information is available. The cloud was
observed on four photos taken in Tucson, 130
miles south of the cloud, in distinct
angles. The diameter of the cloud is estimated
to have been about 40 kilometers.
The most distant observation reported was
made 160 miles from the cloud. The
cloud remained stationary for about
35 minutes after local sunset. Iridescence was noted
by some observers. The
unusual shape, size, and brightness of the
cloud tended to be reminiscent of
a macroeus cloud: but its unusually great
height and brightness for a stratospheric
cloud suggest it may have been in the
nature of an atmospheric distortion or
anomaly.

Near sunset, on 28 February 1963, a
cloud of unusual configuration and coloration was observed in widely scattered
locations in Arizona and Springerville,
New Mexico (some 15C miles east
of Flagstaff, Arizona). At about 180 miles
east of Flagstaff this cloud as seen against
the sun, which had already set (R.E. Daniels, Springerville, Arizona).
The observers saw this long, thin, running
cloud pass before the sun, making a
bright Illuminated wall after the sun
had set on the horizon. Close comparison 
of this cloud with the sunset
sky to the south. its angular elevation appeared
to be rather (3 degrees). A rough geometric
construction (1) made immediately after
the cloud entered the scene showed a
elliptical ring-shaped configuration similar
to a horseshoe. Attempts were made
for confirmatory reports in order to
establish the approximate location and
dimension of this unusual cloud formation.

From approximately 130 reports,
many communicated by persons in
widely scattered locations, the unique
cloud unprecedented in years of sky-
watching is was quickly established to
have been observed over a wide area in the
vicinity of Flagstaff, Arizona, that it
exhibited characteristics of the rare altoCumulus
cloud formation (Ac 3), and that it
interacted strangely with the sun.to produce
striking color effects. The cloud appeared
green and blue ware visible, and a
pinkish cast was noted at times in
the cloud shape. The unusually great
height, diameter, and "wood grain"
appearance, was present
over much of its northern extent, but
