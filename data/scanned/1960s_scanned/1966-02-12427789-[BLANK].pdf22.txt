The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document discussing various types of rockets and their characteristics.

Some other things launched at Wallops which may be visible to the public (probably not the Norfolk area) are:

Arcas rockets which have a 15-ft. orange and white parachute to lower the payload from high altitudes in the neighborhood of 200,000 ft. Sometimes it takes 3 hours to impact in the water.

Arcas-Robin rockets which have a payload consisting of a 1-yard diameter sphere which is inflated to obtain meteorological data.
