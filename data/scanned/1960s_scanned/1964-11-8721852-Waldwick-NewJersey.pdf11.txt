Farmer Observes Sphere

At 8:00 p.m. on 7 November 1964 Trevor Foulds, a farmer in Waitaki, New Zealand, responded to his son John's call to watch a light in the northern sky. Foulds went outside and saw a ball of light, brighter than any star traveling south toward him.

The UFO homesteaded in the hills 1,000 feet above sea level. Using his night binoculars Foulds saw and another witness, who has asked to remain anonymous, observed the UFO. It first appeared in the north to the southern horizon.

Foulds, like other farmers in the area, has been observing on behalf of APRO, said that two minutes prior to "first sighting" the trees shook. They had seen a bright light in the east move toward the west. The object presented a spherical shape in the east more clearly and a quarter moon was seen to the west behind the shining luminous object.

It, did not pass directly overhead, but rather slightly away-presenting a vertical elliptical shape. The object presented a spherical shape in the east more clearly and a quarter moon was seen to the west behind the shining luminous object.

According to Foulds, the object was approximately 40 feet in diameter and was surrounded by a brilliant white light, with a dark band around the center. The rotating light seemed to be a brilliant white and were moving downwards and towards the center. The object was observed for about ten minutes, during which it disclosed 6 jet-like objects at the rear, the nature of which was not determined. The jets gave off a brilliant light blue flame. Mr. Foulds was unable to identify the craft, which lasted the full of his observation.

Foulds, his son John (18) and a worker named John (41) all observed the craft, but apparently were clearly as they were not equipped with binoculars.
