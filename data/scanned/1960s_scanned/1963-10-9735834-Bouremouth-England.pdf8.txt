UFO SIGHTING (BOURNEMOUTH, ENGLAND)
1. MRS USAT 3-401-P3 (Mrs Golaris) 
On 22 December 63, Mrs Golaris of 75, Shermanston Avenue, Bournemouth, Hants, England, saw an unidentified object in the sky.

2. At about 1800 to 1810 hours (GMT), the observer observed an object described as brighter than the stars. The object gave a report of about 250 deg azimuth; this is the direction from a compass point where the object was seen. The object was to the right or north as the observer faced the object. 

3. Antares, a first magnitude star (Mv 1.1) was on the horizon at 205 deg azimuth at the time of the sighting. Also, Mars with a magnitude of +1.7 was at 15 deg SW with a dec-clination of -21.8 deg. Between 1800 to 1810 hours on 10 Oct the Moon was at 23 deg (Mv -12.6). Therefore, the declination of the object, if it was celestial, could not contribute to this sighting.

4. The observer indicated that a dark red sky was to the right or north of the object. The reddish color is suggestive of the object being closest to the horizon while the observer faced it. 

5. To the sighting or reflection of Mars or Antares, analysis tends to indicate that this is more closely associated with her report.
