The image contains a compass diagram with a directional arrow and a question asking the viewer to draw a picture showing the motion of an object or objects. There is no photograph present in this image.

37. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the object you have seen. Then, draw a line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "G" on the skyline at the point where the object appeared, and place a "B" at the point where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.  

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, draw a picture of how many there were, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
