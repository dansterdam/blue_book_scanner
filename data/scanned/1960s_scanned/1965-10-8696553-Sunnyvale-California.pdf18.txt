On October 12th several Connecticut newspapers published a UFO photo taken at Sunnyvale, California. The boy was doing schoolwork when he heard a humming sound which Rogers Litchfield, an electronics technician, says was coming from a high pitch, round object. It was followed by a thin disc which rose rapidly upwards into the sky where it disappeared, and that it was traveling about 700 miles per hour.
