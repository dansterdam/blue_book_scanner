ZANESVILLE, OHIO, FEB. 6, 1966 - BARBERS REPORTEDLY SAW FAST MOVING OBJECT PASSING UNDER GAS LINE POLES FOR SOME EXTENT IN SKY WHILE AT WORK - 

TALKED ABOUT WHO, WHERE, WHEN & WHAT THEY SAW - -

TWO BARBERS SAID THEY SAW A UFO PASS UNDER POWER LINES AT ZANESVILLE, OHIO ON FEBRUARY 6, 1966. THEY DESCRIBED IT AS BEING ROUND AND SHAPED LIKE A HATBAND. THOUGH IT WAS UNIDENTIFIED, THEY SAID IT MOVED RAPIDLY, PASSED UNDER THE GAS LINE POLES, AND SAILED AWAY IN A FEW SECONDS.

ALSO, THEY SAID HE TOOK THREE PHOTOGRAPHS, ONE WHILE IT "HOVERED", ONE AS IT MOVED AWAY. HOWEVER, WHEN DEVELOPED, THE PHOTOGRAPHS DIDN'T SHOW ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS THERE, AND THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THEM.

THEY SAID THEY DON'T BELIEVE HIM YET, HE SAID HE WAS AFRAID OTHERS WOULD FIGURE HIM FOR A CRACKPOT OR A LIAR. ABOUT 4 MONTHS AGO HE REPORTEDLY HAD ENCOUNTERED A SIMILAR SITUATION WHEN HE TRIED TO SHOW SOME FRIENDS A PICTURE HE HAD TAKEN OF A UFO. THE GROUP APPARENTLY DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM AND SAID IT WAS JUST A SPOT ON THE PICTURE.

THE NEWSPAPER STAFF ENLARGE A REPRINT MADE FROM THE FILM, AND ONE LOOKS "LIKE A HATBAND ON 26 STRING". THOUGH IT PASSED UNDER THE GAS LINE POLES RAPIDLY, HIS HOUSE FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN SAILED AWAY.
