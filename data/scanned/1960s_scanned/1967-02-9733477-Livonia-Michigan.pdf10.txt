UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT CASE FILE

Case No. 12345
Date of Sighting: 02/09/1967
Location: Livonia, Michigan

Weather Conditions: Clear, no cloud cover
Witness: John Doe, private citizen

On February 9, 1967, at approximately 8:00 PM, Mr. Doe observed a bright light in the sky over his residence in Livonia, Michigan. The light appeared to be stationary at first, then moved in an erratic pattern, changing direction and speed. It was visible for approximately 10 minutes before disappearing from view. 

Mr. Doe was able to photograph the object, but the resulting image is of poor quality and does not clearly show the details of the object. The photograph has been included as part of this report.

This case is classified as unidentified, as the available evidence is insufficient to determine the nature or origin of the object observed. No further investigation is planned at this time.
