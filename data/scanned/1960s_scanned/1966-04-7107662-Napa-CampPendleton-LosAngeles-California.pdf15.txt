Dear Sir:

After reading an article in U.S.O. Talk Article for Vandenberg on April 23 issue of the Bonnews Register, I would like to report that on April 26, about 4:30 a.m. I observed a green or blue-green cloud or luminous mass. It moved from east to west and had a definite shape that did not change as it moved.

The mass also a white light that disappeared as it moved.
