[TEXT FROM DOCUMENT]:

with men unencured to reporting matters outside their normal line of duty, I have a stran ge feeling that the data I have is not sufficient for reporting singular rates, angular distances in the sky, brightnesses, and in general, time motion sequences. I was forced, therefore, to take into account and regard as facts, only such things which had been reported fairly consistently by several witnesses. The doubt cast upon certain witnesses by other witnesses did not inspire in me a feeling of confidence as to the quality and reliability of the data. I must use or I was obliged to use from which to draw my conclusions. I therefore felt that the only expedient thing to do was to concentrate on the consistent aspects of the stories from Dexter and Hillsdale and place into another category the host of the individual and generally mutually conflicting bits of testimony offered by the men individuals I talked to during my three day study.

I therefore decided to look at the common pattern which seemed to be developing in the Dexter and Hillsdale cases. These had many interesting points in common. First, the lights were definitely associated with a swamp area. While it was true that various individuals reported lights traveling in the sky at some other times, those times of sky lights did not seem to fit the general pattern of the Dexter and Hillsdale cases.
