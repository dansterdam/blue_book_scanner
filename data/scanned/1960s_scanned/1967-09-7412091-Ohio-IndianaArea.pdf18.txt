MEMO FOR THE RECORD
20 Sept. 1967

Called Indianapolis Center (317-244-2495 ) about aircraft sighting
of 14 Sept. 08/;02; 04 09172.
At the present we have the report of the Saturn 777 but we 
have no info. on the Universal 689. The controller John E presdorf
said that the Sept of the 777 may know the Capt of the 689. He also
said that both reported the 08/02 sighting at the same time and
gave the same position for the object. Later both reported
bright lights off of their right wings. Radar at the center
sporadically painted an object off the right wing of the 689
for about 20 mins. However Mr. Presdorf said that it might have
been what he called Angels, because it was a sporadic paint,
very close in a while they would see something for only a sweep
or two.
