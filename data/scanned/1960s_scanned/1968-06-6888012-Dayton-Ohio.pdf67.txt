Dear Col. Quintanilla:

A matter of a week or so ago, I recall reading in our news paper and hearing on the radio that the UFO is no longer being investigated and I can not buy it. 

There are space-ships and very real, as to where they come from, like the Air Force and Project Blue Book, I like-wise don't know, can tell you, they can not.

Believe me, I am not a nut or am I look1ng for fame. I'm only trying to make you people realize that UFO's are flying around!

As to what kind of beings they may be or as to what kind of power they use or cause is unknown to me, I can only say, they have my own ideas on that matter.

It is, in my mind, that is very possible for them to come from outer-space and this is a fact, then they could be from the USSR or the USA and I doubt the former, then they come from the latter. 

I would appreciate it very much that we get the truth once and for all on this matter.
