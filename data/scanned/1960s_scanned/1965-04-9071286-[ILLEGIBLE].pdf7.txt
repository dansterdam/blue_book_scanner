(It seems quite a few years ago that I believe a twin plane.) Since I had never seen such a plane in the sky I kept looking at it. There were about 10 lights.

During this time, and for several minutes afterward, I heard no airplane motor noise. Each light was the same size - a pinpoint (as the stars) - not as big as the lights I'm accustom.

Total time elapsed: about 7 seconds. Holding a tape measure at arm's length, the expanse of sky was 5". Angle of view: Eastward, the lights at a 45Â° angle to the north. Lights continuously moving.
