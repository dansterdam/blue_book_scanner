CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - 14 AUG 61
STEVE A FAVER, a 17-year-old student, has reported to have seen an unidentified flying object (UFO) on 31 January 1961. The object was over a building several blocks away in about a minute's time. He didn't think much of it at the time.
Several weeks later the Adler Planetarium persons, almost one year before, had sighted the same object. It was reported to be metallic and shaped like a saucer. Faver was intrigued by this fact and tried to determine if his sighting could be the same object.
Faver asked that a meteorite expert from USAFOTL be consulted to get an opinion. He has viewed many meteor showers and said this was not similar to any meteor shower he had seen. Asked what he thought it might have been, he replied, "I honestly do not know."
