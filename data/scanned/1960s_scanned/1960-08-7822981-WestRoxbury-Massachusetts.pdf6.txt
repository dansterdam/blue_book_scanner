To whom it may concern:

Recently I received a letter from the Smithsonian Institution requesting information regarding a UFO incident which I saw in the West Roxbury, Massachusetts area.

This matter is of great importance to me because it has bothered me since the object was sighted and passed the information on to other people. I would like to see if there is any ordinary explanation to it.

If there is any ordinary objection I have discussed,  I would like to know about it, please address any information to: [redacted]
West Roxbury, Massachusetts

Respectfully,
