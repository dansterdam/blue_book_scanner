It was about 9 PM on April 18, 1967 in Tucson, Arizona. I sighted a round orange or reddish pulsating light hovering over a residential area for about 5 minutes. The light appeared to be rather large, perhaps 75-100 feet in diameter. It pulsed and changed brightness and moved slowly across the sky before disappearing. No other details are available. The sighting was reported to the police and Air Force.
