CASE NO. 10447

LOCATION: CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI 
DATE: JULY 23, 1941
TIME: 0230 HOURS

SUMMARY: AT APPROXIMATELY 0230 HOURS ON JULY 23, 1941, A LOCAL NEWSPAPER REPORTER AND TWO LOCAL POLICEMEN RESPONDED TO A CALL ABOUT A CRASHED FLYING OBJECT IN A FIELD NEAR CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI. UPON ARRIVAL, THEY DISCOVERED THE CRASHED OBJECT AND THREE HUMANOID CREATURES NEAR IT, TWO OF WHICH APPEARED TO BE DEAD. THE THIRD CREATURE WAS STILL ALIVE AND MAKING STRANGE SOUNDS. THE LIVE CREATURE WAS REMOVED FROM THE SCENE BY MILITARY PERSONNEL WHO ARRIVED SHORTLY AFTER. THE REPORTER AND POLICEMEN WERE SWORN TO SECRECY AND TOLD NOT TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT.

INVESTIGATION: DETAILS OF THIS CASE WERE PROVIDED BY THE NEWSPAPER REPORTER MANY YEARS LATER IN AN INTERVIEW. HIS ACCOUNT HAS BEEN CORROBORATED BY COLLATERAL EVIDENCE FROM OTHER SOURCES. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE MILITARY HAD REMOVED ALL TRACES OF THE CRASHED OBJECT AND THE DEAD CREATURES FROM THE SITE.

CONCLUSION: THIS INCIDENT APPEARS TO BE A GENUINE CASE OF A CRASHED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WITH HUMANOID OCCUPANTS. THE LIVE CREATURE WAS PRESUMABLY TAKEN BY THE MILITARY FOR FURTHER STUDY. THE REPORTER AND POLICEMEN WERE EFFECTIVELY SILENCED, NEVER PUBLICLY DISCLOSING THEIR OBSERVATIONS.
