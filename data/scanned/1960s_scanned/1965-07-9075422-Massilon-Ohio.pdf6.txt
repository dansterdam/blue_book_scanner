The text of the letter is as follows:

"Wednesday, July 17
Massillon, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

I am writing in regards to the flying saucer which many have seen over Tuscarawas County.

At approximately 9:40 A.M. on July 4th, I saw a saucer. It was hot and humid, and the object was bright, silvery and circular. The object was moving in a straight line and the U.F.O. was plainly visible, as it wasn't flying at a high altitude, but was flying rather fast.

I told my neighbors about it.

I also told father, who saw it myself on that same day.

Another man named Overton read about it in the newspaper and called me to say he also saw it that same day.

I wonder if you have any investigations about this occurrence.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]"
