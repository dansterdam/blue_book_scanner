PROJECT 10073 RECORD

2. LOCATION: Stewart Air Force Base, New York
10. CONCLUSION: Astroaaurius (sic) / First

CO1301. Sirius was on an azimuth of 137 degrees and at an elevation of approximately 17 degrees.

Observers watched a round multi-colored object in the sky. The object had alternately flashing red, green, and white. The alleged UFO appeared to be moving slowly back and forth over the base pond. The object did not disappear while it was under observation.

On a later evening the investigating officer had one of the witnesses identify the same body as in his original sighting, it being the star Sirius.
