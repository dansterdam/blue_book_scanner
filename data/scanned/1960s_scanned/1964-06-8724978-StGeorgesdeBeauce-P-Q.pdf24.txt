EVALUATION REPORT
ANALYSIS OF METAL AND RUBBER COMPONENTS
REPORT NO.: MAY 64-21
DATE: 17 September 1964
TYPE EVALUATION: SPEC NO: ITEM SERIAL NO:
PURPOSE: To analyze the various components and if possible, reconstruct and identify the whole item.
PHYSICAL DATA: 
1. The samples were received and assigned Analytical Branch Nos. 4-1239 - 1-344.  
2. 4 samples, 4-1239 to 4-1242 (see attached diagram) were analyzed and identified as follows:
4-1239 Phosphor Bronze
4-1240 Copper-Carbon Steel 
4-1241 Uranium Glass-Lead
4-1242 Low Carbon Steel
3. Sample 4-1243, a black rubberymaterial, was dissolved in benzene and filtered. The solvent was evaporated from the filtrate. An infrared spectrum of the insoluble portion showed the residue to be an inorganic silicate filler.
