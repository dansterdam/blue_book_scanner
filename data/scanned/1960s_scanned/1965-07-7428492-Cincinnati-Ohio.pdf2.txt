Dear Major Quintanilla,

On July 8, 1965 I sighted a "strange" object which passed in front of S.W. to NE. It looked almost like a "round ball" with a fuzzy trailing behind it. I am sure my type sighting. I believe the object was flying at a tremendous speed. Certainly much faster than any known aircraft. Therefore, I would like to report a sighting and I assume this will be of interest to you.

Thanking you in advance, I am
