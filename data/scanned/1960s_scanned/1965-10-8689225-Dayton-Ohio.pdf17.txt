There is no photograph present in the image provided. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with a form to be filled out. The text on the form includes:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 2 OCT 65
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The rest of the page is blank, presumably for the witness to provide additional information about their UFO sighting.
