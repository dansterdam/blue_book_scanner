"When sighting 8 July 1964 at 10:40 PM
at Clearwater, Florida.
(Witness - )
The witness stated that he was outside 
his residence with his wife, when they 
observed a large, round, luminous object 
in the sky. The object moved slowly in a 
northerly direction. It had a bright, 
gold-colored glow around the outer edge, 
and a bright, white center. There were no 
visible lights or wings. The witness 
stated that the object moved silently. 
After observing the object for several 
minutes, it suddenly accelerated and 
disappeared from sight.
The witness was certain that the object 
was not an aircraft, helicopter, or any 
known type of flying craft."
