Performing OCR on the text in the document:

The object was moving in a straight it was too high to estimate anything. 
I was looking at my models when the object came in to view. It was distinct and clear and did appear to be a light bulblike object and on one occasion remained on for a few minutes than it slowly disappeared. I had my telescope I could not see it very well.
