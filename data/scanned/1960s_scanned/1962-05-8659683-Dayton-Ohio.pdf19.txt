The image contains two sketches depicting UFO sightings. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the object's path across the sky, with an arrow pointing at the location of the object. The second sketch shows two side-by-side images - one depicting a larger view of the object in the sky, and the other showing a smaller sketch that is likely an example of the object's positioning.

Text extracted from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object appeared in the sky. Indicate how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete this larger sketch.
