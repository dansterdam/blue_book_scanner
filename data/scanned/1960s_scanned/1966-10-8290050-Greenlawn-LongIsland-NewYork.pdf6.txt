There does not appear to be any photograph present in the image. The image shows a handwritten document containing text that appears to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book UFO report. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

A leg strange thing about this sighting. It seems that in the past few weeks, we have seen - what appears to be - a bright light hovering for period of minutes at a time in the center part of the sky toward the east. This light is not a star, airplane or any other known object. Strange events take place. On Sunday October 30, 1966 at approx. 7:30 P.M. I was sitting watching TV, when another one of the strange lights appeared at a point east of the house. It held its position for about 10 minutes, then proceeded to move slowly in a northerly direction, very rapidly at first, then hovering again at a point north of the house. It continued this pattern for approx 30-40 minutes, when it finally faded from view.
I am absolutely sure this was not an airplane, satellite or any other known object. The object appeared to have a bluish white color, and it did not blink or have any flashing lights as would an aircraft. I have observed the object on 3 or 4 previous occasions, and it always follows the same general pattern. Apparently it is some type of unidentified flying object, or UFO. Please advise.
