The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record, which is a government program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the United States. The text on the page provides details about a sighting that occurred on 31 August 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. The sighting involved a balloon (hot air, garnet bag) that was observed for 10 minutes. The description states that the object looked about the size of a Ford tail light, and when it turned south, it looked like a foot-tall light with the light in front and a little above it. The light was yellow, and object just broke up and sent sparks coming from it.
