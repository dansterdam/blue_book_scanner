There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically an Air Intelligence Information Report.

Remarks: Possible correlation with aircraft on weather balloon and flight conditions could indicate distorted image and a normal situation, rather than any unusual aerial phenomenon.
