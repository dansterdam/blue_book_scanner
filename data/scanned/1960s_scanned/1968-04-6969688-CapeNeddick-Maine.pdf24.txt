SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING YOUR SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA (UAP). YOUR COOPERATION IN PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF SUCH REPORTS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE EACH ONE INDIVIDUALLY. HOWEVER, EACH REPORT IS CAREFULLY STUDIED. RETURN TO AIR FORCE BASE INVESTIGATOR FOR FORWARDING TO U.S.A.F. (ATTACH SECTIONS 1-7 OF THE REPORT FORM WITH YOUR NAME FOR IDENTIFICATION.)

1. WHEN DID YOU SEE THE PHENOMENON?
DAY: 16 MONTH: 4 YEAR: 1968

2. WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? HOUR: 11 MINUTE: 25 [A.M./P.M.]: A.M.

3. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON? HOUR: 11 MINUTE: 55 [A.M./P.M.]: A.M.

4. TIME ZONE: [CENTRAL/DAYLIGHT SAVINGS/MOUNTAIN/PACIFIC/OTHER]: STANDARD

5. WHAT DIRECTION WAS THE OBJECT FIRST SIGHTED AND IN WHAT PART OF THE SKY WAS IT LOCATED? WHERE WERE YOU STANDING WITH REFERENCE TO THE ADDRESS IF IN THE COUNTRY, IDENTIFY THE HIGHWAY YOU WERE ON OR NEAR AND TRY TO FIX A DISTANCE AND DIRECTION FROM SOME RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARK.
About 5 miles north of Portland, Maine on route 1A - about 3/5 miles southeast of York, Maine.

6. IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. PLACE AN "X" ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE OBJECT APPEARED ABOVE THE HORIZON (AT THE SAME ANGLE AT WHICH IT WAS FIRST SEEN). WHEN THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN, WAS IT HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THIS POINT ON THE SAME CURVED LINE.

The sketch shows a curved line likely representing the horizon, with an "X" mark on the line at around 60 degrees above the horizon. No other markings are present.
