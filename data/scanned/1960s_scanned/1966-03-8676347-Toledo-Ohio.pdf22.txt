The image shared does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document that describes an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) incident. The text describes the witnesses' observations, including that they saw a single craft that emitted bright lights and seemed to move against the wind. The document also mentions that the witnesses were asked if any air craft had been running, to which they responded that they had not seen any on Monday night. The text does not identify any individuals and instead refers to the witnesses in a general manner.
