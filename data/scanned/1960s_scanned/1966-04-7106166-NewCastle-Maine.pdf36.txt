UFO SUMMARY (4-27-66)
GROUP #3 (continued)
INVESTIGATION: Garold Vickery, New Castle, Maine. The object sighted suddenly disappeared in the fog. The object had been hovering and seemed to be approximately 100-150 feet off the ground before it suddenly and completely disappeared. The object was first sighted when it came into view through an opening in the fog. It could not be seen again.

CARGILLA (6:30 PM - 4/27/66)
Approx. 6:30 PM, Cargilla and her husband were outside. They saw an object in the sky, reddish in color and bright. It was moving rapidly in a southerly direction and then suddenly increased its speed and disappeared. The object was estimated to be about the size of a small airplane and made no sound. It was in view for about 3-4 seconds.

CARGILLA (9:00 PM 4/27 - Abington)
A couple from Abington, Ma. were driving along a main highway and saw something in the sky to the southeast, overhead, straight and level. It then started to change direction and was observed for about 2 minutes. The object was described as an unusual size of light, much larger than a star. It had a reddish-orange color and did not have any trailing or exhaust of any kind. The object finally accelerated and disappeared.

EVALUATION: The sighting was not a flying aircraft. The NASA plane was not flying at this time. The sighting appears to be legitimate and the observers appeared reliable and sincere. However, there is insufficient data to determine the nature of the object reported.

Respectfully submitted,
