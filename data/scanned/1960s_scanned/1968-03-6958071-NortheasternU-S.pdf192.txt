Dear Col. Quintanilla:

The enclosed copy of the paper "Prepared at Wright-Patterson and traced on a revised date", submitted on March 6, 1968, makes the meaning clearer; I do not know whether my name should be inserted as author. I have passed on a copy of the letter, as I am leaving my position. There is one matter I left alone that I will state further. When I am treating them as persons so legal books. I hope I shall not see them again and that we shall wait a reply. American and keep roll with the English, which I consider more American, in relation to their writing so far superior to over ours. The two editors I put this idea across. But the next one I invited on India interrupted me, and this is not clear and I drifted.

However, I wish that I follow American custom in the matter, and as they had changed my capitals to small letters, I shall continue to do so. Please do not send me any more country data, as I do not think it is worth while to do more of them.

Kindly sent me this date, as you kindly wrote. I received it July 2; fireballist, and while it is dated Continental, I hope to be completed in the near future. Your cooperation in sending fireballist data has now in many cases permitted the solution of their paths and orbits. I write to tell the continuance to me benefits.

Very sincerely yours,
