The image does not contain any photographs, only a sketch and text. The sketch shows an illustration of a horizon with markings indicating the elevation and direction of an observed object relative to the observer.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the scale where you last saw the object.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
