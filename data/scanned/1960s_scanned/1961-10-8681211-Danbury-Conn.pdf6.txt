The image does not contain any photographs. It contains two sketches illustrating different scenarios related to how high an object was above the horizon when first seen. The sketches show the curved line of the horizon and the relative position of an object at point "A" and "B".

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
