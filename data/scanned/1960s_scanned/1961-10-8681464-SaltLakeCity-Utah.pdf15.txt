The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned document or typewritten text. The text appears to be part of an investigation report on an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

Now with regard to this investigation on Unidentified Flying Objects would you give your name please?
And what was your address?
And your occupation?
I work here at the airport.
Is that a mechanic?
No, just taking care of the aircraft.
Do you have a pilot's license?
Yes, I do.
About how many hours flying time do you have?
About 55.
With regard to this object, about how long did you watch it?
I would say that before it went out of sight, about 15 minutes.
Would you describe the shape?
It was too far away to see the shape. I could see it glisten. It was silver and as would go out of sight then it would come back and the ship would shine on it again and we would see it for 2 or 3 minutes and then it would go out of sight again.
Then you couldn't compare the size to any known object?
No, I couldn't, because the size, but as I say it must have been awful big because it couldn't have been any large aircraft because you can only see an aircraft at that distance if it was approximately over Provo Canyon in the mountain range out there.
You say approximately 30 miles?
I would say approximately 30 miles.
And you wouldn't have any idea as to color?
All I could see was that it was silver. I didn't look through the binoculars, but I could see it very distinctly.
