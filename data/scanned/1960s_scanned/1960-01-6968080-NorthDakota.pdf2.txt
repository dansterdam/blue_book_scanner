SUBJECT: Extract from ATIC Duty Officer's Report

13 January 1960

FOR ATIC-48

The following is an extract from an ATIC Duty Officer's report:

1952 - Received a UFO report: On 001, Village 24 Cranswick, near Horneymoor a "most Russian warfare" light in sky was observed. This light was observed from Colt Bridge, also a 1957 from Gott house, Octi at a pressure 6 miles high.

FLASH INDICATIONS - Directly from the observer, a red glow was observed which appeared directly overhead and caused a flashlike indication, observed by witness. The observer believes this was some kind of scanning radar - its period of flash indicated 15 seconds or less. This is believed to be of special interest as it may reveal possibilities of scanning radar or other equipment installed in craft.

Further, the observer stated that he had called the Air Force and talked to a harassed-sounding officer who told him he would not be called back. The witness stated that he has not been contacted since, although the incident was reported.

It is recommended that if this case is of interest, further investigation along the lines of the scanning radar or other equipment be carried out. This case was considered as recommended by Maj. Friand, USAF UFO officer.
