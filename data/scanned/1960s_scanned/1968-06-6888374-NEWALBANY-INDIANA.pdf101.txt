35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

We were sitting and talking on the porch of our home, about 10:30 on a warm evening. Suddenly we saw an object high in the sky in the east, moving rapidly from north to south and getting brighter and larger. As it neared the horizon, it became very bright and lit up the sky around it. Just before it passed below the horizon, it appeared to break up and disappear. It was at high altitude and we could see no wings or any other structural details.

I can not tell what it was, but it was a strange and unusual sight, one that I had never seen before. But I felt a kind of unexplainable dread in my heart, because it was so unexpected.
