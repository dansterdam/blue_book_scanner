The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter or report from Project Blue Book.

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Dear ******,

I am returning herewith the color slides you furnished through the Ohio State University to the Air Materiel Command Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The accompanying report analyzes these slides and concludes they were unidentified flying objects.

The color slides have been analyzed and the following represents conclusions of ATIC:

a. The slides are of the Mars terrain area of unknown location.
b. Only one slide contains anything unusual. Several spots are immediately obvious on the slide in question (the bluest spot) and is the most anomalous spot.
c. It is the opinion of the photographic experts that these spots are areas which were not reached by the camera during the filming process. These areas are not contaminated by some foreign substance as was first thought. The foreign substance contamination is ruled out.
Therefore it is the Air Force's opinion that the slides on this side are not from Mars but were taken of the terrain near Grand Blanc, Michigan.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
