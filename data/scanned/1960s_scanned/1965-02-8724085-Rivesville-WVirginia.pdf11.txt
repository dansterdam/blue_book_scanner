AF Balloon
Sets Record
The largest balloons ever launched in
the United States achieved a successful flight at 17 when the Air Force recovered a 
balloon which had reached the record
altitude of 113,740 feet, the Air Force announced.
The previous U.S. record for a single
balloon flight was 106,000 feet.
The mammoth 3.3 million-cubic-
foot balloon was launched Feb 16
from a permanent field station at
Chico, Calif. It was designed to explore
the upper atmosphere and to test
instruments and equipment for use in
future balloon flights.
Arthur Kern of the APCRL was
responsible for the flight. The balloon
carried a 5-foot, 6-inch steel sphere, a
load of scientific instruments.
