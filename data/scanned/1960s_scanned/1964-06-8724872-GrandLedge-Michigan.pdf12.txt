I MUST APOLOGIZE FOR NOT WRITING SOONER. I HAVE BEEN SO BUSY THAT I HAVE JUST NOT HAD A CHANCE TO WRITE TO YOU ABOUT YOUR SIGHTING.

YOUR SIGHTING WAS SO INTRIGUING THAT I MUST SURELY OWE YOU SOME EXPLANATION. REGARDING SUCH SIGHTINGS I OBTAINED THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF THE SIGHTING WITH YOU I OBTAINED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

ESSENTIALLY, THE REASON FOR THIS SIGHTING IS AS FOLLOWS: WHILE IT SEEMS TO REPRESENT A VERY UNUSUAL PHENOMENON, IT MUST BE EXPLAINED IN NATURAL TERMS. ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT IT WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY SWAMP GAS OR SOME SUCH NATURAL PHENOMENON.

YOUR CAR FROM THE DRIVEWAY INTO THE ROAD AND THE LIGHTS STOPPED UPON A BRANCH OR POWER LINE OR SOMETHING SIMILAR. WHEN YOUR CAR MOVED, THE LIGHTS DISAPPEARED. IT WOULD NATURALLY BE THAT OF A CAR COMING TOWARD YOU DOWN THE ROAD. HOWEVER, A CLOSER EXAMINATION WOULD SHOW IT WAS (SIMPLY) YOUR OWN CAR AND LIGHTS.

I HOPE THAT THIS EXPLANATION IS SATISFACTORY AND THAT THE WEATHER WOULD NOT CHANGE BUT WOULD REMAIN THE SAME. I WAS SO LONG AGO THE SAME.

SINCERELY YOURS,
[REDACTED]
