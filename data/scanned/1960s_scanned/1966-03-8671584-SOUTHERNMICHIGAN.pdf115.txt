PAUL MAST, COLUMBUS DISPATCH - UFOs in Columbus area would be reported to Lockbourne APS. I am the Blue Book officer for the whole Air Force. Call the Air Force base nearest you and ask for the UFO officer when reporting a sighting. We have had a rash of sightings due to publicity and the onslaught of spring. Gave general information on the UFO program.

CALLS OF 29 MARCH 1966:
JIM MORGAN - Wanted to know if Major Quintanilla went to Michigan. No I didn't. Dr Hynek, Moody and Ann Elmer went. Mostly said that it was in the New York Journal by Lloyd Young that Hynek did not want to give the answer about the gas, that there was a violent argument between Hynek and Major Quintanilla. We informed him that it was Dr Hynek who suggested marsh gas. We talked to a shendit who had talked to others up there. He had an idea Thursday afternoon but we couldn't say anything until it was thoroughly checked out. We agreed Friday morning. I have never met Mr. Young. Spoke on the current sightings to WSAZ.

WILLIAMS, ELYRIA, OHIO - wanted to know if Major Quintanilla would be available to speak. This information is in going to be really and I would like to hear your request but we are very busy. Will do it for one person. I must do it for all. Major explained the project to date, etc.
