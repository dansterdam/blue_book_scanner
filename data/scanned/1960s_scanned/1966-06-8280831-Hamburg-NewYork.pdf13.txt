Below is the text from the handwritten document:

For a period of nearly 2 years the object has been observed over this area. It is about the size of a half dollar and has been seen at all hours of the day and night, hovering at varying altitudes from a few hundred feet to several thousand feet. The object is silvery in appearance and has been described as round, oval and disc-shaped. On several occasions it has been seen to leave the area at high speed, only to return a short time later. The object gives off no sound and leaves no trail. One observer watched it move across the sky at an estimated speed of over 1000 mph without making any sound.
