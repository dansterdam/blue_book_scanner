The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a handwritten document or note. The document page is mostly blank, with a single vertical line drawn on the right side. Below the line, there is handwritten text that appears to be a description or commentary about something, though the exact content is unclear from the image alone.

Text from the document:

The line of demarcation is quite obvious and stands out in sharp contra5c to the background surface. The motion of the object was very rapid - so rapid that it could not be followed by the eye. The object was maneuverable and changed direction more than once during its flight. There was no engine noise or any other sound associated with the object.
