REPORT ON SIGHTING OF OBJECTS OBSERVED

DEAR SIR:

I AM WRITING IN REFERENCE TO AN ARTICLE THAT APPEARED IN THE ST. LOUIS GLOBE DEMOCRAT, GAS-CONTAINING, THIS DATE, REGARDING AN OBSERVATION I MADE DURING THE EVENING OF MARCH 8, 1955 IN THE ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI AREA.

I WAS REVIEW AN OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE A LARGE DISC, HOVERING ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND SOME 200 YARDS FROM OUR HOME. THE OBJECT WAS BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AND WAS VISIBLE FOR ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE DAYS. I DISCUSSED THIS OBSERVATION WITH MY WIFE AND SEVERAL OF OUR NEIGHBORS, ALL OF WHOM SAW THE OBJECT.

I AM A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER AND MY WIFE IS A REGISTERED NURSE. ALTHOUGH I HAVE GIVEN SOME THOUGHT TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT WHAT WE SAW COULD HAVE BEEN SOME TYPE OF AIRCRAFT, I AM CONVINCED THAT IT WAS NEITHER A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT NOR A WEATHER BALLOON. THE OBJECT WAS SILENT, DID NOT HAVE ANY VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION, AND APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY, HOVERING ABOVE THE GROUND. ALSO, IT DID NOT CONFORM TO THE USUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EITHER AIRCRAFT OR BALLOONS.

I WOULD BE MOST INTERESTED IN HAVING SOMEONE INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER FURTHER. IF YOU DESIRE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

VERY TRULY YOURS,
[SIGNATURE REDACTED]
