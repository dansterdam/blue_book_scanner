Dear Sirs,

A most interesting letter has come to my attention in the past few days concerning an observation made on the evening of August 6. This observation was made by 2 adults and 3 children who were apparently standing in their yard and observing unusual activity in the sky over Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.

According to the information received, these observers spotted what they described as a large circular object, approximately 75 to 100 feet in diameter, that was maneuvering in the sky at a relatively low altitude. The object was reported to be emitting a bright light that illuminated the surrounding area. It was stated that the object made several passes over the observers before ascending rapidly and disappearing from view.

I believe this incident warrants further investigation, and I would appreciate it if you could provide any additional details or documentation that may be available regarding this sighting. Any assistance you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
