The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire with questions about an observed object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes     No     Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes     No     Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what was in front of it.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound ___ 
b. Color ___ 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and see how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object could have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you are such as size, proportions, etc., and especially outline results of vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
