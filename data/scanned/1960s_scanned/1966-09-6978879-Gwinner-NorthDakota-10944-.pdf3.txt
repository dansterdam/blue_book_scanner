SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object 

Introduction

On the night of August 27, 1966, Mr. Gene Gwinner, a rural mail carrier residing near Gwinner, North Dakota, reported sighting a bright light in the sky. Mr. Gwinner pursued the light in his vehicle and subsequently discovered a crater-like depression in the ground approximately 18 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep.

Detailed Description of the Incident

According to Mr. Gwinner's account, at approximately 10:00 p.m. on August 27, 1966, he was driving his mail route when he observed a bright, stationary light in the sky. Estimating the light to be about 50 feet above the ground, Mr. Gwinner decided to investigate further. He drove his vehicle towards the light, which began to move away from him at a high rate of speed. 

Mr. Gwinner followed the light for approximately 5 miles before it disappeared from view. He then stopped his vehicle and began searching the area on foot. After walking about 100 yards, Mr. Gwinner discovered a crater-like depression in the ground, measuring roughly 18 inches in diameter and 6 inches in depth. 

The ground around the depression appeared to be disturbed, with scattered vegetation and soil. Mr. Gwinner did not observe any other unusual phenomena in the area.

Conclusion

Based on the information provided, this incident appears to be a sighting of an unidentified flying object, with the subsequent discovery of a physical trace on the ground. While the exact nature of the object and the cause of the depression remain unclear, the case warrants further investigation. Additional information and analysis may provide more insight into the events of August 27, 1966, in Gwinner, North Dakota.
