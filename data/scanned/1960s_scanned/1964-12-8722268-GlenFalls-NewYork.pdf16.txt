SIGHTING BY CANADIAN RANGER

On Dec 11, 1964, an unknown flying object with four equally spaced lights was sighted over British Columbia, Canada, by a Canadian ranger. Y. D. Dale, the ranger, reported this sighting to the R.C.M.P.

At first the lights would be coming towards them, and then the lights of the object would be swung around and the object would be going away from them. The lights appeared to be perfectly round, equally spaced, and pale yellow in colour.

When first observed, the object was about overhead, and seemed to be going at a high rate of speed, He then saw the object make a sharp turn and disappear behind a cloud.

The sighting was reported by the ranger to the R.C.M.P. Port Alberni office, and they in turn notified the air force by the quickest method. They checked with the airport and learned that no aircraft were reported in the vicinity.
