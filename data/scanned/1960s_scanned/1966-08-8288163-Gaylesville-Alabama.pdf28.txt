Text from the document:

NOV 29 1967

Dear [Redacted],

This will reply to your letter of November 5, 1967, whereby you reported sometime ago.

Your report on the sighting of your UFO sighting that you identified was that only this particular incident was called to our attention. You submitted particulars and it was established as the case, but it would appear as the only known objects observable in the area at the time.

Should you ever sight again significant UFO objects in the area, I will appreciate it if you will immediately report it through your force public information office, if any. We will conduct the UFO investigation and report the finding.

We hope the enclosed project blue book report will be of interest. Thank you for your interest in the Air Force UFO program.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Commander of Information
