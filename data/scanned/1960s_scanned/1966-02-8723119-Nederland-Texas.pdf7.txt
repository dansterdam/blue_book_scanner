ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION
29 June 1966

1. Lt. Marley, Project Blue Book, Wright-Patterson AFB, called this date and requested further investigation on balloon launching's to determine if this sighting could be forwarded either by phone or letter.

2. Investigation revealed that no weather balloons were released by the National Weather Bureau (NWB) on the date in question. This information was provided by the Weather Bureau because they thought Lake Charles released high altitude weather balloons about the time in question.

3. Mr. Richards of the Lake Charles Weather Bureau was contacted by phone (31-477-6371) and stated that no weather balloons were released by them other than April 1966 because they were all forwarded to the National Weather Records Center. Although no records were available all indicate that no weather balloon was released at approximately 7:00 P.M. or 6:25 P.M. as stated. The diameter was approximately 6 feet and it stated the its diameter was approximately 5 ft. NWB information indicated a strong surface wind at the time of release and the balloon did not achieve a maximum altitude of approximately 1,000 feet per minute and that winds have very little effect on the rate of climb.

4. Mr. Haggard, Director of the National Weather Records Center, Asheville, N.C. was contacted by letter, all information that his Center has on the release of the balloon in question. Mr. Haggard stated he would see that this was accomplished as soon as possible.

5. Observations made from a map indicate that the UFO sighting location is approximately 52 nautical miles from Lake Charles, La. on an azimuth of 42 degrees.
