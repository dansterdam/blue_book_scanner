There is a photograph or diagram present in the image. The diagram appears to be an illustration used in a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The diagram shows a compass with instructions for the viewer to imagine and draw certain things related to the sighting of an unidentified object.

Transcribed text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "B" on the high point of the object you first saw. Place a "G" on the same curved line to show where the object (B) was when you first saw it. Place a "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
