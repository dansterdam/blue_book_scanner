STATEMENT
INTERVIEWING NCO: Earl W. Schroeder, Sgt. USAF
Niagara Falls International Airport
Niagara Falls, New York 14306

After carefully analyzing the facts as told to us by the people in this case, this statement from personal observation of the people and the situation, this could very well be a hoax connected by two of the principal persons involved, and I have reason to believe the saw the thing - that is in my opinion, and as such I do not believe the whole thing.

Being a native of this area and having spent a good share of my life training and raining in this area, I believe that the so called "monster" (if there was such) could very well have been a large black bear. Some of the facts that bring me to this conclusion are as follows:

1. All four principals involved stated it was a clear night in the sky. There was no mention of the moon which in 31 July 1966 was full.

2. During the week of 26 July the local TV stations showed a presubstantial black bear which was captured near this area. This makes me think that a black bear could very well have been in this area at the time of this incident.

3. Things that were observed were consistently absent during the incident and may have augmented by hasty or limited observation.

4. When first observed, as she states "monster", she could very well have seen a large black bear which at that distance and time of night could have been mistaken for something unusual.

5. He stated that he knew the beach and beach area very well, he could have very well recognized a black bear at that distance and those minutes and the distance between Jamestown and the beach is approximate 30 miles.

6. The only persons whose statements agree on exact times of the two disappearances of the vehicle is the two are boy and girl-friend.
