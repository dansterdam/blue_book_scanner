UFO OBSERVATIONS

Headquarters Foreign Technology Division (Col. James C. Manadtl) Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 4.4333

1. We are in receipt of two UFO letters and photos that may be of interest to you. Due to the delay of these observations and the area covered we feel it is too late for an interview with the individuals concerned.

2. Major Ross was personally interviewed by Major Ross, approximately a year ago. He stated that he had taken some observations or officer stations at that time but were of the same quality as the photos included so they were returned to him. There was no action taken.

3. If you feel additional information is needed I shall be only too happy to help in any way possible.
