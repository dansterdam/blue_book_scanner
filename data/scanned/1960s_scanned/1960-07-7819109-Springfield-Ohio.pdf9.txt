Dear sir:

Last year I wrote to you concerning a U.F.O. sighting which occurred approximately one year ago on Friday, July 17, 1959. At that time I said that I would send a sketch of the object seen. However, I have not done so until now. I hope I am not too late.

The object was approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter, oval in shape and silver-white in color. It was traveling at a rapid rate of speed, and made no sound that I could hear. The sighting lasted for approximately one minute. 

I am enclosing a rough sketch of what was seen.

I hope this information is helpful. 

Yours truly,
