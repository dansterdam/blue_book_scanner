Report No. 148
Washington 25, D.C.
Dear Sirs,

On the evening of 28 June 1964 at approximately 8:40 p.m. CST, I was standing in my backyard observing the night sky when I saw a disc-shaped object hovering above the treeline approximately 500 yards away. The object was silvery-white in color and was approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. It appeared to be rotating slowly and was making a faint humming sound.

The object remained stationary for approximately 2-3 minutes, after which it suddenly accelerated upward at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view in a matter of seconds. I observed no exhaust or trail of any kind as the object ascended. 

After the object disappeared, I immediately called the local police department to report the sighting. I was subsequently interviewed by an officer from the Air Force's Project Blue Book, but no further action was taken.

I am a 42-year-old male with no history of mental illness or drug/alcohol abuse. I have 20/20 vision and was sober at the time of the incident. I have never had a similar experience before and have no reason to fabricate this report.

I hope this information is of use to your investigation. Please let me know if you require any additional details.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
