The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs, but there are handwritten responses to various questions related to the observed object.

The transcribed text from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes - that's why I said I don't think it was a plane or anything else known. It just disappeared. I watched it go up and back down again, and then it just vanished - poof - that's why I called it a "spacecraft". 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes □ No √ Don't Know □. IF you answered "Yes", say what it moved behind: //

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes □ No □ Don't Know √. IF you answered "Yes", say what it moved in front of: //

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: 
a. Size: The approximate size of the craft was about the size of a helicopter. 
c. Color: The craft glew an ever changing color, a very bright phosphorescent light that seemed to pulsate or flicker.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. If you have performed this experiment, indicate how much of the object is covered by the match head.
Not sure of the exact angular size but it seemed about the size of a helicopter in the sky. It was not a tiny point of light, but a good sized craft.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Include such things as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails.
An arrow indicates the direction the object was moving. The craft had no wings or obvious exhaust or propulsion system. It seemed to just float silently and then disappear.
