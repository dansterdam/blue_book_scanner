Brenda was called outside by her two brothers to see a "Flying Saucer". She saw the back of the craft with the brothers when the large star move slowly then stop at approximately 20 degrees down range. After about 15 minutes it took off at a fast rate of speed and gone in 2 seconds. She compared the object with another large star near by and it was more pronounced. This object remained in the position for approx. 1 minute 15 degrees jet the sewer appeared. And where is 13 degrees past at the near caboose as subject she 1.43 degrees jet. When this Jet the first time about 16 times as long as lasting which remained constant heart sharp never charged as it twice across the sky at 2.6 seconds.   No on seen moving directly toward the saucer before the jet gone by. Attention is now attract to a spectrographic set.    The sky had a reddish cast glow with a white haze spread around it.  Red clouds appeared to be 1/2 down around it but not as a bright as a light. The red gag appeared to be colder than the white. She did not to darker, the moon somewat and cover the stars it the area. In the light haze in the spot where the sighting happened the main object was stationary for a long dark gray and shape clear where of cloud. The band was solid fox full moon with the ends sightless light points about the size of a regular star. All agree at the time.
