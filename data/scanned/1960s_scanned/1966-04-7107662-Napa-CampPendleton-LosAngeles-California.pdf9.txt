The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a handwritten document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

Reliably and distinctly on the date 16 April 
1966 an unknown luminous object was observed in the sky over the Camp Pendleton area in California. The object was described as being elliptical in shape and emitting a steady light. It was observed at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet and at a distance of an estimated 15 to 20 miles. The object remained stationary for approximately 10 minutes, then moved in a north-westerly direction at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.
