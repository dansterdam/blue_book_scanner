The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is a photograph on the left side of the page, which appears to be a diagram or sketch showing the directions and movement of an unidentified object.

The text in the image is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the course line to show how high the object was. Place an "N" on the compass to show where the object first came into view. If there is a "B" on the course line, place it where you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.

The text and diagram appear to provide instructions for observers to record their observations of unidentified flying objects, including their location, direction of movement, and number of objects observed.
