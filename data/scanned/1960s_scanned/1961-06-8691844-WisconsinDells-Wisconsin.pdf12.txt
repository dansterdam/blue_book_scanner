WISCONSIN DELLS OF JUNE 1961 CASE $419
CAPTAIN D.L. HANAVIN, USAF RESERVE
On 8 June 1961, while on weekend reserve training duty at Truax Field, Madison, Wisconsin, I was contacted by the Wisconsin State Patrol, who requested Air Force assistance in investigating a reported UFO sighting near Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin.

Upon arrival at the scene, I interviewed the principal witness, Mr. X, who stated that at approximately 1:15 AM on 8 June 1961 he and two companions were traveling in a car on Highway 13 south of the Wisconsin Dells when they observed a large, oval-shaped, luminescent object hovering over the highway approximately 300 feet ahead of their vehicle. The object, estimated to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter, emitted a bright, pulsating white light which illuminated the surrounding countryside.

As the car approached the object, it suddenly ascended at a rapid rate of speed and disappeared from view. The total observation time was approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Mr. X stated that the object appeared to be solid and metallic in construction and that it moved without any apparent means of propulsion.

Several other minor witnesses were interviewed, but their descriptions of the object were essentially similar to Mr. X's account. No physical evidence was found at the scene. Air Force personnel conducted a thorough search of the area, but no traces of the object were discovered.

This case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED.
