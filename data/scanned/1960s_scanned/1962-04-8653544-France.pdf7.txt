"Gentlemen:

I am writing the year of sightings with a sighting witnessed by myself.  I believe in flying saucers and I am in agreement in the "Project Blue Book."

I am reporting to you that on Tuesday, the 24th of April, French time - 4:15, a companion and I noticed a strange lighting phenomenon in the sky. 

It was a spheric luminous object, which appeared at a great height, traveling in a straight line.  The size of a yellowish light, appeared distinctly to fade out and then light up again irregularly.

As closely confinement, the object moved in various fashion, in any direction.

We came up with different hypotheses:

Could it be an airplane? No, as airplanes have several lights.
An artificial satellite? No, because a satellite does not appear and disappear like that.
A weather balloon? No, because a balloon does not light up and fade out intermittently.
An artificial satellite? No, because a satellite goes straight.
A shooting star? A shooting star also has a rectilinear trajectory, and a moving star does not light up again.

According to the children, this phenomenon was really strange.

If you think that this is what it was, will you let us know about it? (The address is on the back of the letter.) If you think that it is something else, will you let us know?

Thank you."
