PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 14 JUL 60
2. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local
3. GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES: Marietta & Dundannon, Pennsylvania
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: G. Ground-Radar
5. EQUIPMENT: G. Ground-Radar, Civilian
6. SOURCE: G. Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 minute
10. CHIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Through an alert radar this object was tracked, and radar tracing showed an object moved from left to right at an estimated speed of 10 miles per minute. When object reached a point 10 miles north of the observers it appeared to accelerate and disappeared from the radar scope.
11. COMMENTS: Considered unusual for the equipment involved. Brightness or these echoes seem to indicate that this object was comparable to aircraft metal in reflecting area. This has remained an unidentified flying object, especially as to the judgment of distance being critical as the echoes were so unusual in characteristics of a meteor or aircraft.
