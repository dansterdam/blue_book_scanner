7/26-27/67 - NEWTON, N.J. 

NAME: POSSIBLE SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR THIS SIGHTING

On 7/30/67 I received a phone call from Mr. Paul Muser, Superintendent of the New England Military School on air base in Newton, Massachusetts. He said that on 7/26 and 7/27/67 they observed a bright light in the sky like a searchlight beam which seemed to be at a high altitude. The light would dim and then brighten again. This happened several times. He checked doors, etc. before retiring when he heard a loud scratching noise on the outside screens. He looked out the windows and saw nothing. The next day the same thing occurred again. He looked out the windows and saw nothing so rushed outside. He then spotted the light in the sky which he described as clear, then suddenly dim down like a dying campfire, then brighten up again rather quickly. This occurred several times. 

The document then goes on to discuss reported phone calls from residents north of Boston concerning a weird humming sound and strange activities, as well as local law enforcement investigating the incident. It also mentions an orange glow being observed in the sky during the sighting. The report concludes by stating that the incident seems to be of the increase in this area, and that the sighting was apparently observed by many and is worthy of investigation.
