The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document discusses the receipt and handling of some color film that was forwarded to the center for analysis, but the analysis could not find anything on the film itself.

The text in the document is as follows:

LT LCDR L. H. England AFB, La, 11 Apr 60, Film of UFO
Int EX CAPTAIN) ,ASAF) FRIEND(SAME) 20 Apr 60
Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio
1. Attached is the roll of 8mm color film forwarded to this center for analysis.
2. The PHOTO ANALYSIS section could not find anything on the film which fit the description given by the witness.
3. It is suggested that the film be examined at the frames which received the initial indication of some unusual object for which the film was forwarded. It may be that any significant observation would have to be made on one or more of these initial frames.
