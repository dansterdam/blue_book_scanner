The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was the United States Air Force's official program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page appears to be a handwritten response to a questionnaire or form. The text discusses some details about a UFO sighting, including the observer's account and the lack of adequate coverage of certain aspects in the specific points of the questionnaire.

On the night of September 22, 1965 at about 9:30 pm I observed a moving object with a flashing light in the southern sky as I was driving home on the Capitol Beltway. The object appeared to be at a high altitude and was moving at a very rapid rate. I watched it for a period of several minutes as it proceeded on a northerly course and then appeared to stop and hover for a short time. It then accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared from view. The object did not appear to be an aircraft or satellite and did not have the characteristics of either. Since the U.S.O. system cannot yet explain this sighting, I would be very interested to know if there have been any other similar sightings in the area on or about the same time.
