This image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report. The document describes an incident where no abnormal objects were observed on search or height finder radars, but the object seemed to be traveling at a higher rate of speed than previous objects observed. The document indicates that preliminary investigations were unable to identify these sightings with known air traffic or weather phenomena, and there were no physical effects to study. The document also notes the "existence of physical evidence" is "none" and refers to Section I of AF In 38297 (2 Feb 65).
