February 14, 1964

Dear Mrs. xxxxxx,

This is in reply to your letter of February 11, 1964, which concerned the unusual phenomena you described.

In our letter we quoted Dr. Menzel's book "The World of Flying Saucers" in describing this phenomena. Dr. Menzel stated that these need be clouds. What he said was that "a thin layer of ice crystals may be invisible to the observer while reflecting a luminous and temporary image."

In our letter we also mentioned that "sundog" phenomena, which are caused by the refraction of light in the atmosphere, can sometimes appear as the one you witnessed. Also, "sundogs" appear in various colors of the spectrum and usually near the sun.

The phenomena pictured in the sketch you enclosed does not appear to be explained by either of these atmospheric phenomena. There was a bright spot about 15 to 20 degrees from the horizon, where the material was of a nature that we cannot determine.

Sincerely,
