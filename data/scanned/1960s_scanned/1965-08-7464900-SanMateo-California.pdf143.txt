There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. The image shows a handwritten response to a questionnaire from the "Official U.S. Air Force" dated 16 Feb 1967.

The text in the document says:

"I think you should have Ask what was my first reaction. 

At first I thought it was a plane, but it stop for about 10 sec then rose.

I would like to know if my information has helped."
