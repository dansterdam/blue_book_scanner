The text in the document reads as follows:

Sirs:
I would like to report a sighting of a strange object. It was sighted on the night of April 26, 1967 at about 9:30 P.M. It was [illegible] about 30 degrees above the horizon. When first sighted it appeared to be a light, but upon closer observation it seemed to be a definite object, larger than a bright planet or star. It remained the same size and color, a sort of amber or reddish color, for about 3 minutes. Again it turned to the amber color. It seemed to grow in size until it was about 20 degrees across. The object then seemed to diminish in size until it was just a star or planet again. It then disappeared. My landlord, a 76 year old man, witnessed the same sight. It appeared to be traveling towards the south and started and stopped, seeming to hover. I am a minister and a reliable person. I would appreciate your investigation of this matter. I am available for further information if desired.
Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
