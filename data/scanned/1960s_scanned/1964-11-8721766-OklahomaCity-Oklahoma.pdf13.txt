The group interested with an Oklahoma City police station official reported they had 'Unidentified Flying Objects' in the area. The investigation of the sightings was conducted to searchplanes near the area on which the objects were found.
FIERY CINDERS - UNIQUE FIND?   
'Fiery cindery mass'- only about the size of a softball - has attracted wide attention, but Army experts say it's really nothing to get excited about. The object is currently in possession of Olin F. Shults, of 8301 N.W. 34th Terrace, Oklahoma City, who found it on his patio last Friday night. Shults says it could be a meteorite. He says it fell from the sky about midnight last Thursday and struck his patio with a thud, shattering into several fragments.
However, Air Force experts who have examined it at the Oklahoma City Air Defense Command Radar Station say it is unlikely the object is a meteorite. It appears to be a different phenomenon, although just what it is remains a mystery.
It is an estimated 500 degree hotter than a normal house temperature, and it still has not cooled as much as expected, according to the Air Force experts. They are unable to identify it or say where it came from.
In the meantime, other witnesses reported seeing a mysterious glow in the sky Thursday night near Shults' home, and another reported seeing a flamelike object in the southwestern sky about 8 p.m. the same night. The Air Force is investigating these sightings, but has not been able to determine their exact nature.'
