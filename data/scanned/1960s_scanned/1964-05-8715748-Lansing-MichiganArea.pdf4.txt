PROJECT BLUE BOOK SUMMARY REPORT

Hughes, a about witch appears on the left of complainants (not in chronological order) from Wednesday night, and which should be checked as possibly indicate respects. Complainant desires to know whac further reports, if any. Saturday the caller called before making this report was received 4:00 pm. Mrs. Donna Polkis, in response to my request for any additional information. Lansing, Michigan. She stated that she had observed that a "large brown mass" appeared quise willine to cooperate, and individuals seem to show a healthy mixture of interest and skepticism. My impression is that a more detailed reading of the logs and reports with examination of photographs (or physical evidence if any) will eliminate the bulk of reports concerned with noises only, but that other events appear to have occurred which require more detailed investigation and probably will call for several different types of inquiries. Agencies and individuals appearing to take a like interest in these reports, this is a very abbreviated list, and is given only for the purpose of aiding identification of the proper log pages or proper individuals with whom to communicate.
