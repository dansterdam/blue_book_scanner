Four college students saw a group of bright luminous circular objects traveling at tremendous speed over Lake Michigan on April 17, 1963. They observed the objects for about 3 hours and 5 minutes. The objects appeared to be about 40 feet in diameter and glowed with a bluish-white light. When investigated, the incident was determined to be "saucers" themselves, according to the witnesses.
