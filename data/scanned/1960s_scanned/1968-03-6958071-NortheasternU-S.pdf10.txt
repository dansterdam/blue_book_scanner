27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATELY, PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING:
The sighting I saw occurred on March 21, 1968 between 17:53 and 18:02 hours in the vicinity of Northeastem University, Boston, Massachusetts. The object was first noticed by a fellow student who called my attention to it. I then observed the object for approximately 9 minutes.
The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball at arm's length, oval in shape, with a silvery metallic exterior. It was observed to be hovering stationary at an estimated altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet. No wings, fins, or other appendages were visible.
The object appeared to be emitting a fluorescent glow which seemed to pulse or fluctuate at an irregular rate. During my observation, the object remained stationary and did not move from its original position in the sky. There was no sound or trail associated with the object.
At one point during the sighting, the object appeared to be surrounded by a faint halo or "corona" which was visible for a brief period.
The object eventually disappeared from view, apparently by simply fading out or becoming obscured, I do not know which. There were at least 4 or 5 other witnesses to this sighting, all of whom were fellow students in the area at the time.
I feel that this sighting represents a genuine unidentified flying object, as the object displayed characteristics not consistent with any conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon that I am aware of. The behavior and appearance of the object was very strange and unlike anything I have ever seen before or since. I can find no rational explanation for what I observed that day.
