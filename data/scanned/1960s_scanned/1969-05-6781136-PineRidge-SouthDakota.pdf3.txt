To whom it may concern:

On the evening of May 6, 1969 at approximately 7:20 P.M. mountain standard time, I was driving west on Interstate Highway 90 approximately 10 miles east of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The weather was clear and visibility was good. As I was driving along I suddenly observed a bright light in the sky directly in front of me. At first I thought it might be an aircraft, but as I continued to observe it, I realized that it was not an aircraft, but some type of unidentified flying object. 

The object appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a bright white light. It was hovering in one spot in the sky and appeared to be very high in altitude. I continued to observe the object for approximately 5 minutes as I drove along the highway. The object then suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view.

I am a 42 year old male and I have never before seen anything like this in the sky. I am a rational and level-headed person and I am quite certain of what I saw. I request that this incident be thoroughly investigated. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,
