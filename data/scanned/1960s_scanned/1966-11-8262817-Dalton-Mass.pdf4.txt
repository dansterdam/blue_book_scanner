1. a light beam
2. a gypsum
3. swamp gas
4. birds (a little slow when do they light up)
5. clouds (some reason)
6. fireflies
7. Trick to
8. muscles - in the background seen
9. hallus - with the normal type flame
10. satellites - had all night light ?
11. aircraft - may be an unusual occurrence
12. some made the that down to 500ft we might look at
