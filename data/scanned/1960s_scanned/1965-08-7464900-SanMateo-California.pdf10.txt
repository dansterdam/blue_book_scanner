RE-EXAMINATION AND ANALYSES

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTINGS, AUGUST 22, 1965, TINELLIA, CALIFORNIA. TWO REPORTS OF OBSERVATIONS RECEIVED.

OBJECTIVE: To check all possible data on the scene and to find any additional data in the original report. 
NOTE: Original report was written in California and was determined by this office to have originating data.

GENERAL RE-EXAMINATION: Object positions were measured at the scene. Sightings were plotted on the panorama. This was done to determine the elevation angles, azimiths, and relative positions of the objects observed. The objects therefore are those dealt with in the original report. Descriptions have been made from the data in the report, with some additional information obtained. Further clarification on the point from which the drawing was made, exact time of observations, color, size, and distances, is necessary.

CONCLUSIONS: (As shown in diagram) "A" maximum elevation, 73.4° "B" maximum elevation, 60.5° while rising over nearby hills. 
Objects B: Minimum elevation, 16.6° while rising over hills, as described in the original report.
Objects C: Minimum elevation, 13.6° while rising. Also recorded in elevation over buildings, 14.1° and 14.3° respectively, in two additional observations.

Object D: Minimum elevation, approximately 5.9° maximum elevation.

The apparent elevation or several landmarks was measured from the point of observation to determine orientation. Some conclusions of the original data are confirmed in these measurements.
