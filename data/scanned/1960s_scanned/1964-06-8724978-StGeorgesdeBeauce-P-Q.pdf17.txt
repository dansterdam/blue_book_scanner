The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document with text describing an incident related to a UFO sighting.

When Friday was published a large number of red particles appeared in the sky over St. Georges de Beauce, Province of Quebec, Canada. One of the passengers at a window seat of a bus from Quebec to Victoriaville, Australia at 9:14 a.m. on June 5 took this photograph of the phenomenon. The particles appeared to be in colour and at a private showing the picture was described as resembling fireflies. After the picture was taken the particles disappeared from view. However, underneath the print it is stated that there appeared to be a small round object in the sky, but the camera "was 'hooded' to prevent such accidents."
