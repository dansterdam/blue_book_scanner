TYPED COMMENTS MADE BY DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK ON JUNE 1968

GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN                                  12 FEBRUARY 1967
Unidentified: Information given insufficient to establish
whether it was more likely that birds (possibly nocturnal white owls?)
or reflection on water, or aircraft, might have provided the original
stimulus. A one-witness case, and hardly worth further investigation.
