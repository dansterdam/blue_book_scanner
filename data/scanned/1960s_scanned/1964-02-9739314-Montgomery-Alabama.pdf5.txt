COMMENTS: DURING THE PERIOD OF OBSERVATION, THE SIGHTING WAS RE-
PORTED BY THE OBSERVER TO A LT COL ███████ (USAF RET) WHO IM-
MEDIATELY (1842 HRS) STEPPED OUTSIDE FOR OBSERVATION AND MADE THREE
OBSERVATIONS DURING THE PERIOD OF 1842 TO 1935 HOURS WITH NO NOTICE-
ABLE CHANGE IN OBJECT POSITION. COL ███████, WHO WAS A COMMAND
PILOT WITH OVER 7,000 FLYING HOURS, STATED TO THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER
THAT HE IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED THE OBJECTS AS CELESTIAL BODIES. HE
STATED FURTHER THAT THEY WERE UNUSUALLY BRIGHT, BUT THAT HE AT-
TRIBUTES THIS TO THE CLEAR ATMOSPHERE WHICH FOLLOWED THE PASSING OF
A COLD FRONT. COL ███████ IS PERSONALLY KNOWN TO THE INVESTIGATING
OFFICER AND IS CONSIDERED VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND COMPLETELY RELIA-
BLE. THIS INFORMATION AND THE OPINION OF THE BASE METEOROLOGICAL
OFFICER INDICATES THAT THE OBJECTS WERE DEFINITELY PLANETS.
