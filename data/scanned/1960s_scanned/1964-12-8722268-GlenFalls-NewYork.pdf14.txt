My attention was directed to an object in the sky, it was of a deep red color, and appeared to be a light, of some sort. The object was an irregular oval shape and seemed to be quite large, at least the size of a jet aircraft, and quite close, not more than a few hundred yards distant and at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet above the ground.
The object seemed to be slowly hovering, without any apparent means of support or propulsion. The object was close enough for me to see that it had no wings, tail or any other appendages such as is found on an aircraft.
The object was observed for approximately 5-10 minutes, the it began to move slowly toward the east. As it moved, the color faded to a pale orange and then disappeared from sight. This object was observed by several people who were standing with me at the time.
I am able to follow it by eye until it was out of sight. The weather was clear and the visibility was excellent. The object did not make any sound that I could detect. I have no theory as to what the object might have been, but I am quite certain that it was not any kind of conventional aircraft that I am familiar with.
Every detail of this sighting is fresh in my memory, and I could give a detailed description of the object if needed. I hope that this report will be of some value in your investigations of unidentified flying objects.
