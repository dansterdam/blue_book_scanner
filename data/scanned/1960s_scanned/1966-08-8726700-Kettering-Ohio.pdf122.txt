MAY 8 1967

Dear Mr.

Reference your recent letter reporting your August 22, 1966 observation of an unidentified flying object. The data of the report indicates a detailed scientific investigation.

We have enclosed Project Blue Book's analysis of the case. The late date of the report, coupled with your sighting, a meaningful scientific investigation would have been possible. Your report will be filed for information purposes.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. I have declassified the 1967 report on our project which I think you will find interesting.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
