Dear Major Quintanilla,

I am writing to you about an old sighting I had many years ago. One of my contacts, a photographer, photographed it at the time. (I do not have all the pictures sent) I do believe in flying saucers but have never really seen any until this event, which I would describe as being a few of my wares. Of course, I told my friends that they are really among us and no one will believe it. They actually saw a lot of them with many some and really believe it. As for starting to get out of hand, I would like to say that they are on the best terms without us or my friends that they could make real use of.

Here are the pictures and how I have them: Pictures #1, #2, and #4 are all done by flashlight exposure. First, I cut out different sizes and shapes of things and attach them on a black cloth. Then I would take the first exposure. The second exposure is there over a few minutes, and then the last one. There are several small spots or reflections in the glass resulting from this trick.
