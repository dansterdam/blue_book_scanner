Gentlemen:

What I am about to relate to you may to some people sound like an attempt for attention.  However, may to me it was so real, as the paper this letter is typed on. Please refer to the map I have attached. 

It was on a night, not too late, in either late July or early August when I made a sighting.It wasn't too dark where shapes couldn't be seen against the sky. I was standing at one of the highest points in Camp Kinder - Ring, in Hopewell June., Poughkeepsie, when while I was looking through a group of trees that formed a "V", I got looking to the like a "teaspoon". It seemed to me to be about the size of a "nickle" or dime in the sky. Over the three lights on the area above the bottom ridge.The color I felt was unimportant to the situation. After about one hour or less of hovering in one position it just seemed to vanish from sight.It didn't really zoom off into the horizon, it just seemed to melt into the sky. Everyone I told scoffed at me so I kept silent, until now when I decided to structure my high school class on the subject,as I have been following it for a number of years. I have no photographs or evidence,except my word,to prove what I saw.In fact even over the facts to myself,I filled out a report as best I could, as isn't a very area.

Please examine what I have told you, and do whatever you feel necessary.

Please get in touch with me soon.

Thank you very much.
