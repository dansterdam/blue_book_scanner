There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows handwritten text that appears to be a letter describing an observation of an unidentified aerial object or craft.

Dear major - 
I can't stop thinking of the U.F.O. I observed last month and its implications and potential. The craft appeared to be of definite shape, and the white exhaust or flame from the craft was not clearly visible to me. There was a definite shape, and the craft was not clearly visible. I was in the backyard of my home on the outskirts of the city. I just wanted to mention that the body of the craft appeared in definite shape. This craft appears to be real rather than imaginary.

Sincerely after sighting the craft image was still clear in my mind compare what I would call a normal aircraft to the exhaust light appeared larger reddish purple in color and brighter than the typical pulsating stroke of the exhaust lights from conventional aircraft.
