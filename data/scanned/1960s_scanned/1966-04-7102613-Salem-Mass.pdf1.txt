10. CONCLUSION 
AIRCRAFT - The witness given account exactly describes the sighting and lights of an aircraft. Although all the moving lights were first thought to be an aircraft, the witness then confirmed that the object that he saw had a landing light and, therefore, was definitely an aircraft. 

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
When first sighted it had a red light on the left or starboard side. This was flashing on and off. The object then seemed to be turning and the red light was no longer visible but the witness then saw a flashing green light. As the object continued to move away the witness observed that it had two steady white lights. The object appeared stationary. Then the two white lights disappeared and the object began to move away rapidly. The following day when the witness was driving over a steel beamed bridge his car radio went dead, Witness thought that the object that he had seen had passed over about 30 feet the bridge.
