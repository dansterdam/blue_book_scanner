The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record, which is a project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the United States. The image shows a standard form used to document a UFO sighting, including details such as the date, location, source, number of objects, length of observation, type of observation (ground-visual), and physical evidence. However, there are no photographs included in this particular document.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

10. CONCLUSION 
Possible AIRCRAFT
The observer did not give his complete address. No other reports were received regarding this Columbus aircraft. It is possible that the observer saw an airplane disappear over the horizon, giving the appearance of a sighting. The observer sighted a white, blue, and red object (9) about 2 degrees in size. The object or lights were observed for 5-6 minutes and at the end of the sighting appeared to crash.
