34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 12 October 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific point questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
The object made 2-1 minute flights over the city, completing the first flight it vanished momentarily, then returned. The object made 3 flights within a 3 minute period both flights and return. 
Ques. 10 & 11. In answer to #10 I stated that the object did not appear as a solid. In answer to #11, the object did not appear as a star.
Ques. 13. The object did not change brightness at any time. However, when I observed it through the distance the object would naturally appear smaller and less outstanding. 
Since I took the photograph of this object, I have observed no further flights. As of the above date I have not seen anything that resembles the object and all of the negatives were returned complete. My eyesight and hearing are excellent and I can hear the object making no sound. If there was any type of known propulsion involved, I would have been able to hear it.
