There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a typed document, likely an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Dear Sir:

You can readily see by the addressee of this letter that I do not know to whom to write. And I have been floundering: these are unidentified objects and what-not looking at me, so it would be futile to write because this situation was threatened to the Assistant Director to write because this situation has gone several.

I'm a habitual star-gazer. I have over walked the field of a few acres looking for stars, but always away from the heavens with a dull routine and the like. But on the evening of February 12 at about 6:25 I saw - out of the corner of an eye - a brilliant warm orange-red star! I rubbed my eyes and observed it again. It was Venus, and much larger than I had ever seen it before. It was not twinkling at all, just a brilliant steady glow. It held its position until about 7:15 when it began to diminish in magnitude and color. By 7:30 it was darker than the incandescents, and col-lapsed to the horizon. The whole performance lasted about an hour.

But here is what astounds me. Shortly after this celestial display had ended a round, glowing object appeared in the southwest, first a dim light and then building up to a brilliant white light, and then diminishing again, all in a matter of five to ten minutes. It moved from one point to another, not in a straight line, but as if guided or controlled.

I do not know what this was, but I am certain that it was no normal celestial body or aircraft. I am a student of astronomy, and I have never seen anything like this before. I am hoping that you, or others associated with the space program, can throw some light on this phenomenon. I would appreciate any information or suggestions you might be able to offer.

Sincerely,
