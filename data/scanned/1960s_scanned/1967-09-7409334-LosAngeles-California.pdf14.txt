ATTN OF: MAYA/C. D. HOUSTON/59036/132

SUBJECT: Analysis of Material from Los Angeles, California

TO: TDET/UFO (Lt. Marano)

1. The sample submitted by Mrs. Los Angeles, California was analyzed and the data obtained was included in report dated 12 October 1967.

2. The 3/8" disc of metal, which appeared to have been punched from a 1/4" sheet, was analyzed spectrographically and found to be unalloyed iron. The carbon content was found to be 0.21%, thereby classifying the material as a type 1020 steel, which is quite common.

3. Material corresponding to both samples can be found in the scrap pile of any steel mill.
