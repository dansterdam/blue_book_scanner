6. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The observer reported seeing a pale yellow light in the sky which drifted slowly overhead. Children said it looked like a shooting star that did not go out. Sighting is very confusing with that of a flare. Official explanation is possible parachu flares as a probable explanation. The winds were to the SW and would have accounted for the slow SW drift.
