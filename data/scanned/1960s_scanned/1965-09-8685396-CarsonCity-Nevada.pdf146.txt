34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  20 January 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Pertaining to sighting 33 - 
I feel that the details of follow up is not adequate and lack of continued recording of information when a point of additional investigation is detected. 
As I noted there were 6 persons (before a witness) who said they saw this - the said that no two descriptions were alike, when a point of discrepancy arrives it was not followed up where additional information might be secured.
Curiosity does - after the fact investigation by said interviewing investigator for need not to discard anomaly simply because 'it does not fit into a pre-established pattern'
My said view I shared approx on 8/31/1965.
Also, 8 month delay in your contact with me I take it is your normal procedure.
