My friend and I were sitting in a car on the highway a little over 10 miles north of Omaha, Nebraska, around midnight when we noticed a light in the sky. At first it appeared to be a star, but it soon became obvious that it was much closer and moving quite rapidly from west to east. It appeared oblong in shape, not round, and had a glowing halo or ring around it. After watching it for a few minutes, it suddenly disappeared. This is only one handwritten piece on the card.
