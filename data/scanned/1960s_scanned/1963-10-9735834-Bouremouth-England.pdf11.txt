December 4, 1963

Dear Mrs L.J.G.

I thank you for your letter of November 7, 1963 in which you appear to state an "unidentified aerial phenomena" which you observed on September 21, 1963.

I regret that your letter intended in making an official report on this sighting, which was unidentified, to the Project Blue Book office has not been answered. I was unaware of the report and would have been glad to reply to your many questions. 

The information would have been greatly appreciated and would have provided details which could have been integrated into the analysis of this case. I am sure that you would kindly answer any additional questions I might ask, and provide you with the results of our evaluation.

This report appears to be similar to many others we have collected, which relate to aspects of sightings of unusual objects in the sky. As you know, we endeavor to investigate and analyze such reports scientifically in order to determine, if possible, the nature and causes of the phenomena. Your further cooperation in providing details of your observation would be most helpful.

Dr. Allen, who heads the Project Blue Book office, would be pleased to furnish you with copies of available technical reports if you are interested. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Sincerely,

Major Hector Quintanilla
Assistant Chief, USAF
