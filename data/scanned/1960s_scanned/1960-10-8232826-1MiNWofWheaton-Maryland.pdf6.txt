SUBJECT: BASIC OPERATIONS OFFICER, INVESTIGATOR QUERIED
USAF, AWS AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AGENCIES IN THE
WASHINGTON, D.C. METROPOLITAN AREA FOR ADDITIONAL
POSSIBLE SIGHTINGS, HOWEVER, NONE WAS REPORTED.
NAVAL OBSERVATORY REPORTED NO SIGHTINGS, BUT INDICATED
THE OBJECT MAY HAVE BEEN A METEOR. HOWEVER, NAVAL
OBSERVATORY OBSERVED A METEOR WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE FOR
THREE (3) MINUTES. ONLY REASONABLE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE
OBJECT OBSERVED WAS THE LANDING LIGHT OF AN ONCOMING AIRCRAFT.
WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT, BOLLING AFB AND ANACOSTIA NAS
ARE LOCATED DUE SOUTH OF WHEATON, MARYLAND. LANDING PATTERNS
AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING WERE TO THE NORTH AT ALL THREE
AIRPORTS, AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE OBSERVER SAW THE
LANDING LIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT ON A STRAIGHT-IN APPROACH,
THUS GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF A STATIONARY OBJECT.
