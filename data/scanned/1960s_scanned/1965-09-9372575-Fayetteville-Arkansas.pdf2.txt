Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

Please excuse the delay in replying to your letter regarding photographs taken by your friend.

Should your friend desire to have the films analyzed by the Air Force, the original negative will be returned to this office and your friend will be informed of the results.

I am enclosing a report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force UFO project. I hope this information will be of interest to you.

Your interest in Air Force matters is appreciated.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
