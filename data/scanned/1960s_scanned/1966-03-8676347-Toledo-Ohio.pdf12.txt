There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten report or document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. government program that investigated UFO sightings.

The text in the document reads:

"34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7 April 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I was walking to the stone store when I looked up and saw a bright light go overhead in the sky. As it passed over it appeared to shine on the ground below and then it went straight from north to south very rapidly. It was observed about 10:45. I seemed to shine like a window in the sky and it went right straight down the street.

The postal address became a close building on Summit street, because I was on the corner of 106th and Summit street. The one about the size of a car was a higher brightness than a star and dimmer than the full moon and moved in a straight line on a clear night, because if a meteor or aircraft had been the case, the close observer would have been more because the cloudy caused it to stand out.

Sincerely yours

P.S. I would be delighted to have a talk with the U.F.O's and to give other some of the possible."
