There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

At first it was one object which appeared to be a Lighted blob (no defined shape). It moved behind trees and appeared to go out and on again. Then there were 2 similar objects that appeared to the right of the first one. They seemed to move from right to left and appeared to go out and on again. They did not seem to be connected or related other than apparently being lighted objects of some sort. After a short time they all seemed to disappear.
