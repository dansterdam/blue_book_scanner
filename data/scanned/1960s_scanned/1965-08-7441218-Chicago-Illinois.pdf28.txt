INITIALS _3.9_

UNUSUAL REMARKS AT UR ADDITION OF THE INITIAL UFO REPORT ON CASE NO. 38-M, DATED 22 JULY 1965. WEATHER CIRCULATIO N OVER CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, COOLING AT 2000 OVER CHICAGO INTO A COLD FRONT. AT 2230 CENTRAL STANDARD TIME, UNUSUAL SIGHTING OF BRIGHT LIGHT MOVING NORTHWARD SOUTH OF CHICAGO AT HIGH VELOCITY.
LOCATION: While interviewing [REDACTED] my impression was that he wasn't giving me the whole story. He seemed to be holding back information. At first he stated he noticed a bright light in the sky and didn't know what it was. After further questioning, he admitted he had watched the light for some time and it appeared to maneuver or change direction rapidly at high speed, something that was not characteristic of any conventional aircraft. He stated it made a sharp turn at one point, impossible for any known aircraft. In my opinion the coloration of the reported object would discount an identification as the reported object would discount an identification as the planet Venus which was visible in the sky at that time. I cannot discount an intelligent control of the observation.
