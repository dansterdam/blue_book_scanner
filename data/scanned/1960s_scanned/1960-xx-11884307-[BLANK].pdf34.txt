Flying Saucer Problem 
Reviewed In New Film
The subject of flying saucers is reviewed in 
a new film allegedly dealing with an alleged documented case of a saucer sighting, particularly interesting because a former U.S. Air Force officer, Capt. Edward Ruppelt, is involved.

Capt. Ruppelt, who worked there is a writer and later in the Pentagon at Washington, is said to be one of the technical advisers on the film.

The film, made under the sponsorship of the American Rocket Society, is said to be based on the sighting of an unidentified flying object over the Pacific during 1950.

The subject of flying saucers has attracted so much attention recently that this new film is expected to add a fresh approach to the problem. Inasmuch as Capt. Ruppelt is involved, it is hoped that the film will provide some definitive information on the baffling question.
