2. The following information is provided to assist in answering the attached letter:

a. Since there are over 8,000 UFO cases in the Air Force files, it would be possible to send a brief report of almost 6 of our 35 reports, hoaxes, balloons, etc. The Fact Sheet provides information on analyzing procedures and how reports are handled.

b. Due to the large expense involved in duplicating photos, they are available only to the general public for a charge.
