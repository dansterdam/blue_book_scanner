The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a text description of a reported UFO sighting in Linden, New Jersey on April 13. The text describes the sighting of a "grey object" that was seen moving at an enormous speed and closely resembled a "large automobile and made no sound". The report is attributed to Mr. D. Tomion and Mr. L. Lampeck, who witnessed the object from 30 Eighth Street in Linden.

Linden UFO

The Du Transolor on April 13
carried the following report: "A GREY
object was seen last night over
Linden, (Rahwayfburg) at about
7:30 P.M. At least three people saw
it. It was moving at an
enormous speed. It closely resembled 
a large automobile and made no 
sound. Mr. D Tomion and I saw the
object quite clearly for about 10
seconds until it disappeared behind
some trees," said Mr. L. Lampeck,
of 30 Eighth Street, Linden. Late
last night no one could explain what
it really was.
