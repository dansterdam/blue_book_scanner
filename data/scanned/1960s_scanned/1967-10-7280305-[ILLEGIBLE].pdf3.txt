The sighting was very close, during which time an object was observed that was in the air, some 30-40 feet above ground and about 100-150 feet away, illuminated in a colorful manner with flashing lights that seemed to change color. The object appeared to be some 40-50 feet in diameter and was a sort of circular shape. The object made no sound whatsoever. The night was clear and there was nothing in the sky except this object. The size and appearance of the object as well as the closeness of the sighting made a very definite impression on the observers. The experience lasted about 2 to 3 minutes, during which time several people were able to observe the object clearly.
