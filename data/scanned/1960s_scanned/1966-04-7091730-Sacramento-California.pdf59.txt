The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, showing handwritten text.

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

"I believe it was 19 Jan. for 9
that the witness claimed this sighting occurred.
The witness was on active duty in the military and
his occupation was electronics. He stated he could
not identify the object at the time, but that he felt it
was some type of aircraft or vehicle. He stated
the object was a reddish light in color, round in shape,
and moved very slowly across the sky. He said it
was visible for about 1 to 2 minutes."
