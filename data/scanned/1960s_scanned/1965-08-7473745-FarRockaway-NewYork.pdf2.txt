There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, containing a letter describing an unidentified aerial object observed by the recipient.

Mrs Hunt/man/SAPFRRZ72383/
Dear Mr:
I am enclosing a description of the object which you observed from the Brooklyn area on 17 July 1965.
The object appears to be elliptical in shape, extremely bright, having a white-blue light, and according to your information was visible for quite a while.
William Van Embden, who is associated with the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, has reviewed your letter and based on his analysis would like to contact you for additional information. He is not a meteor, so we will no doubt contact you for addition information.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. SPAULDING
