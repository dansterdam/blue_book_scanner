There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text.

The text output is as follows:

as it swept around in circles over trees (and possibly played on a large layer, as the temperature was in the low thirties following a hot day, a condition conductive to an inversion layer. A UPI reporter advised that he received 14 television channels that night).

The locations from which the calls came were all close to the route of the police car. In this investigator's opinion, all the calls at or around 0:30 on 21 May may be attributed to the police-run.

1. The siren. Reports of strange noises, looping blue lights. Almost certainly results of emergency police car run at same time, 0:30, 21 May 1964, Lansing.
