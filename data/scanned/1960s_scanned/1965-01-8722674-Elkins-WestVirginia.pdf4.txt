There is no photograph or image present in this document. This appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

the saucer about the size of the quarter of moon and appeared to be suspended over the trees. I yelled and came out on the porch and the saucer moved very rapidly northward at an altitude of about 500 feet. It was hovering over the trees when I first saw it and when it moved away it picked up speed very rapidly. The saucer was a silvery color and metallic in appearance. I am a housewife in my thirties and live in a rural area of West Virginia. I have never seen anything like this before. I was quite excited at the time but have thought a lot about it since and I am still at a loss to explain what I saw. I hope this report will be of some help to your project.
