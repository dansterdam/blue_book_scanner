FT. Washakie, Wyoming.
Feb, 8, 1961

Dear Sir:
I am enclosing a drawing of a circular object that I saw on the evening of Feb. 6, 1961 over Fort Washakie, Wyoming. This object was hovering at an altitude of about 300 feet and was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. The object was a dull silver color and seemed to be made of metal. It had a dome on top and there were no visible signs of any protrusions, ports, windows or other appendages. The object was motionless for about 10 to 15 minutes, then it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds.
I was with two other people when I saw this and they can verify what I have reported. I am 24 years old and have never seen anything like this before. I would appreciate it if you could let me know if you have had any other similar reports from this area.
Sincerely,
[Signature]
