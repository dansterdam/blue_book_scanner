The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, which contains written text describing several UFO sighting incidents.

TEXT OUTPUT:

In our own case, and in the cases shortly to be before 
us, we can vouch only for the fact that the reports do exist, 
and that whatever stimulus generated them, it generated them 
for a number of observers rather than a single individual.
Let us go on with a few more French saucers and then
sample a few from this country and elsewhere. Let me 
capsulate a few:

September 7 at Amiens, 7:15 a.m.: "...my eyes were caught
by a sort of mound, two hundred yards away in a field. It
looked something like an unfinished haystack, with an upside
down plinth on top.
"That's a queer color for a haystack," I said to Yves,"look
at it." All of a sudden I noticed that the haystack was
moving a little, with a slight swing back and forth, like an
oscillation. We both rushed toward the mysterious object.
When we got close the object took off on a slant, traveled
diagonally upward for about fifty feet, and then began to
go straight up. We watched it for three minutes. The object
was about 30 feet in diameter."

September 18: "...an object arrived at high speed over
the horizon, stood still several minutes over the town, and
then disappeared into the zenith."

September 19: "A circular object appeared suddenly in
the north. It was flat gray and appeared to be metallic; 
it slowed, stopped, and remained motionless for about 30
seconds, during which time it swayed back and forth slightly.
After a half minute it went off again in a northwest direction."
