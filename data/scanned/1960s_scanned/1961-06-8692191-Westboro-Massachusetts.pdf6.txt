"it was definitely not a aircraft of any kind. The shape was like of a disk or saucer as described from many reports of what is called flying saucers. the object was hovering above the ground as to my best estimate 50 to 75 feet up. It was moving at a very slow rate of speed, probably 10 to 15 miles per hour. At no time did it make any noise such as a jet engine or propeller aircraft. The estimated diameter of the object was approximately 35 to 40 feet. The color appeared to be a dull gray or metallic in nature. It was a clear night and there were no clouds in the sky. I observed this object for a period of approximately 2 to 3 minutes before it accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight going in a northerly direction."
