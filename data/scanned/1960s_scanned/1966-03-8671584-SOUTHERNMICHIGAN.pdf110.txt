J. Allen Hynek sits at control board of his electronic astronomical equipment at Dearborn Observatory, but reports of "Unidentified Flying Objects" sent to him to investigate trouble area. The major sighting events of the week which Hynek had to face included: Eight Hillsdale (Mich.) College coeds reporting they saw a hovering "flying object" settle in a swampy hollow near their dormitory; the Hillsdale County civil defense director, Van Horn, and his 16-year-old son in Dexter, Mich. said they saw an object that glowed like a cigarette with a greenish-blue light on one end and a white light on the other side of the object behind the man's farmhouse; and photographs of "unidentified flying objects" taken by a Michigan Sheriff's deputy were released by the sheriff to a nation-wide news program on CBS television. The report states that Hynek concluded the "UFO photos" were nothing but rotating vegetation patterns and water conditions.
