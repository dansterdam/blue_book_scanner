Text extracted from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: August 26 1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

This object was the largest and most vivid of my sightings. It was completely silent and showed no exhaust or flame. The object remained stationary over 10 to 15 minutes.
The object disappeared gradually by going out of sight rather than disappearing abruptly. It did not suddenly go out of sight.
It made no sound whatsoever.

It was like a brilliant (multicolored) source
or not like a normal aircraft type. I did not hear any news reports on this sighting.

It 4:45 AM on August 2, 1965.

Sincerely yours,
