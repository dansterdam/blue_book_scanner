The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image contains a single photograph of some unidentified flying object or phenomenon. The text on the document discusses various details and observations related to the image, including descriptions of the object, potential explanations, and the conclusions drawn from the incident.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

1. Clouds - Apparently can be ruled out, because the report says visual sightings and district shape, and visual do not agree.

2. Operator error - No evidence or indication of this. Photos look the same as the visual sightings.

3. Jamming - Normal jamming doesn't look like this. Visual sightings don't correspond.

4. Interference (man-made, or other radar) - Doesn't normally look like this on the scope. Visual sightings could seem to validate.

5. Equipment malfunction - Highly unlikely, primarily because of visual sightings, and also due to randomness of the returns.

6. Anomalous propagation - Although there evidently was no temperature inversion during the period, anomalous propagation is the most likely cause considered. (Radar returns could be distorted but visual sightings are both electromagnetic in nature, variations in the density of the atmosphere could affect both.)

3. Conclusion - It is concluded that the only logical explanation that fits all the data is anomalous propagation. The appearance (size, shape, movement) and randomness of the radar returns are characteristic of that.

1. Attached photo prints illustrate graphically the radical changes that occurred in the shape (reflected) and intensity of the return (brightness) which is an indication of the time involved.
