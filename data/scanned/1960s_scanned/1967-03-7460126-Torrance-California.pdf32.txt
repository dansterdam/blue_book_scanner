There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report on an unidentified object sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

REPORTING DATA
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT
LOCATION: TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA
DATE: 13 March

AP: - IR: - QUALITY: Two transparencies

1. PURPOSE: This report answers a request (Work Order Number 67-109) by NPIC/PSD/PIC for an analysis of an unidentified object as shown in two photo transparencies. The transparencies were sent in by Robert Scholes.

2. ANALYSIS: The two transparencies examined by NPIC/PSD/PIS were of poor quality and there was not enough detail in the images to permit any analysis. Earlier correspondence with Robert Scholes, which contained the information he wished the National Photographic Interpretation Center to analyze, indicated the camera used was a 127 film camera. The quality of the transparencies received was not sufficient to allow any meaningful interpretation.

3. PHOTO PROCEEDING:
a. The photo proceeding appears to be an examination of the two transparencies. There are no discernible objects in the transparencies.
b. The format, size of the two transparencies, and a technical description of the transparencies are included in this report. The transparencies have apparently been cut from a 127 film roll.

c. The format, size of the transparencies, etc. are given.
d. The black and white transparency received is probably an example of the quality of the original photographs.
