The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO) or aerial phenomenon. The sketch shows a side view of an object with a cylindrical shape and what appears to be some protrusions or other details. The sketch is accompanied by a series of questions and answers related to the observation of the object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
NO

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No)   Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of or anything at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes (No)   Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: BUZZING
b. Color: METAL - STAINLESS STEEL TYPE - GRAYISH

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had trouble with this experiment or the object was otherwise too distant, estimate the apparent size.
Appears to be about 10 feet in diameter and about 25 feet long. The light was very bright and seemed to pulsate and swish downward about 10 feet and then back up about 10 feet, in a rhythmic motion, like a heart beat. The object seemed to be slightly tilted with the bottom end farther away from the observer.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, proturberances, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please aim your drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
