I had been unable to go back to sleep and just a little before 6:00AM the clock went off and I got out of bed and made preparations for going to work. I related my experience of the night to the two members of my driving combinations - one from Portsmouth and one from Churchland - as we were driving to NASA on the morning of January 17, 1969 and they gave no reply. After I arrived at work I related it to a good deal of discussion followed. I related my experience to ______ and he in turn contacted the local newspaper. A reporter from the newspaper called me and I told him what I had seen and heard during the night. I also told him about my discussion with the telephone operator and what she had said to me during our telephone conversation. I was unable to get the name of the telephone operator I had talked to on January 17, 1969 however, after trying every day since January 19, 1969 I finally got an answer from the Chief operator on Wednesday evening January 22, 1969 - she said "I have had a talk at length with her and the only thing she could have possibly heard during the course of the night was the normal sound of an aircraft going over". I tried to tell her that the girl had stated different to me and that I would like to talk to her under any circumstances with any one present and get her name but she said "it would do no good" because she repeated the same thing over again just as if a briefing had gone on and that she had rehearsed her statement over and over.
