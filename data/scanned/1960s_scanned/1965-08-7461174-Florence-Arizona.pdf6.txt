The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document that is describing an incident where an unidentified object was observed. The text states that the object would be difficult to judge properly for that time of night, and that the reappearance of the object with a different color and trails could be accounted for by the changing aspects of the object. The officer has no further comment on the incident.

BECAUSE BELIEVES WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO JUDGE PROPERLY FOR THAT TIME OF NIGHT. THE REAPPEARANCE WITH A DIFFERENT COLOR AND TRAILS COULD BE ACCOUNTED BY THE CHANGING ASPECTS OF THE OBJECT. THIS OFFICER HAS NO FURTHER COMMENT.
