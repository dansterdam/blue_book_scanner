The object sighted at 10:30 PM was a self-luminous light source comparable in size to a bright star. It was observed travelling in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. The unusual features about the object wore its rapid acceleration and deceleration, the manner of its flight, and the absence of any blinking lights which are characteristic of aircraft. The object was not resolvable through binoculars.

The object was sighted at 2:00 AM EDT. 15 - 20Â° above the western horizon. The witness, a woman, was awakened observing the object. The object made a sudden stop and hovered momentarily directly overhead. As the woman watched, the object shot straight up at a phenomenal speed. There were no sounds associated with the object. The woman stated she had not been earlier the same evening the woman saw the object ascend to a stationary center of yellow-white light, then descend rapidly in a straight line behind distant trees.

EVALUATION:
During both sightings the sky was clear and many stars were visible. No flights or aircraft were detected. The witnesses' reaction and excitement indicates they observed an unusual phenomenon. Their descriptions of the objects' motions and characteristics cannot be explained by known devices. Other UFO sightings in this general area in July warranted a report to NICAP.
