There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

On the evening of June 17, 1960 at approximately 8 : 52 PM what is described in the report as a luminous object which I could reckon, it was about 50-60 degrees above the horizon & a distance of 250-260 degrees southwest.

It appeared only for about 2 to 3 seconds and it was rapidly descending and to the NNE the brightness decreasing very rapidly.

I realize that this information may be of very little value, I am not an astronomer but an one of my Astronomy acquaintances, is one who studies the subject of UFO's. It was in my opinion, not a falling star, because our friend Chester H. is also to be very watchful about the time of "hush-hops" etc. as common way on marked phenomena, I cannot on this bit of information is of very importance.

IF I CAN BE OF ANY FURTHER SERVICE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME.
