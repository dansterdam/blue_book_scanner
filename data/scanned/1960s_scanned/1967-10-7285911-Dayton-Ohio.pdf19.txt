There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document with a sketch and some text.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the so show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the so where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture to illustrate what they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.

The text consists of instructions and questions that appear to be part of a UFO sighting report form or questionnaire from Project Blue Book.
