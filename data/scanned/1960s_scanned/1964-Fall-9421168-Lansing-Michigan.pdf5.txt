OCR output:

This document appears to be a handwritten page from a UFO report. The text discusses an unidentified flying object observation, though many details have been redacted or obscured. I will transcribe the visible text as accurately as possible:

"This is an account of what I observed on the night of August 26, 1964 near Lansing, Michigan. At approximately 8:45 p.m. I was outside checking the property when I observed a bright light in the sky. The object seemed to be moving erratically and emitting a faint humming sound. It appeared to be disc-shaped and was approximately 100 feet in diameter. The object hovered for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view. I immediately reported the sighting to the authorities."
