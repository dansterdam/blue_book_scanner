Sirs,

I would like to report the sighting of a UFO on the evening of March 31, 1967. It was a Friday night and every Friday/Saturday night I go outside with my telescope and binoculars to watch planes, etc. This particular night I was with my brother and sister who are both 12 yrs old. We were sitting down when my brother spotted a red light coming in very low (at tree top level). It must have been about one mile away. We just took it as another plane coming over, because about every 5 minutes a plane passes overhead. Then all of a sudden we noticed some strange movement. It was from the craft itself. It made a 90 degree turn (like the first of many). It came almost directly over our house. I looked at it with my binoculars and I saw that it was a cigar-shaped thing with a red light in the back, and the back it had a green light. It didn't make any sound whatsoever. Then we saw a jet come over and the thing started to follow the jet. The jet seemed to put on a burst of speed and the thing followed the jet.
