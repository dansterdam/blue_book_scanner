direction:

All of this took place within a few seconds, but I have tried to describe it as best I can how it appeared at the time. Through the windshield, which was clear, I could see the object quite clearly as it passed us. Looking back through the rear window, I could see it for some distance after it had passed us. It was flying was somewhat erratic and seemed to be taking evasive action. At one point it seemed to come to a dead stop but then quickly resumed its course. 

I am reporting this to you in case you have had other reports on this incident which may be useful. I want to cooperate in any way I can to be of service. I believe if have told you all I can remember at this time. I can remember if should be additional information I will be glad to forward it to you. Until Friday, July 26.
