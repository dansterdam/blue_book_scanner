The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document describing a UFO sighting.

Downward in a diagonal line towards the south, a bright light came up running from the west. As it came up, it luminous from the outline as it came down gradually and then came to a complete stop. It remained motionless for about twenty seconds. Then it began to travel again, making a turn towards the east, then disappeared over the eastern horizon.

Throughout this event, the object was bluish green except for a few seconds when it appeared to get brighter. They called the Office of the U.F.O. ("unidentified flying objects") and asked if there was an earth-made satellite visible at 9:30 on that evening. They said that only Venus was visible at that time, and at 10:30 this object could not be an airplane or satellite as it did not move like any known aircraft.
