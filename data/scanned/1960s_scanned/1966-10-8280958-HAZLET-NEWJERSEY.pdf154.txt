by a light point about a boys the cloud.  all five traveled but a ves diappered in the haze. The wiznessed dog to order up and many dis to appear. the police arrived. The 5 witness now began to move about spothe 3 spot where the glow first appeared. At this point large object rose from small object and hoverd at a 45 degree angle then it went out of sight. No other witnesses have been contacted as yet to this event.
Note: What I want to do is this, a witness told me about this sighting, I had told her who asked her about it but she declined to say the rest. This also seemed to indicate her that it did understande going toin the interview because of the way she felt about the incident. was the 5 objects launching or that looked like to her. The said it was much that she need her family at amds against the inc except for the awe as to what she had to previous say "the she cane seen with people and wore a paper and we caine and everyone was with her at the time ." I would doubt it would boe understandable that she could. I would almost doubt it.
