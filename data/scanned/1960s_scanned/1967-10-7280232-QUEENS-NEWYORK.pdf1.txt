PROJECT : 10-78 RECORD
LOCATION : QUEENS, NEW YORK (NEAR LA GUARDIA)
CONCLUSION : Possible (AIRCRAFT/ADVERTISING SIGN)
NATURE OF OBJECTS : -
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION : -
TYPE OF OBSERVATION : VISUAL
PHOTOS : All of the witnesses listed by the observer were from 17's but none returned these forms. The occurance appears to be for a small white light which moved slowly and apparently affected the small neighborhood area. We received no other reports from the civilian population and this description is outlined in Project reports. The description is similar to that of an advertising sign. These signs are attached to aircraft and may also have caused the interference with the observer's television.
