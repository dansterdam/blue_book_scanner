"for the first one started to,you might say,"this" until about 1950 and then it started to blond in with the rest of the sky.I saw something like this about one years ago ,but I didn't know who or where to give my mention to.

Well if you have got this far and you are not yet or have gone cross-eyed with my typing,I would thank you for your time and patience in reading this and trying to cope with my (AHEM! ) jokes.You are piled down with papers ,such as mine,And are filling all in the proper place,the wastepaper basket.If you can give any expleanation what this thing was I would sure know about it. My address is below. Thanks again
yours truly,

P.S. I know these obiects are clouds because most folks this says,so if they don't disappear while staying in one place they're clouds."
