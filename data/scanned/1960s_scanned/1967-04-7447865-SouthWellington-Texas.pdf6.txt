It occurred at a small airport and the duration was one half minute. Following shortly there were three or four sightings made to determine if there were other potential witnesses. Since it occurred at night on December 29, it is possible that there were no other significant witnesses available. Must be carried as unidentified.

15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California.
One witness, duration of sighting only 15 seconds. Had a 67-year old lady still viewing thing in the sky saving time in the middle of August, 1965, and thus the sky still having been reasonably bright. Still have been reasonably bright after 6 p.m. at night. Must be listed as unknown (message cannot be determined).

16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire
I have in my files for 26 February 1966, Manchester, New Hampshire. I do not seem to find a Bartlett, New Hampshire case. See attached supplemental sheet A.

17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.
Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit Dayton.

18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.
Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Air Force has delayed some five months in investigating this case, all I have is the NICAP report. Evaluation pending my visit to copy of the Air Force investigation of same. Based on NICAP report, the sighting is obviously unidentified.

19. 12 February 1967, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
I have only the case send on this case, but judging from it, there seems to be a possibility that this one-witness case was observed by low-flying birds reflecting light. The sighting lasted only 10 seconds, and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.

20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Loco, Texas.
I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it classified.
