Dear Sirs,
I am 13 years old and very much interested in space. Enclosed, please send me some information on the latest project by the U.S.C. world; this is a popular request of mine. Some of these requests are a mere curiosity, and friendly, for a more serious interest in the science? It all must work out in some manner for many American minded men who might do not understand. I know many of the very common named, but I would like more information of a wide view of the subject. There may be a practical and scientific approach to this interest if handled. Yours very truly.
