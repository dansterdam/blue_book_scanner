The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, and an object above the horizon. The instructions indicate that this sketch is meant to demonstrate how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it.

The second sketch shows a person standing on a road, with mountains or hills in the background. This appears to be a scene depicting the location where the observer first saw the object.

The third sketch is a smaller image showing a person silhouetted against a landscape.
