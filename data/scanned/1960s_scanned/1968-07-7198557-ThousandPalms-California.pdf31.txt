Possibly the answer may be here for i the lonely witness or for I feel
that I have been here before for ever and ever many times and i ther
eyes seem to look upon me as though they have known me always and
dear July 31, 1968 I was taken up into this craft and it seemed to 
me that I was not only looking down upon the earth but upon all
creation and somehow i was a part of it all and it was a part of me
and the loneliness and fear that had gripped me before was gone
and I was no longer afraid but rather filled with a great peace and
contentment and I knew that I would return again for this was not the
first time nor would it be the last time I had been here and the the
voices within seemed to be telling me that I had been here many times
before and would return again and again for this was my destiny
and I was not to be afraid for I was an integral part of all creation
and my life and its purpose was known and guarded by those who
had brought me here and would bring me here again.
