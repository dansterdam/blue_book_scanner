29 JULY 1960

Dear Mrs. -----,

Your letter dated 20 July 1960 concerning an unidentified flying object was addressed to President Eisenhower has been referred to this office.

Your letter contains insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore I am enclosing a U.S. Air Force questionnaire which should be filled out and sent to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for their analysis and evaluation.

For your information I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense fact sheet which plainly states the Air Force's position regarding UFOs.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Lt. Col., USAF
