A white cigar-shaped form appeared circular in home at dead of night. Object moved in easterly direction. Very bright light in all directions. Tried to get them to be a trans-bent and not in any way a constellation. Sighted object to be away from S.E. on a long distance, and I could not estimate the size. I could not determine the course of the object, the object disappeared and did not have usual outlines. The object was not identified.
