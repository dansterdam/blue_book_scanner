The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a project record card from Project 10073, which seems to be related to a UFO observation.

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 6 Jul 60
2. DATE-TIME GROUP: 07/09222
3. TYPE OF OBSERVATION:
   G Ground-Radar
   □ Air-Visual
   □ SOURCES: VISUAL-RADAR
4. LOCATION: S of Portland, Oregon
5. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 2
6. COURSE: 'N
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 45 sec
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Two objects the size of a half dollar at arm's length. Round to square, all round botton - dimensions white. Objects appeared to change in elevation, each other and position. Objects first seen at elevation about 30° moving toward zenith in about 4-5 seconds. Objects then began to blink on and off from view. It is difficult to understand how the witness identified the objects were flat on top. No evidence to indicate that this was an a/c fighting.
11. COMMENTS: About 9:30 at night with a bright moon. Time stopped to travel a distance of 20,000 ft. Witness probably observed probably very high altitude balloons or other unusual aerial phenomena. The great distance and bright moon light are not visible from the ground. It is difficult to understand the objects were flat on top. No evidence to indicate that this was an a/c fighting.
