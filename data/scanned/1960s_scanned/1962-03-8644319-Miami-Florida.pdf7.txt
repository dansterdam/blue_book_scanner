The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text describing one. The text states that the photograph shows a 3.0 magnitude object (the reported UFO) which was visible on the image through 7X50 binoculars, but the object was not visually observed because the binoculars were not in use. The observer is sending a report about this observation to Northwestern University.

The text from the document is as follows:

"Sighted in the 7X50 binoculars.
The photograph shows three 3.0 magnitude objects (the objects formed) on the photograph, but the fifth object was visible on the photograph only. The object was not visually observed because the binoculars were not in use. 
I am enclosing the photograph and also sending a report. Yours at Northwestern University.
Respectfully,
Hialeah, Florida"
