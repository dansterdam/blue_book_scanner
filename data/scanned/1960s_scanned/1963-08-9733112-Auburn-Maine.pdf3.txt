This page from the old UFO report document contains two photograph-like images. The first image appears to show some kind of aerial or atmospheric phenomenon, with a trail or streak of some kind. The second image seems to show a ground-based object or feature, but it is difficult to discern any clear details from the low-quality reproduction.
