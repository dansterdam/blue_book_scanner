The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, with a handwritten response to question 35, which asks for "Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting."

The handwritten response states: "Partly officer comment and alleged failure of the moon seen visible in the eastern sky at 2030hrs."
