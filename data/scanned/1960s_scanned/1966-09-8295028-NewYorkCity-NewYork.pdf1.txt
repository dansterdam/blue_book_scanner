PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE, TIME GROUP: 18 September 66 19/00:00Z
2. LOCATION: New York City, New York (Multiple)
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NATURE OF OBJECTS: Possible (BALLOON)
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2 Hours
6. COURSE OBSERVATION: The observers watched a heavy object that was dimmer than the moon and would not remain steady but it did move to the right and seemed to remain in one position and then it moved up and down and appeared brighter than the object. Considering the variable illumination it appears that the object was being used as an advertising gimmick. A large balloon held in place with a wire would become bright or dark depending on the angle of observation.
7. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
8. CONCLUSIONS: Possible (BALLOON)
