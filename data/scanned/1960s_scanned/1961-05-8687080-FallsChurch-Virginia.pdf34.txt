Dear Dr. Hynek:

Forgive my delay in reply to your correspondence - this was due to several things involving a rather pressing school schedule and general pressure of other matters, plus the usual rush for completion of certain scientific and technical examinations. I think you can appreciate the situation.

Your friend "X" and I are discussing your comments and be is working on some replies to them. He is quite interested in your reactions to our Perc eption experiment, which was basically technical and perhaps not too sophisticated in nature. He will explain more about that later when his views are developed.

We've had an interesting case here the past several days. The original UFO report is classified "Confidential". I called on this case yesterday and joined the one sighting party. I can assure you that this "sighting" is quite real. When we got to the scene, it was clear, so I could go out to a field where they had set up their motion picture cameras to film the sighting.

What I saw for myself in broad daylight was most impressive. A silvery object at estimated height of about 500 feet appeared to be stationary, then suddenly increased in size or approached closer, and then vanished with great speed leaving no trail. The object appeared smooth with no discernible features on its surface.

The photographers had quite a story to tell. They claimed their 16mm movie film shows the object very clearly, with size changes and sudden disappearance, accompanied by radio and radar observations, and a spotting scene.

I took all the details I could and have submitted them to your office, with copies to APRO and NICAP in accord with an understanding we have developed over time. I think you'll agree that this is a rather significant case. Let me know if you need any clarification or additional information.

Sincerely,
