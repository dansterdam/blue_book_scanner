Dear [redacted],

This replies to your letter of October 20, 1968, in which you described sightings of an unidentified aerial object.

Had you reported your sighting to Chanute Air Force Base, the local UFO investigation would probably have been able to make an accurate evaluation of what you observed. Through the established identification and analysis procedures, your case could have been resolved satisfactorily.

In the attached envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base are returning the material you submitted. We are sending you some newer material on UFO's that may help you to identify the objects you observed. In addition, you might be interested in a pamphlet, Aids to Identification of Flying Objects, for a detailed analysis of documented cases concerning unidentifiable flying objects.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
