There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire with text responses.

The text found in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
IT SLOWLY CLIMBED UP AND AWAY BEYOND MY VISION

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words, the following things about the object:
a. Sound   A SOFT WHIRRING SOUND, ALMOST UNNOTICEABLE
b. Color   BRIGHT WHITE, BRILLIANT, DISC-SHAPED, METALLIC LOOKING

18. We wish to know the angular size. Held a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
APPROX. 1/3 THE SIZE OF A MATCH HEAD

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, size, and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
