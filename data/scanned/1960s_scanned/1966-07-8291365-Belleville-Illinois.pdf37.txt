Belleville, Illinois
March 29, 1967

Gentlemen:

The following is a report of a UFO sighting on March 29, 1967 at approximately 6:30 PM. The object was first observed as a bright light at a high altitude, approximately 70-80 degrees above the horizon in the south. It appeared to be hovering and then moved in an easterly direction at a high rate of speed, disappearing from view in approximately 2-3 minutes. The object was observed by two individuals who were in the yard at the time. They described the object as being round in shape, approximately the size of a softball or larger, and emitting a bright light which appeared to pulsate at times. No sound was observed. Visibility was excellent at the time of the sighting.

Respectfully, I authorized the above information. It may be of interest to your organization and I shall be happy to provide any additional details if required.
