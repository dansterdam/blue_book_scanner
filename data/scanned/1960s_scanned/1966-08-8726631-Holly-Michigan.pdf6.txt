Dear Sir:

On August 4, 1966 I saw a UFO. However I think I saw a very common phenomenon, but what? I would like it if you send me a UFO form so that you might know and I might know what I saw. It could have been something strange but I doubt it. Also could you tell me if any other reports came in about that same date that my sighting took place?

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
