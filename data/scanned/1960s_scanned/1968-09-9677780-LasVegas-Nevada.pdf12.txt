DID THE PHENOMENON
YES NO UNKNOWN
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?  
MOVE STILL AT ANYTIME?  
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY? X
SEEM UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?  
CHANGE COLOR?  
GIVE OFF SMOKE?  
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?  
CHANGE SHAPE?  
FLASH OR PULSATE?  
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?  
SPIN LIKE A TOP?  
MAKE A NOISE?  X
IT STARTED SLOWLY AND THEN AS A RAPID INCREASE IN SPEED AND SEEMED TO MOVE AWAY BETWEEN PRIMARY POWER LINES RUNNING EAST & WEST BEHIND MY HOUSE. WHEN I NOTICED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A BRIGHT STAR MOVING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION. PERFECTLY PARALLEL TO ABOVE MENTIONED WIRES.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? EEXP (AND IF YES) DESCRIBE
