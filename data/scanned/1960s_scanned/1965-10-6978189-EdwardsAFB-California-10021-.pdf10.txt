The image appears to be a photographic negative or a scanned image of a photographic negative. It shows a rectangular frame in the center of the image, with what looks like a grid or crosshairs pattern overlaying the frame. The background is mostly white, with some speckling or graininess visible. There does not appear to be any clearly identifiable object or subject within the frame.
