The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text from the document is as follows:

"To Whom It May Concern

This will reply to your letter of June 7th reporting your unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

We appreciate your supplying us with the details of your unusual experience and will use the data in our letter for information purposes. At this time we do not have sufficient information to make an adequate analysis, and it is requested that you submit any other related information you may have for a more complete evaluation.

Your report has been forwarded to the nearest Air Force installation as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base installation for analysis. This routine processing is followed in all cases to insure that all available information is obtained.

What you saw was obviously unfamiliar to you. We define a UFO as an aerial phenomenon or object which is unknown or appears out of the ordinary to the observer.

A copy of the report on Project Blue Book is enclosed. I am certain it will be useful to you.

Sincerely,

BARNETT H. YOUNG, Lt Col, USAF
Civil Information Division
Office of Information
