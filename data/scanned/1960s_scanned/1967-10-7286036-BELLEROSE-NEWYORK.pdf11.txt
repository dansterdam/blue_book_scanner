1. The Aerial Phenomena Branch is investigating an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of 22 October 1957 from Bellerose, New York. The description of the object is consistent with that of an aerial advertising plane.

2. Information on whether there were any advertising planes in the area could be helpful in our evaluation.

3. We have enclosed a listing of aerial advertising planes that operate in the Eastern Region which may be of use to you. 

4. Thank you for any assistance you can provide on this observation.
