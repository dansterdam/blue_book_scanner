The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report documenting a UFO sighting. The text describes the incident, stating that the UFO was not as high as the Echo Satellites and that no sounds were heard. The report concludes that there is insufficient evidence or corroborating data available locally through open source material to positively identify the source of the UFO, and that the incident was possibly related to the launching of a Saturn 5 rocket from Cape Kennedy, Florida in November 1967.

Text output:

Another observer pointed out that the are of the UFO was not as 
high as the Echo Satellites he had observed. No sounds were 
heard relative to the UFO by any observers and none could give
any indication as to size, shape, color or brightness. Other 
other stations as reported to 7/13 AF TACC were visual. No 
radar sightings were reported.

4. Conclusion: Insufficient evidence or corroborating data
are available locally through open source material to positively 
identify the source of the UFO. No details as to the direction, altitude,
orbital path, or times and locations of stage separations were
listed in the local press. However, it is possible that the UFO 
incident as observed and reported in Thailand resulted from
a launch of the Saturn 5 rocket.
