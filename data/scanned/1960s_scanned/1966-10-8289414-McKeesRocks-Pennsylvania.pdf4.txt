As an OCR system, the text in the document is as follows:

"This was observed about 8:3 p.m. this date. Large object giving off varied colored lights, appeared to hover and change directions of flight, flying at a moderate speed. After 1/2 hour of observation this object departed, getting smaller and finally disappearing. Only one other witness who was a neighbor saw the same object and can verify my observation.

Clear at first appeared very low may have been a sapper much larger than my house, sometime it appeared to be a saucer shape and I could clearly see the lights on the underside changing color from red, green, and blue."
