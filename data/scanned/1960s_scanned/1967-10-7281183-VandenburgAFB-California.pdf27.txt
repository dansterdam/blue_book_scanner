Vandenberg Sighting Report

3

Not indicate that the object rose, and a balloon would rise at approximately 1,000 feet per minute. 

f. Yokobosty and Yaterian reported seeing an object that covered 45 degrees in a few seconds, making four zig zags and four zags, and then, after reappearing for one second, disappeared to the north.

g. This covers only the most interesting of the visual sightings.

2110 - Air Defense Command scrambled the first of three flights of fighters to investigate the situation. The first and third flights came from Ontario, California, and the second from Oxnard. At this time the tapes of the conversations with the radar sites and other bases gave evidence of a good deal of confusion but not alarm or panic. The fighters were handed off to VAIR (Ralston) by the FAA at LA and controlled locally. Ralston attempted to vector the fighters in on the bogeys although, according to Ralston, it was not possible to do a very systematic job of this. By the time the second flight came in, the controllers, because they were so busy with the aircraft, no longer observed any targets. They did observe a good deal of clutter in the west and southwest quadrant. Not bad, they said, about like you get when there is a choppy sea, but the winds that night were only 5 to 10 knots. None of the aircraft, saw anything. One pilot observed something on his IR detector, and, although he reported he could see it repeatedly, he could see it only at distance. As soon as he closed in, the object would disappear. Another aircraft did lock-on to a target, but, after investigation, it was found to be only a reflection.
