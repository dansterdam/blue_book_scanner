"There are several minor contrasts in the description. One observer stated that the object when it was directly overhead appeared to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. The object seemed to have a dull metallic surface and was rotating slowly. The object hovered over the area for several minutes, then accelerated to the east and completely disappeared. Another point of interest is that the object was observed again on 13 September. Another point of interest is that the object was at close range. The observers were near Lachine, Michigan. The object appeared to be guided in its movements and seemed to be under intelligent control. (See map) The observers also stated that they called the local police station. Two cars from the local police department and radar facility were requested from the observers but have never been returned. Another point of interest is the fact that one observer is very interested in UFOs and should like to make a careful investigation. On 7 November 1961, he has called information but was told that no additional information was available from the Air Force. To respond the sighting is being carried as Insufficient Data for Evaluation."
