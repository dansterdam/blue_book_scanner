Dear Sirs:

I would like to report seeing several unidentified flying objects sighted last Sunday (3/19/67) morning from 6:00 AM thru 6:45 AM. I live in Yonkers, N.Y. and made some film of the sightings from my 16th floor apartment window. The objects appeared to be flying or floating just above the sound. I would guess about 150 feet high. I made some 8 mm movie film but the objects came back several blurred. To the honest, I had really started thinking about the objects while making the film and got quite excited. However, I live on the 16th floor of a 19 story apartment building and although the objects were quite some distance away, my pictures will prove. 

I really wanted to what you feel I should do with these films. I will gladly write you a note again when I get the film back until then I hear from you.

Truly yours,
[Signature redacted]
