The shared image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

NOT has he an opinion as to what the object was, only that it was most unusual.

The undersigned is of the opinion that the complainant is a level-headed person, of good character and intelligence, and in my estimation he is a credible witness. However, it is that he did not report the incident his wife did, and it is believed that he would have been capable in the presentation of the facts, and able to supply additional details as to what he may have observed.

This case occurred all the information that the report has been based only incomplete, and no conclusions can be drawn relative to the above-mentioned sighting. However, the reporting officer indicated that the object could have been a conventional aircraft, but no such identification has been confirmed.

request any instructions/recommendations for further action that my be considered with regard to this matter.
