The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The text instructs the viewer to imagine various scenarios related to the sighting of an unidentified flying object, including the height of the object above the horizon, the direction it was traveling, and whether there were multiple objects. The text also provides instructions for drawing a picture to show the motion of the object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how low the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
