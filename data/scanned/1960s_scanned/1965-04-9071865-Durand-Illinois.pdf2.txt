Dear Major Quintanilla:

I would like to call to your attention an interesting object I observed flying fairly low in the sky (at perhaps 1000 feet) within 1/4 to 1/2 of a mile from me on the night of April 21, 1965. ...

The text then goes on to describe the witness's observation of the UFO in detail, including its appearance, behavior, and effects on the witness's vehicle. The letter ends with the witness expressing a willingness to cooperate with the investigation of this matter.
