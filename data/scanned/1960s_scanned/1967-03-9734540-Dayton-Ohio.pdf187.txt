The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document from the Department of the Air Force, describing an investigation of local sources related to an unidentified phenomenon. The document mentions that an interview with traffic control personnel at Sky Harbor Airport revealed that there are approximately 1200-1499 "sorties" (aircraft movements) per day, 200 of which are under positive control. It also states that this accounts for "low level maneuvers" seen in the area of the report.

Text from the document:

UNRFL IABLE SINCE LEWIS BIG JOHN SPEAKS LITTLE ENGLISH AND INTERPRE- TATION PROBLEMS EXIST. ALSO, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT LEWIS BIG JOHN HAS PAGE 3 RUNIJA GENS
SEEN AN AIRPLANE. INVESTIGATION OF LOCAL SOURCES REVEALED NOTHING THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE PHENOMENON. AN INTERVIEW WITH TRAFFIC HANDLING PERSONNEL AT SKY HARBOR AIRPORT, PHOENIX, REVEALED THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 1200 - 1499 SORTIES PER DAY, 200 OF WHICH ARE UNDER POSITIVE CONTROL. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS ACCOUNTS FOR LOW LEVEL MANEUVERS SEEN IN THE AREA OF THE REPORT.
