The image contains a compass diagram that appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The compass diagram is labeled with the cardinal directions and appears to be a reference for describing the orientation of a UFO sighting. Additionally, there are two sketches below the compass diagram that depict a landscape view, possibly showing the observed UFO in the sky.

NOW TESTING: YOU ARE THE CENTER OF THIS COMPASS. AS AN AID TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE SOURCE OF THE PHENOMENON, PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO BE MOVING.

PLACE A TIC AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A TIC AT THE POSITION WHEN LAST SEEN. IF THE PATH OF THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS SKETCH.
