Proposed reply to letter from Mrs. Gerald Greenlief, 26 January 1967

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

Reference your letter of 26 January 1967 concerning several unidentified flying object sightings by your husband and other individuals on those successive nights. Our office has received several reports of a bluish-green cloud on the morning of 16 June 1966. These reports were from Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and now Kentucky. A detailed investigation into the matter revealed that Eglin AFB, Florida was engaged in an upper atmosphere research study at the time of the sighting. A two-stage Nike-Iroquois rocket which contained a vaporized barium payload was launched at approximately 0543 CST 16 January 1967. At an altitude of approximately 100 miles, the barium payload was injected. This produced an enormous green vapor cloud which was visible for several hundred miles. The Public Information Office at Eglin informed our office that this cloud formed an elongated pattern along the lines of the earth's magnetic field and was visible for approximately 30 minutes.

The description in the news clipping you provided is quite similar to those we have already received concerning the 16 January 1967 early morning observation. Upper atmospheric research studies with sounding rockets have been responsible for numerous UFO observations.

As for the other sightings I can offer no comments without additional information. If you and your husband would complete the [redacted] 22 Feb 67.
