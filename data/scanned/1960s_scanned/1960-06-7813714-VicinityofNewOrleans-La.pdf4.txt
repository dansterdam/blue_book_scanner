Gentlemen:

"In connection with the article attached relative to the brilliant object sighted Tuesday night, June 22nd, I would like to relate details as follows for whatever value can be gleaned therefrom:

I was driving alone from Breaux Bridge, La., toward Parks, La., and as I approached about five miles out of Breaux Bridge, while headed in a southeasterly direction at approximately 50 MPH, I sighted a bright light ahead which at first I took to be some aircraft, but as I drew closer I realized it was an object just hovering in the sky. As I got to approximately within a mile, the object started to make a very fast, almost perpendicular, ascent and disappeared from view. As it ascended, it appeared bluish-green but after it cleared the tinted particulate matter in the atmosphere, the white light appeared brilliant and no longer bluish. I am quite sure this was the object referred to in the clipping, and that it came from my northward and that I saw the object descending some 10 to 15 seconds prior to its observed ascent and disappearance.

The first head-part fell with all similar to the first part. Other than that it is looked a bit different, I presume it was a motor which is always appears to be only five or ten miles away."

Yours very truly,
(Mr. Captain Air Transport
Command)
