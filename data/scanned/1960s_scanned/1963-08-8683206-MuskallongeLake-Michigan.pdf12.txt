Some land...
We came down and
then took off a-
gain up and to the
left a little. The
ob ject was large,
and round and dull
gray in color. It
seemed to be a-
bout 200 feet in
diameter and it had
a row of lights
a-round the edge.
The lights were
white in color and
they seemed to
flashing on and
off in a regular
pattern. The ob-
ject then seemed
to shrink down
and become smal-
ler and smaller
until it disappea-
red from sight.
