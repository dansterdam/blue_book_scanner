There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from an old document or report, containing handwritten text.

P.S.
This letter is and answer 
to your letter as soon as
possible. This is very important
and to me that this object has
been observed a number of times
I know so far about
Brooksville, Florida, the with
this object has ben seen 
several times. It is
higher than the trees, round
as saucer, has a steady brilliant
light, revolves and at times the
light may be or probably is turning
undergraduates or other military personnel, this
is a piercing high - pitched 
sound that comes from the
light as they were driving
an undetermined shade.
