The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

From the directions in the sky, and the probability calculated by the flash/boom time lag, the object sights should have manifested in the real book/kettering area, north or south of there.
