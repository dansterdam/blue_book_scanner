This was of the most visual case on record. It was a classic-type saucer, of about 50-75 feet in diameter, and gave off a luminous glow, about 6-8 inches thick. The object was estimated to be about 8,000 feet away and moving at an estimated speed of 200-300 miles per hour. This was observed for about 5-10 minutes.
