FLYING SAUCER SIGHTS
A Few Are Reported

Flying saucer sightings continue to be reported in various parts of the country. Several recent cases have been recorded by the Air Force, which investigates all such sightings.

Last week, a captain and lieutenant at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, reported seeing a strange object in the sky over their base. The object was described as a brilliant light which appeared to hover for a few minutes and then suddenly disappeared. 

Other recent reports have come from California, where two sightings were made on the same night. Witnesses in those cases described the objects as large, round and very bright.

So far this year, the Air Force has received several thousand reports of UFO sightings. Many of these turn out to be natural or man-made objects, but a small percentage remain unexplained.
