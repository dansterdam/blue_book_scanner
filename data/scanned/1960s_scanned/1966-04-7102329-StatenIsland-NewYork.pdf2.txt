Gentlemen:

Last night about 5:30 A.M. I was awaking up my phone that the World War II stores close to my home as a barrage of bombs or some threatening looking objects passing over our neighborhood at a very high speed, and the "something" was so bright that it was lighting up the whole neighborhood. I watched these objects for about 5 to 10 minutes and they were traveling towards the Bridge and out over the water.

The objects were quite large and round and appeared to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and they were glowing with an orange-red color. They were traveling in a wedge formation and when one made a turn, the others followed in unison.

This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this and could not believe my eyes. I have no idea what they were, but they certainly were not any kind of aircraft that I have ever seen before.

I would appreciate it very much if you would have someone investigate this incident and let me know the results. Thank you.

Sincerely,
