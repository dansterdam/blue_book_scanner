I would say this was the greatest experience ot my life. I come trom a tamily who have lived in this coas tal area tor many generations and have always been interested in the phenomena observed in the sky here. However, this was the closest and most spectacular instance I have ever encountered. The object was hovering at a distance at tirst , then it approached to within approximately 200 yards. It was round, glowing and quite large. Alter a tew minutes it flew away at absolutely incredible speed. Several ot my neighbors saw it also. I am convinced that this was no conventional airctatt. This phenomena, if occurring more frequently and under more controlled conditions, could be the basis of an important scientific investigation.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
April 27, 1956 To your (Air Force) Air Base at Portia nd, Maine
