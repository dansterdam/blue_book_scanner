A sighting over New York City of the magnitude and duration that Mr. described would have initiated many reports from that area; this is the that has been received by this installation. It appears that Mr. is describing what he has read and not actually saw. During his conversation with him, his description of his sighting would evolve to as he had read and not actually saw. He gave the impression of an elderly gentleman, a stranger in this country without any family and seeking attention.

I have enclosed a copy of his letter to the Base Commander at Stewart.

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs: None.
