The image appears to contain a photograph of a flying saucer or unidentified flying object (UFO). The caption states that the photograph was taken by Paul Remhilde, who was flying his plane at the time and claimed to have seen the object.

Photo Adds New Wrinkle to Saucers
By DOUGLAS BRADFORD
White Air Force officers revealed yesterday that they have been able through the crash experiments to acquire pictures of the strange aerial visitors that leave a wrinkle on their silver craft.
Paul Remhilde, 34, an Air Force Reserve officer from Macclenny, Fla., said he took the photograph at about 11:30 p.m. on March 16 while flying his private plane at about 5,000 feet over North of Macclenny.
Remhilde said the craft was hovering over a wooded area at an altitude of about 1,000 feet, and that he could clearly see a wrinkle or indentation on the surface of the disc-shaped object.
This is what Paul Remhilde's camera saw when he pointed it at the saucer-shaped flying object.
