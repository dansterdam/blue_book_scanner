APR 30-17(C)

RISE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?  
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND GO AWAY?
CHANGE COURSE?
GIVE OFF LIGHT? 
HAVE COLORED LIGHTS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
HAVE SOMETHING APPEAR?
SPLIT INTO PARTS?
LEAVE A TRAIL?
LAND? IS MORE
OBSERVE CAREFULLY WHAT CREW ATTENTION TO THE PHENOENENON?

I looked carefully for a previous sighting of this phenomenon and it seemed I saw it previously for a UFO over the Brooklyn area, and it finally disappeared.  So I looked like it was clearly a UFO.

A. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE SEEMING OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING? CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
THERE IS NOTHING TO KEEP RECORDING.
