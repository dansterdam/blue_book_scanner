The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text.

Here is the text from the document, as an OCR system would output it:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 12 - dg" /*$&

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

This object appeared to be white in color and seemed to have blach for dorks) markings on the side, the lower half appeared to be slightly rounded and had a light glow. It moved very slowly and did not appear to have a tremendous speed. The other witnesses also remarked abut the object and I assume to have a sighting of a goal object.
