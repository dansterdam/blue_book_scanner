REPORT
Date: Wednesday, April 6, 1966
Time: 0407Z, 2207C.
Location: 65th and Lloyd Street.
TYPE OF OBJECT: Bright light. Magnitude about - 2 or - 3. Size estimated to be about 1 to 2 feet and height but appeared to be approximately or slightly larger than the planet Jupiter or Venus.
COLOR AND APPEARANCE: Steady white - no additional colors, marks, or identifiable criterion.
SPEED: Estimated speed Mach 2 or 3. This is based on computations based on the figure of 2 1/2 miles distant. The object went from horizon to horizon in about 5 seconds. Course was substantially horizontal in a period of 3 to 5 seconds.
COURSE: This was a straight line course with no apparent variations. Course heading from zenith to 310° or 350°.
HEIGHT: The height of this object was estimated to be 14,000 to 16,000 feet M.S.L. Any possible error in this height was discounted due to an alto-cumulus layer (estimated at 6,000 to 8,000 M.S.L.).
