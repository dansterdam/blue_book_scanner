The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically a chart titled "DAILY TREND CHART FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1968". There does not appear to be any photograph included in this particular page.

The text on the page is as follows:

DAILY TREND CHART FOR THE
MONTH OF
NOVEMBER 1968

The chart includes a grid with various markings, including numbers and letters indicating "IDENTIFIED/PROBABLE IDENTIFICATION", "UNIDENTIFIED CATEGORY", and "INSUFFICIENT DATA". There are also annotations referring to "Place Monthly Count" and "side-by-side to relate overall trend".
