The light was stationary and very bright, appearing to be a bluish-white color. The light remained stationary for 5 to 7 minutes. It then began to move in a straight line, gaining speed rapidly. The speed was estimated to be in excess of 5,000 mph. The light traveled approximately 25 to 30 miles in the 5 to 7 minutes it was observed moving. The witness lost sight of the light when it passed behind a mountain ridge. He stated that the light appeared to be the size of a basketball at arm's length. The weather was clear and the visibility was unlimited.
