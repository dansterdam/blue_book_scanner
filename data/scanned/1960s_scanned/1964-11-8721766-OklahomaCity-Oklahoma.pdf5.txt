The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document or letter.

I appreciate the information which you have sent and you can be sure it will not be published.

I did feel that a follow up story was due on the September 1964 incident. As I told you while I was at NICAP, I felt that this matter could not be given full publicity without revealing some identifications which I had hoped to have cleared up before making them public. I do not believe they will be published in the future either.

I assure you to read the new issue of the NICAP article. I do not believe they will publish it, but I had to state our position - maybe they could have the articles as news for us.

You believes the UFO sighting is at St. Petersburg, and wrote a report about why she thought this, but have not received a reply. It must close for now.

Yours truly,
