BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON UFO SIGHTINGS FROM AUBURN, WASHINGTON

The following UFO sightings were submitted to the Air Force by an observer in Auburn, Washington:

28 June 1963 - 0000 hrs local, 0110 hrs "
29 June 1963 - 0020 hrs local, 0200 hrs "
30 June 1963 - 0040 hrs local, 0220 hrs, 2315 hrs "
1 July 1963 - 0050 hrs local, 0240 hrs, 2330 hrs "
2 July 1963 - 0110 hrs, 2340 hrs "

Because the sightings were of a moving star-like point-source of light, the information was given to the Space Defense Center (SDC) to determine if a satellite could be the stimulus. SDC ran a computer program using the above dates and times and determined that Cosmos 103 Rocket Body would have been visible from Auburn at the above specified times. Therefore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that this rocket body is the stimulus for the sightings.
