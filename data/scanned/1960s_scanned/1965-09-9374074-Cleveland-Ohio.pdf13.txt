Dear Sirs:
On the evening of Sept. 18, 1965 at 10:45 p.m. EST, my family and I sighted what appeared to be an aircraft traveling at a high rate of speed from the northeast to the southwest. The object traveled in a straight line, but its speed was considerably faster than that of any conventional aircraft we have ever seen.
The object appeared to be cylindrical in shape and emitted a brilliant glow of bluish-white light. It was traveling at an extremely high altitude and was completely silent. The object seemed to be approximately 200-300 feet long. We watched the object for about 30 minutes as it crossed the sky from northeast to southwest.
After the object disappeared from sight, we tried to find out if any unusual aircraft activity had been reported in the area, but no information was available. I am submitting this report in the hope that it may be of some value in your investigation of UFO sightings.
Sincerely,
