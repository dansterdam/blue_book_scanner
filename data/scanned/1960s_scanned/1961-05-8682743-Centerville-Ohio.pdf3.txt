The witness observed eight bright lights go together in a cluster. They were very bright and seemed to be much larger than the normal 15 degree size of the moon. About 30 minutes later, the lights disappeared. The witness stated that the lights appeared to be hovering and changing direction of flight at times. He also mentioned that the lights were extremely bright and that he could see the outlines and shapes of the objects even though it was dark outside.
