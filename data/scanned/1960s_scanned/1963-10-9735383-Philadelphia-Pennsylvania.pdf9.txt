The image contains a diagram or illustration related to a UFO sighting report. It appears to be a page from an old document or project blue book report. The diagram includes a sketch of a compass or direction indicator, as well as some instructions or questions for the observer to answer, such as indicating the direction of the observed object.

27. As the object moved across the sky, how high was the object above the horizon (altitude) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the diagram to show how high the object was above the horizon (altitude) when you first saw it. Place a "F" on the diagram to show how high the object was above the horizon (altitude) when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
