(Handwritten text):
The object was small and moved slowly due east. It had a bright light on the front and the rear that seemed to be reflected on the object. It had a white light all around about the size of a basketball. The motion was slow and steady until it faded from sight and disappeared to the east. There were no sound effects. The object was no more than a mile away and about 500 feet above the ground.
