Dear Major Hector Quintanilla:
You will find enclosed the photograph which I mentioned in my letter of March 1, 1967. As I stated, this photograph was taken by me on the evening of February 24, 1967, while I was in my backyard taking photographs of the trees and the sky. At approximately 6:30 p.m., I observed an unusual object in the sky which I quickly photographed. The object appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed and the photograph does not clearly show the details of the object.
I hope this photograph will be of some assistance in your investigation. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
