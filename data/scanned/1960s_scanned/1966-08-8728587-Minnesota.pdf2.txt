XIII. - Miscellaneous Comments of Observer
The object paralleled their course west on highway 3. They turned their course towards the east and the object did likewise. While following the object, they watched it until about 0400z when it went behind the trees. This object was round and had red, blue, and green lights on it. Occasionally, sparks like a welder's arc were seen emitting from the object. The object's rate of speed was estimated to be 500 miles per hour. How- ever, the object's size was such a comparison could be made and still only leave an estimate of its speed and not an accurate measurement.

Mr. A.B. said his mother, Mrs. A. Smith, and six companions observed an identical object that same evening between 0330 and 0400z in the western sky. A friend of one of them drank a pop and dropped the bottle, which was described. The object was similar in appearance to the one reported for Mr. and Mrs. C.

Mr. C. said that, about 0002, 9 Aug 66, he and 15 other persons, including his wife, observed a similar type object. They described movement as random with no set pattern, and a speed beyond comparison rate to anything the observer had seen previously. During one brisk, abrupt flight maneuver, the object was observed to stop abruptly and back up.

Additional Comments
This office called the St. Louis County Attorney's office, listed as county in the report, to ascertain if the telephone number of the man who reported the sightings was available. However, there was a traffic while attempting to make contact and the operator suggested calling back at a later time on the same date.
