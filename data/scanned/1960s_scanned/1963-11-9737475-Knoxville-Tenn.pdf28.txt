Dear Mr. [REDACTED]:

Your letter of October 21, 1963, regarding the report of unidentified aerial phenomena is the proper terminology for the subject.

We think it may be of interest to you. The Air Force utilization of the terminology "Unidentified Flying Objects" is no longer in official use. This was changed since it created an implication which is not justified by the public understanding or documentation field records of the Air Force. The Air Force designations are now and always have been available to bona fide scientific researchers.

Enclosed also is a copy of AFR 200-2 which sets up the procedures and explains the method of operation.

Because of the interest you indicated, "The World of Flying Saucers" which would provide you with information on this subject may be obtained by contacting the publishers and dissipating any misinformation you may have on this subject.

Sincerely,

MAJOR M. J. JACKS
