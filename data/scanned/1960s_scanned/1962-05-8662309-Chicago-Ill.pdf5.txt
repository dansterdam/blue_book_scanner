The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a text description of a UFO sighting. The text describes the following:

TOKUSHIMA-KEN, JAPAN, MAY 20, 1962
An observer saw three orange, glowing objects which approached and then receded at high speed. The objects were well-defined, saucer-shaped and glowing with a very brilliant orange. The objects appeared to be about 20-25 yards in diameter and of the same brightness for the duration of 3-4 min. (Note similarity to recent Fireball sighting).
