The image appears to contain a police photograph showing a massive indentation left in the ground, as mentioned in the text below the image. However, there is no human face visible in the image that would require me to avoid identifying or naming any individuals.

Now, as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

Hollenbv, Kirk McIaine, 
and Winston Perry, 32,

toward the Hayden home.
At the time we were

from the main house, the

louder. The three men
stopped dead, its lights went

glowed so brightly they were

Then suddenly it moved up 
into the sky.
"It disappeared completely 
in about 30 seconds," said 
Hollenbv. "When we got

discovered the bodies of 
Hayden and his wife and 
immediately called for help.
First to arrive at the scene
was Police Inspector Thomas

the kitchen floor," he said. 
"Both were nude with their

on their faces were horrible.
Not like they died in pain,
