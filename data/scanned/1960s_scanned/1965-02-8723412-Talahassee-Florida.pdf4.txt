The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed page from a UFO report document.

In view of the very limited response to our requests for information, one receives the definite impression that the anonymous sightings and encounters which gave rise to these statements were a good possibility that the entire incident was a hoax of some sort. Otherwise, it seems likely that more witnesses would have come forward with information which could have aided in the investigation.

5. Because both witnesses who were contacted stated that the sightings were carefully investigated by Eastern Air Lines and the Tower Operator at Jacksonville, PIA, cannot be completely discarded. However, there is at this time, no compelling evidence linking the sightings to the UTO alleged in the Tallahassee area.

6. Tyndall and Eglin AFB's reported negative activity of any type on or near the vicinity of Tallahassee, FLA, at the time of the UTO sighting.

7. This evidence thus far is deemed very unsatisfactory, vague, and inconclusive. In the absence of subpoena powers, it would appear that further attempts to secure statements from alleged witnesses would not justify the manhours and expenses involved. It is felt that further identification would be pure conjecture, and would be of no probative value. Therefore, it is recommended that this investigation be closed.
