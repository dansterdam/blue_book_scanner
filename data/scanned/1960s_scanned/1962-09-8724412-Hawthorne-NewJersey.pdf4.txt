The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

29 November 1952

Dear Mr. Lavel:

The sightings to which you refer in your letter of October 11th have never been officially reported to the Air Force according to our files. Therefore we are not able to offer an evaluation.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM J. LOCKANOO
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Chief, Investigations Division
