26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The object seemed oval in shape and silvery in color. It appeared to be rotating or spinning as it moved through the sky at a fairly rapid speed. There was no visible trail or exhaust coming from the object and it made no sound that I could hear. It seemed to be at a fairly high altitude, probably around 5,000 feet or more, and was moving in a generally southwesterly direction. The sighting only lasted for about 30 seconds to a minute before the object disappeared from view.
