I. PURPOSE:
To analyse the sample for organic components that would be foreign to earth samples.

II. FACTUAL DATA:
A sample of dirt was submitted to the Analytical Branch and assigned analysis branch number 35-53. An analysis (Marsh extract) was extracted with carbon tetrachloride and an infrared spectrum obtained. The spectrum showed the residue to be a typical hydrocarbon, similar to petroleum. The amount of oil extracted was on the order of 1%.

III. CONCLUSIONS:
The dirt sample was analyzed and found to contain a petroleum hydrocarbon base oil.
