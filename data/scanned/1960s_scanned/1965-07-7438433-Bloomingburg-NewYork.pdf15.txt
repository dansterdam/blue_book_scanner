Enclosed please find the recording tape involving the Unidentified Flying Object incident at Bloomingburg, New York. I add this to the correspondence, and I sincerly hope that it will be of some value for what it is worth.

Several rather obscure, perhaps, items are as follows:

Nancy Porrow stated that she related the incident to her shortly afterwards, while the paper (maileto) Record) quotes her as stating the other man (#####) was the first to relate the incident.

The girls said that they believed that the object was a 'Flying Saucer'. I know that they were perhaps a bit forestighted, but since the Air Force classifies UFO's as simply Unknown, I didn't want to disillusion them.

But I am enclosing you this tape, these two girls are purely innocent of any hoax. They're both two sweet kids, without mischievous intentions.

As stated in my conclusions of the tape, should the Air Force send out an investigator, I believe he should ask both the cloud cover conditions and my part. If it had been near the object it might have been of big influence on any conclusions.

I hereby turn all rights of the tape to the United States Air Force so do as they wish with it.

I also hope the the Air Force will contact me on any stated on the tape that is puzzling so I can assist on any relative issue.

Sincerely
