The image contains a photograph of an old document, presumably from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be a form with several questions and space for the observer to provide responses.

Here is the text from the form, transcribed as an OCR system:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? The object did not disappear, but faded out gradually.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   (No)   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One):   Yes   (No)   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound None
b. Color A chrome metallic color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with the known object and measure, if you had sufficient time at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please be sure beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[The image shows a sketch of what appears to be a disc-shaped object with no distinct features or exhaust trails.]
