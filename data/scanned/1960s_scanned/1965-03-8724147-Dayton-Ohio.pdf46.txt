The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, specifically a questionnaire. The text on the page seems to be a handwritten response to question 35, which asks for "Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting."

OCR Text:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: _____ Day _____ Month _____ Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object appeared to be about the size of a compact car and was shaped somewhat like two saucers placed base to base. It was brilliantly lighted and seemed to be rotating about a vertical axis. It moved in a zigzag or irregular fashion across the sky at a very high rate of speed. It disappeared almost directly overhead moving at a high rate of speed. It could not have been any conventional aircraft known to me. The flight pattern was not at all like an airplane or helicopter. The speed was extremely high and the rotating, zigzag motion was foreign to any known aircraft. I have never seen anything like it before. It appeared to be some kind of unconventional aircraft.
