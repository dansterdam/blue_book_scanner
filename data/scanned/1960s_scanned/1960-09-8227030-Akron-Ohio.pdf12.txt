AUTHOR'S SUMMARY
BACKGROUND
Project Blue Book was the designation of one of a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. It started in 1952, the third study of its kind, and it was the longest, running for nearly twenty-two years until its termination on 17 December 1969. 
The goal of Project Blue Book was to determine if UFOs were a threat to national security, and to scientifically analyze UFO-related data. 
At the time, all investigations and studies of UFOs by the U.S. Government were centralized at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, where Project Blue Book was headquartered. The project was initially managed by the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC).
This report covers the period from 1 January 1949 through 31 December 1969. It represents a review and analysis of the 12,618 UFO reports received and evaluated by Project Blue Book during that time.
