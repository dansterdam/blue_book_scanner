The image does not contain any photographs, but rather it shows two sketches illustrating visual perspectives. The first sketch depicts a curved line along which an object is moving, and instructions are provided to imagine the object at different positions along the line. The second sketch shows two larger views, one showing a person on a road and another showing a distant landscape.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (a dotted line). Then, place a "B" on the same curved line to show where the object was when you first saw it, and a "C" where it was when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
