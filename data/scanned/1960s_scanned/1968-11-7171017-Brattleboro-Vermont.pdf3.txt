There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document that appears to be part of a UFO report.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"the momentary display was seen passing above Brattleboro. They also kept low. They fly up and down and sideways. They make no sound.

One large Mr. U.D. had a white light in the center. As the lights came on top and red lights went on the bottom. Another I watched, flew from the north, along the western horizon, then toward the south. It was darker shaped with a circle of lights which seemed to revolve in a circle and it was plainly seen with no sound.

Wednesday the 23rd January at about 7:30 PM EST I went toward the first National Shopping Center there was a light white in color which I.D. - It merely hung in."
