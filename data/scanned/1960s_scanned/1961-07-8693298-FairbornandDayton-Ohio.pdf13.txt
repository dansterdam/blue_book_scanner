The image does not contain any photographs, but rather contains two sketches or drawings. The larger sketch on the bottom shows a landscape view, while the smaller sketch on the top right shows a curved horizon line.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Please an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was at when you first saw it, and an "B" at the position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
