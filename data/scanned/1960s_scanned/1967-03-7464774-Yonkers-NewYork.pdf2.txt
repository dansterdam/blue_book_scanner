Dear Sir:
In March of this year I notified your department of an unusual sighting and subsequent 8 mm movie films I made of this sighting. I was advised by your office to fill out a questionnaire and file it to your command for evaluation. I was further advised that my film could be forwarded to an analysis unit at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for an analysis. As of this date I have had no reply from you other than an answer to an inquiry made several months ago. Due to the number of unusual sightings being made there was a slight delay in the processing of your film. I believe that six months is simply too long for your people to examine a film submitted for your evaluation. The film I have sent you and while you may for some reason be reluctant to offer an explanation (for unable to) I should greatly appreciate the return of the film at your earliest possible convenience.
I look forward to hear from you at your earliest possible convenience.
