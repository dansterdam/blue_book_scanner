37.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other objects?
My other sightings took place: in 1958 in Bothell, Washington; in 1959 in Everett, Washington; and in April 1960 in Bothell, Washington. All sightings of similar unidentified objects.

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
It seems to have been a flying object, the town 30 miles north of the report seems to have had some connection to a nearby airbase, but I doubt that it was a conventional aircraft. I am not certain but it could have been some kind of experimental aircraft or missile being tested in that area.
