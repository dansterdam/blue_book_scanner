1. Answers to report have implied that there may be some distortion or warping, and that the quality of the negatives and prints may not be clear enough to determine just what the objects could be. Small spots, apparently flaws in the negatives, could perhaps be nothing more than normal technical faults. The significant question appears to be the nature of the image itself, and whether it could be interpreted as indicating something unusual compared to the normal characteristics of an aerial phenomena caused by known factors. Any opinion or explanation as a view of the image must necessarily be inconclusive without more complete analysis.
