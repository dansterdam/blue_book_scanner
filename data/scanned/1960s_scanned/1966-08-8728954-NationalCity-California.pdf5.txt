Bright Meteor Flashes Over Pennsylvania, Ohio
PITTSBURGH (UPI) - A bright meteor flashing through the sky surprised hundreds of persons in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio Tuesday night.
Spokesmen at the Allegheny Observatory said the meteor was at a very low altitude and seemed to be falling at an angle. It glowed brightly red and its trail was visible for four seconds, they said.
Police reported receiving numerous calls from persons reporting the meteor passing.
A police man at Lockbourne Air Force Base near Columbus, Ohio said the meteor could be seen clearly from the base. Observers at the Allegheny Observatory said the meteor appeared in the southern sky, traveled west to east, and disappeared in the east.
The observatory reported the meteor covered an area of more than 150 square miles. It appeared as bright as the full moon.
