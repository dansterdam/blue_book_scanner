35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Saucer-shaped object, white or silvery, watching the ground. It appeared to zig-zag and disappear and reappear. The object moved in an erratic manner, often stopping in flight. It seemed to have a special attraction or interest in the area, as I watched it for an extended period of time, passing overhead and maneuvering around at low altitudes. At one point a second object appeared, which also maneuvered in the same erratic fashion as the first. Both objects seemed to have some kind of bluish-green glow around their perimeter. I was not in any danger, but was fascinated by this display and observed it for a long time until it disappeared from sight.
