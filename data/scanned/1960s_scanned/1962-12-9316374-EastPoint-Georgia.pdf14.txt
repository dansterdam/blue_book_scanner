The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I have produced the following text from the document:

I have hesitated to write you since the observation which was made near East Point, Georgia on March 27, 1962.

This observation was made by my wife and myself. We were standing in our backyard looking up at the sky when I noticed a bright light in the northeastern part of the sky. This light appeared to be moving very rapidly and zig-zagging back and forth.

I called my wife's attention to it and she also saw the object. It appeared to be approximately 500 to 1,000 feet in the air and was very brilliant and distinct. It made no sound that we could hear. It seemed to be traveling in a northeasterly direction when it suddenly stopped, hovered for a moment, and then started moving again in a southerly direction. It continued this maneuver for about five minutes, then suddenly disappeared from sight.

It is difficult for me to estimate the size of the object, but I would say it appeared to be about the size of a car. The color was a brilliant white, and it seemed to pulsate or throb at times. I am convinced that what we saw was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional type of aircraft. I have spent a number of years in the Air Force, and I am quite familiar with most types of aircraft. This was definitely something out of the ordinary.

I called the AF base here in Atlanta the next day and reported the incident. The officer with whom I talked was quite interested and took down all the details. He said the object was probably a "UFO" and that he would send a report to your office. I hope this information will be of some value to you.
