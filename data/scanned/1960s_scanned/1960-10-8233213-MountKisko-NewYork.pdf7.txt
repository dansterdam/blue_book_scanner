Dear Sirs:

About 7:55 p.m. approximately, Wednesday, October 5, 1960, I was in my yard when I was attracted by a very bright light up in the sky. It appeared to be several hundred feet in the air and was moving towards me, rather slowly, coming to a stop about 3\4 of a mile from where I was standing. It was about as bright as a star, moving across the sky, and then stopped hovering. I had the distinct feeling that it had spotted me and was waiting and watching me, for it remained stationary for about 5 minutes, then it moved off to the West very rapidly. 

It was a bright, clear night and the object was easily visible. It was perfectly round, appearing to be about the size of a golf ball held at arm's length. The color was a very bright white or blue-white, no other colors being visible. It made no sound whatever. I have seen many unusual lights in the sky before, but this was by far the most impressive and closest I have ever seen. It greatly impressed me at the time, and I have wondered about it ever since. Do you feel this is worthy of investigation? I believe it was probably a satellite or missile of some kind, but I have never seen one behave in that manner.

I have no particulat theories regarding the "how" or "why" of this phenomenon, and I submit it to you simply as a matter of record of what I observed. I hope this is of some value to you in your investigations. If you have any questions, I will be happy to try to answer them.

Sincerely yours,
