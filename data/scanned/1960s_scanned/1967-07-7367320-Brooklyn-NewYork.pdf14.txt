The flasher apparently emanated from a site extremely far away. It was a clear night, although it had rained the night before. The light of the flasher had a bright temperature between 55-65 degrees. If there would be another occurrence of this phenomenon, the writer would report it to you.

The morning of July 7, 1967 was almost a perfect match of the preceding one, incident for instance. A light whose color was extremely bright strokes of light were noticed, their point of origin apparently a large ball (apparently, it had 2 dimensions). Again, there was no sound and no interference with radio reception.

The writer sincerely hopes this information can be of assistance in understanding this wonderful world.
