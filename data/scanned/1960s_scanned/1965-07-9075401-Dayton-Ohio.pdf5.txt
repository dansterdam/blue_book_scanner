Warminster...

(Continued from page 7)

On August 25th, a photograph of the "thing" was reportedly taken. Carried in man's hat, brim turned down, and top crushed with a large central crease, the photo resembles "rather deeply-set eyes, with large wide-set and small iris stone oval opening." The photographer, a young man (23) Gordon Faulkner, a factory worker, said this happened on the 25th. In early evening, he stepped out of the back door of his home, on his way to see his sister had asked to borrow a ring. He shut the door behind him and saw the "thing" over the south of Warminster, he said he could just make out the unusual shape, focused his camera and pressed the trigger as the object entered the view-finder. Faulkner said: "It was as bright as the sun, and as small a size. I took one film, it shook me when I saw what came out of it all."

Faulkner then sent the photograph (after developing) to the Warminster Times, who returned it, saying they couldn't publish it. The September 11, 1965 issue of the Daily Mirror presented another photograph, "apparently that of a human being jumping off his bike and quickly focussing a camera" which was claimed captured the same "thing," according to coombe a resident of 33, St Mudjid-road, Battersea, London, on Monday, September 6th. Coombe claimed this photo did not resemble the "thing" Faulkner saw. Then Coombe says he doesn't claim to know what the "thing" was, but wants to know if and when permission is secured to present this bulletin, if they wish such exposure, they will be presented with documentation.
