There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a typewritten letter on project blue book that discusses unidentified flying objects and states that there are no photographs or other evidence submitted for this particular case.

Dear Mr. ****,

Unidentified flying objects, as you know, are not classified on Project Blue Book. This is the current report on Blue Book which will answer the questions posed in your letter.

There are no photographs or other evidence submitted for this case. The radar reports submitted were determined to be a misinterpretation of natural or conventional objects.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
