"30 October 1961

Dear Mr. -----,

Your recent letter to the Department of Defense has been referred to the Air Force.

The unidentified flying object report you queried about is being investigated, but no definite determination as to the nature of the sightings in that area at that time have been reported.

I am enclosing several questionnaires which we would appreciate your completing and returning to us. Any unusual details or comments you should have any newspaper clippings or other information pertaining to this matter, it would be appreciated if you could forward them to us.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated. 

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
Major, USAF
Deputy Chief Information Division
