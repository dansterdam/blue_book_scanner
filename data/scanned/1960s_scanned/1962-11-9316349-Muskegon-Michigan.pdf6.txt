NO Case (Information Only)                         9 November 1962 
Tucuman, Argentina

RELEASE ON A ROAD NEAR THE TOWN OF TUCUMAN SEVERAL YOUTHS WERE SITTING IN 
THEIR CARS ABOUT 11:30 PM WHEN THEY NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT COMING FROM THE OPPOSITE 
DIRECTION. THE OBJECT STOPPED BY AN INTENSE WHITE LIGHT AND THE STARTING MOTOR OF THE 
CARS. AFTERWARDS THEY NOTICED THAT THE CARS CLOSE ACROSS THE HIGHWAY WERE ALSO STOPPED. 
ABOUT 21 YARDS FROM THEM AND VERY SILENT, IN A SOFT GLOW, A LIGHTED DISC-SHAPED OBJECT 
DESCENDED CLOSE TO THE GROUND, ILLUMINATING THEIR AREA. AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES THE 
OBJECT TOOK OFF AGAIN VERTICALLY AT HIGH SPEED. LATER THEY FOUND THAT THEIR SKIN WAS 
BURNING.
THE UFO THEN ASCENDED TO A HEIGHT OF 30 YARDS ABOVE THE GROUND WHERE IT REMAINED 
STATIONARY FOR A WHILE. THEN IT SHOT UP LIKE A METEOR AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.
A SECOND OBJECT WAS OBSERVED LANDING AT A DISTANCE. IT WAS FOUND THAT A DEPRESSION 
HAD BEEN MADE ON THE GROUND WHERE IT HAD LANDED, ABOUT 2 METERS IN DIAMETER. TRACES OF 
A BURNING WERE NOTED WHICH LOOKED LIKE THEY HAD BEEN MADE BY A TORCH OR OTHER THERMAL 
SOURCE. THE OBJECT DEPARTED AT HIGH SPEED AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES.
