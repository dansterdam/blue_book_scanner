Tries to Quell Disturbances

Hynek Swamps It
To Study UFO's
Following Report
By DAVID L. NELSON

Trudging through swamps in southern Michigan may not be
the usual recreation of Western Michigan's first academic
Allen Hynek took it in stride, as he attempted to quell disturbances
of a national level.
The astronomy department chairman is also the chief scientific 
consultant to the U.S. Air Force on the subject of unidentified 
flying objects.

In the last week-and-a-half a rash of strange sightings has been
reported throughout the Midwest area, primarily in Michigan.
House Republicans have "a full blown investigation" into these incidents,
Congress have "a full blown investigation" into these incidents,
and Hynek swamps it to study the sightings.
