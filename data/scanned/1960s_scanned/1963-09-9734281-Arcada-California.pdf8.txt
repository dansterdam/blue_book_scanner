THE BEND BULLETIN

BEND, OREGON

October 23, 1963.

Captain Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Captain Quintanilla:

Dr. J. E. McDonald of the University of Arizona has forwarded to me your letter relative to the unusual sightings in southern Oregon and northern California on September 3.

So far as I am able to ascertain, the object was not sighted in the Bend, Oregon, area. I saw no mention in local newspapers, or on radio news.

Dr. McDonald reports that he is without information.

Kindest regards,
Phil F. Brogan
