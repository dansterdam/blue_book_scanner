SUBJECT: Investigation of Reports by Mr. Ronald Vetten, Fosterdale, N.Y.

1. On 4 May 1964, 1330 (1:30 PM) 
1. In compliance with Special Order M-116 (Attachment 1) and in accordance with JANAP 146 a complete report was made on a contact (UFO sighting) by Mr. Ronald Vetten, Fosterdale, N.Y.
2. The following observations were made during my interview with Mr. Vetten on 4 May 1964:
a. Mr. Vetten is a high school student, residing with his parents on a farm. He reported that he has above average intelligence.
b. He described a circular, flashing, silvery object in observing during daylight hours in clear weather. He estimated that the object was at an altitude of about 1000 feet and approximately 1/4 mile distant. He stated that the object appeared to be oscillating or "wobbling" and that it would occasionally stop, then resume its movement. He said the object was visible for about 30 minutes.
c. I was impressed with Mr. Vetten's sincerity and apparent intelligence. He seemed quite concerned about his observation and was cooperative during the interview.
3. On 5 September 1964, field investigation was conducted at the site. No physical evidence or residual effects were found.
