The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with text and form fields.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Faded slowly, to the west vicinity

15. Did the object move behind something or at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):     Yes    No    Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):  Yes    No    Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound  Hone
b. Color  Green (Fo)

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or a pencil length in line with a known object and how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
