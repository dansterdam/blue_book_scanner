The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Proposed reply to correspondence from Chuck Thaxton on his UFO observation and subsequent photograph of August 9, 1966

Dear Mr. Thaxton,

Reference your correspondence of July 7 concerning your photograph of an unidentified flying object. The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) recently contacted our office concerning the status of your photographs. They were informed that we have not received your negatives.

We have thoroughly searched for the negatives but have been unable to locate it. Since you have already provided the necessary camera data we would appreciate the opportunity to review your photograph, before reaching our final conclusion.

Your interest in the project is appreciated.
