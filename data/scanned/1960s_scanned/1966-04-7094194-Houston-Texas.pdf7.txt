UFO "Joke" Launched by Rice U. Students

The "unidentified flying object" that excited Southwest Houston Friday night was two weather balloons rigged with railroad flares and an aluminum foil device. The device was put together in the room of Robert Vansant, 18, an engineering freshman at Rice University. Vansant and some other students sent up the "UFO" as a joke. 

It was nearly a freak feeling when it lifted off the ground. We think it's going off as a joke," Vansant said. He said the device consisted of two balloons about 3% feet in diameter, carrying a wood and aluminum frame about 4 feet in diameter with an aluminum foil covering. 

He said the hydrogen-filled balloons should have climbed to a height of several hundred feet after the railroad flares burned out. "It should have gone high enough that the balloons burst from inside pressure," he said.

Vansant said he was assisted by freshmen engineering students John Sackett, David Beakman, James DePillo, Harold Magnus, Teretchler, Huckaby and John Trochesset.

Switchboards of police, newspapers, radio and television stations were flooded with calls about a UFO sighted shortly after 10 p.m. Friday by residents and motorists near the Shepherd Drive-Southwest Freeway area.
