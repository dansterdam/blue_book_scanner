Dear Sir:

The observations you made in January 1964 are similar to many reports of satellites received by the Air Force. Satellites scheduled for launch during this period were visible one time as this document indicates they would be.

We are attaching a brochure describing the Air Force program on unidentified flying objects. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

MAJOR GUSTAFATELLA, JR
CHIEF, PROGRAM BLUE BOOK
