Fishing and Hunting

Some of the best trout fishing in the West is in Montana's streams, - the Missouri, Gallatin, Big Horn and Madison Rivers in the Bob Marshall Wilderness and in Yellowstone Park - with their many tributaries. The high mountain lakes and streams offer fine trout and grayling fishing.

Hunters also find Montana a sportsman's paradise. Big game, such as elk, deer, antelope and bear abound in the mountainous regions, and upland game birds, waterfowl and migratory birds are plentiful. Good pheasant and Hungarian partridge hunting is available in some areas, natural conditions provide ideal habitat.

Of special interest is the Lewis and Clark Caverns, Montana's first state park, near Three Forks, Montana. These caverns, discovered in 1892 and developed as a state park in 1937, lie between Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks. Lewis and Clark passed through this area, so the caverns provide a glimpse of the explorers' journey. The caverns offer fascinating and unusual sights and provide a pleasant and comfortable place to visit. An open-air jeep railroad runs through the caverns for over a mile. The caverns maintain a year-round temperature of 46ยบ, well ventilated and comfortable to visit. An entrance fee is charged - free for children.
