"UFO LANDING AT AIR FORCE BASE
Splitting Disc Seen in Arkansas

The following report is forwarded by the Commanding Officer of the Arkansas Headquarters of the Civil Air Patrol as a result of an interview with the observer at a point near Blytheville, Arkansas, on 7 January 1964.

On the evening of Tuesday, 7 January 1964, at approximately 7:55 p.m., CST, a Lt Col (Pilot) attached to the 97th Bomb Wing at Blytheville AFB, Arkansas, was returning to the base from a routine navigation training mission. He was familiar with the area, having been the instructor pilot on approximately 700 similar training flights.

As he approached the base at an altitude of approximately 1,500 feet, he noticed a strange object in the northern sky, which he described as "a bright, metallic, circular object, about 25-30 feet in diameter, with a red light centered in the lower portion of the object." He immediately notified the Blytheville AFB control tower of the object, and was informed that the object was also visible on the tower's radar scope.

The Lt Col made several rapid turns in an attempt to close the distance to the object, but it disappeared momentarily. It then reappeared and proceeded in a southeasterly direction at a high rate of speed, covering the distance of approximately 8 miles in about 4-5 seconds. The Lt Col stated that the object appeared to be hovering momentarily, and then accelerated at an unbelievable rate of speed. After it had disappeared from his view, he reported the incident to the base operations officer.

Further questioning revealed the following additional details:

1. The object was observed for approximately 4-5 minutes.
2. The object was sighted at an estimated altitude of 3,000-4,000 feet.
3. The object was described as bright metallic, circular in shape, approximately 25-30 feet in diameter, with a red light centered in the lower portion.
4. The object moved in a jerky, irregular manner, and at one point appeared to hover momentarily.
5. The object accelerated to a very high rate of speed in a southeasterly direction, covering approximately 8 miles in 4-5 seconds.
6. The object was clearly visible to the pilot, who was familiar with the area, and was also observed on the Blytheville AFB control tower radar scope.

The observer is considered to be a reliable and credible individual, with an extensive background in aviation. His report is forwarded for your information."
