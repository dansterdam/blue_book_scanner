Thursday evening, April 15, 1965, students in my drawing class, about 15 of them, were playing around doodling, drawing etc. The lights were out and the room was in semi-darkness. About 7:30 p.m. a student noticed a bright object in the sky through the west windows. The object was spinning rapidly and emitting a bright glow. It appeared to be about 30-40 feet in diameter. It moved slowly towards the horizon and then rapidly accelerated out of sight. The students mentioned above all saw it and were excited and described it as I have above. No photograph was taken as it happened so rapidly. After the incident, the students mentioned above were questioned and they all corroborated the story. The horizon was clear and visibility good. No jet or aircraft of any kind was noted in the area at the time. The object moved in a horizontal course and was above the tree line. The students were all very excited and frightened by the incident. I would be pleased to discuss this further if you have any other questions.
