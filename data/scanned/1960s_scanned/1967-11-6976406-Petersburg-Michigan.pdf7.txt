The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or form from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document:

This information which you feel is pertinent but which is not adequately covered in this questionnaire. 

There was an observation of an object which apparently has some degree of intelligence. This was witnessed by several trained observers and the observation was made in clear weather with good visability. They were able to observe it quite closely for a considerable time and could make out details. The object appeared to be powered and capable of very high speed and maneuver ability. It did not make a sound and was seen to go off in any direction and stop at any time. It was bright as compared to the sky and sharply defined. When it started off, it seemed to accelerate instantly and when it stopped, it did so instantly. There was no evidence of any exhaust or propelling mechanism. 

I feel that this is an important subject worthy of thorough investigation, and I would appreciate any information you can give me relative to it.
