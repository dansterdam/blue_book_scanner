There does not appear to be any photograph present in the given image. It seems to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing handwritten text.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

This case report must await further investigation. but it is apparent that for a space of some 120 yards, some object traveled nearly horizontally, made contact with the earth, produced a considerable luminous phenomenon, and then disappeared to the extent that no tangible evidence of it could ever be found other than that already mentioned was found in the area. No indication reading were obtained because of lack of equipment.

One would like to wipe this case off the books, so to speak, by proving definitely that it was a missile fired from some aircraft. This is about the only logical, normal explanation, since it was traveling far beyond normal motions specially for a freight falling body, and its path far from vertical. The lack of tangible remains is likewise hard to explain on this hypothesis. Furthermore, was there no indication of any land-based or air-based rocket firing not only on that night but on any night at that season.

One might like to explain this as a meteorite, but most certainly a meteorite would have been visible long before it reached the ground and would have fallen much more vertically than horizontally. Indeed, after terminal velocity takes hold of a meteorite, it simply falls to the ground as though dropped from some point in the vicinity of the landing place.

If we wish to be fanciful - or perhaps we should not say fanciful - but careful may in the sensex not that it doesn't fit all the facts - but because our minds are completely unable to match the scene that just as we may we fine another answer.
