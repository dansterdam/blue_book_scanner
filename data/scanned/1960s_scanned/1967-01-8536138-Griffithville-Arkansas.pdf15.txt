"Dear Mr. ---,

Reference your correspondence regarding your unusual observation of January 1967. Extensive additional investigation has been conducted at this time. If you had reported the observation to us shortly after you observed the phenomena, a meaningful scientific investigation would have been possible.

A check of our records did not reveal any other sightings from the Florida Keys area in early January 1967. Your sighting will be filed for information purposes. 

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
