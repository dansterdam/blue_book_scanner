11. COMMENTS  This report does not contain sufficient evidence to determine what the witness saw. It is highly probable that the object was simply an aircraft, which was misidentified. The object was first seen about 30 minutes after sunset and was the only object seen. The movement and maneuvering described are typical of an aircraft. There is no evidence that this object was anything other than a normal aircraft.
