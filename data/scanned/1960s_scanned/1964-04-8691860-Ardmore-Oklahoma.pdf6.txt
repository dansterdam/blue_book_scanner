Dear Sir:

Thank you for acknowledging the sketch submitted. Since the details similar sketches submitted have been determined to be of such a nature that they do not warrant further evaluation due to lapse of time, and fact that I do not have a photographic or scientific mind, it does not appear that consideration of your evaluation could be of much technical value.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
