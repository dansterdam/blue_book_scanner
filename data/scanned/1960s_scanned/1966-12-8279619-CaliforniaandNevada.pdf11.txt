Shanadix Corporation is planning another series of high altitude rocket firings beginning at sunset, Monday, December 5, at the Tonopah Test Range, Tonopah, Nevada. The series of meteorological sounding rockets will carry payloads of trimethylaluminum (TMA) which will produce bright blue-green clouds that should be visible as far as 200-300 miles away, and should linger as bright streaks through the sky for at least an hour. 

It is probable that the luminous streaks will be visible as far away as San Francisco and Albuquerque. A similar test conducted in the Hawaiian Islands was seen by a commercial airlines pilot shortly after he left San Francisco, some 4,000 miles away. During a similar test in April of this year at the Tonopah Test Range, the visible cloud moved to the San Francisco Bay area and caused some concern among residents in that area.

The purpose of the tests is to measure wind velocity and directions at altitudes from 50-100 miles high. The TMA trails will be photographed by stations located at China Lake, California; Hawthorne, Nevada; and Cedar City, Utah. Nike-Cajun rocket systems will be used to carry the TMA payloads. The present schedule calls for shots at 5:10 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, December 5-7. All schedules are dependent on weather and cloud conditions and shots may go at any time during the week.
