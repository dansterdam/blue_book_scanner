The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

No air traffic at Keesler AFB or Gulfport Municipal airport from several hours before sighting until the next morning.
Capt Charles O. Williams, SAGE Weapons Controller Course, OGBD#4b, measured the distance to the targets and established that they were 10-12 miles away from the observer. The witness said "Approximately 10 years ago I had seen anything like this before." He stopped the truck he was driving and observed them for approximately 30 seconds.
I have not been able to determine any possible cause for this sighting. There were no balloons, search lights, or fireworks. There were no aircraft. There were no temperature inversions.
