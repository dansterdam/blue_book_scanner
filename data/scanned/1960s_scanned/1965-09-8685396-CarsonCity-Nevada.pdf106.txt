OKLAHOMA CITY TIMES 7* THURSDAY. JULY 22 1965

WIN ALL EXPENSE PAID TRIP TO LOS ANGELES TO ATTEND

Disappointed Citizen's a CFUFor Now 

Hopeful Gazer Draws Blank 

THE SNFBS had a case last night that left some new members Tuesday. His also is eligible for membership in the CFUFO lodge. 

The case was rather simple.It seems that a bunch of Oklahoman s were present at a place called Carson City, Nevada, on the night of Aug. 29. 1964. while the "light angle" was based upon a originally published report. 

One anxious moment came when one of the group thought he had sighted something in the sky. But after studying it for over an hour and a half, it turned out to be nothing more than a star, while the rest of the group were present at the time. 

It seems there are no verified film of photographs of this new tale of UFO - some of the disappointed Oklahomans were present at this particular sighting, and they reported the "hopeful gazer" in this case did not catch anything on film. 

There's not a bright "spur" to this new tale of UFOs - it brought back memories from a first of the flying saucer films ever made - "The Disappearance".

Some Oklahoma Citysns breathed good sigh of relief, as they had watched the skies in the past for the first time in years.
