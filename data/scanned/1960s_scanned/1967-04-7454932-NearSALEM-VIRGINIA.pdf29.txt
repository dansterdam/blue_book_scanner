The image contains a questionnaire titled "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE" with various fields to be filled out. There is a diagram in the bottom portion of the form, which appears to be asking the observer to draw an angle or trajectory of the observed unidentified phenomenon.

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE ABOUT ANY UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WHICH YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED. THE DATA COLLECTED WILL BE USED IN THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OFUNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS BY PROJECT "BLUE BOOK" . YOUR NAME WILL NOT BE USED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF YOUR STATEMENTS OR CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE. PLEASE FILL OUT THIS FORM AS COMPLETELY AS POSSIBLE AND RETURN IT TO THIS OFFICE. (ATTACH SKETCHES, DRAWINGS, OR PHOTOGRAPHS TO THIS FORM OR ANNOTATE WITH YOUR NAME FOR IDENTIFICATION.)
