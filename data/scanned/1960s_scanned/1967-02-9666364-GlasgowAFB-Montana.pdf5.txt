Dear Mr. Low,

Reference my telephone conversation with Miss McKelvey concerning a radar-visual observation from Glasgow AFB, Montana. I enclose a photofluorographic information on the 25 February 1967 sighting.

We had requested more information on the radar portion of the sighting but the data indicates only that a radar contact was made. The duration, however, seems to indicate the target was tracked for only one-two minutes while the radar sighting was in excess of that time.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM E. HARTLEY, Jr. 1st Lt USAF
Asst Chief, Project Blue Book
