IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 9, 1966

AIR FORCE TO CONTRACT WITH SCIENTISTS
FOR UFO INVESTIGATIONS

The Air Force is taking steps to strengthen scientific investigations of reports of sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFO).

The help of more individuals within the scientific community is being sought through contracts calling for prompt, in-depth investigations of selected UFO reports. Air Force officials are now discussing the interest with university and other scientific leaders to determine the most effective approach.

The decision to award the contracts was based on a recommendation by the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board which reviewed the methods and findings of Project Blue Book - the Air Force program to investigate and evaluate UFO reports.

In its report, which was submitted to the Air Force in March, the investigating committee recommended expanding the program to include investigations of selected sightings by independent scientists. The report also concluded that there has been no evidence that unidentified flying objects are a threat to national security, and commended the Air Force for its organization of Project Blue Book.

The Air Force is preparing work statements for the new contracts. Funds for them will be requested from FY 67 and FY 68 budgets.
