Mrs. U. S. Hignite, 191 person living at the time. She stated her location was about one and one-half miles east of Beech Corner, when this large, bright object came over a field on her left. It seemed to have many green and blue lights on it.

It is our understanding that the U. S. Air Force has a compilation of reports on U.F.O. sightings, and it was determined that Mrs. Cook considered a contact which could not be established with her until 1305 hours on November 17, 1967.
