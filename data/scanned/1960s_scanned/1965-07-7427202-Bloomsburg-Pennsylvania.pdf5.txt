Dear Sir:

This is in reference to the clipping on the Atlantic observations of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which was forwarded to this office for inclusion in Project Blue Book files. 

It is requested that you provide any additional information and details that you may have regarding this observation, to include the date, time, location, description of the object(s), and the number of witnesses. This information is needed in order to investigate reports such as this and to include in Project Blue Book files.

Several important items of data were missing from your letter regarding your observation of 4 July 1965. We have not received a completed UFO report form 14 in order to evaluate the sighting. We have not received a photograph, if one was obtained. Please forward this information at your earliest convenience.

If you are thinking of reporting on Project Blue Book, which will explain in detail the procedures to follow, we would appreciate receiving a copy of your report.

Sincerely,

Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
Chief, Project Blue Book
