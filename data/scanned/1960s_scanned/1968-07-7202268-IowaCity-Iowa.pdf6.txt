Dear Sir:

I wish to send me an official U. S. Air Force UFO form since I was an unidentified lighting reported over Iowa City, Iowa, Sometime ago. Though it has been a UFO, it did not demonstrate any characteristic behavior of a conventional aircraft. Some years ago as an undergraduate student at the University of Iowa, I took a course in Descriptive Astronomy. The object took a familiar pattern, familiar to me, immediately after the sighting, I made some rough notes describing the sighting and direction that object moved.

Please send the form to my address indicated below:

I will be glad to answer any question to the best of my ability.

Sincerely,

[redacted]

Iowa City, Iowa
July 28, 1968
