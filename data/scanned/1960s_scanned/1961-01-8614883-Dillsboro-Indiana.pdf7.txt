Dear Sirs:

On Friday night, the 29th, around 10:30 p.m., a bright object was observed in the sky about 2 miles southwest of Dillsboro, Indiana. The object appeared to be stationary at first, then it moved rapidly, zigzagging back and forth across the sky until it was lost from view. The sighting lasted about 5 minutes. The object was observed by three witnesses, two adults and one child. It appeared to be a bright, white light, much brighter than a star. It did not have the appearance of an aircraft, and no sound was heard. The witnesses were quite positive in their report and seemed to be reliable persons. I thought you might be interested in this report.

Sincerely yours,
