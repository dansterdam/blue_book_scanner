Dear Sir:

On 7 August 1965 at 5:33 A.M. on this day while walking our dog, we observed an object in the sky which appeared to be in distress, since it was not maintaining a northerly course. We immediately called the station to report this incident.

Details are as follows:

Direction: The object was heading west at about 45 degrees from the north, but maintaining north course.

Length of time: 12:35 A.M. to 12:55 A.M.

Directly overhead (90 degrees) to disappearance in horizon to north.

Intensity: None brilliant than any star of the moon which was clearly visible at the time.

Size: About the size of a pea.

Altitude: Approximately 100 to 150 miles up.

Color: Remained a brilliant white without any surrounding color and no visible source.

Sound: None.

Visibility: Extremely clear night. Light thin clouds occasionally passed heavy enough to block vision or appear hazy. Seemed to descend and ascend at times.

Other objects: After call to Civil Defense, and again to SAFEGUARD indicating the appearance, we discussed this incident and had no sound was heard. The object did not appear to be a satellite or any known aircraft type may be in the area at the time.
