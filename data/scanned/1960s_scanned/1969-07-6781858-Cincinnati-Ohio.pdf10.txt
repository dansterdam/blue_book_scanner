The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a form with various check boxes and handwritten responses.

STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY? 
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR? 
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
FLASH OR FLICKER? 
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE? 
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
IS WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

The handwritten responses indicate that the object "suddenly speed up and run away" and that it would "Want to be kind to us".
