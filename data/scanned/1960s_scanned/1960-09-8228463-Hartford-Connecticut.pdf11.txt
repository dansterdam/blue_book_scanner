Sept. 4, 1960

The undersigned officer went to the rear porch of her home at 2:30 a.m., and noticed a round metallic object hovering about 150-200 ft. off the ground. It was about 30 ft. in diameter, and was emitting a bright light. It stopped suddenly, turned off the light, and came down very close to the ground. Immediately she saw a green flare about a foot high come down, and then it went back up into the object. The object then turned on a headlight and returned to the search. She observed it for 8 min. on the ground, the light went off, and it seemed to squash down to a thin line and disappear. The witness said the wind was slight and quiet, and there were no noise from the object.

At 1:00-a.m., a noise attracted her attention. She saw a search light of some unknown origin, which was shining various particles which showed up like sparks on the ground near the house. After a while, the particles were lifted, and the search light was extinguished. 

The witness believes that there was some kind of activity, but she is unable to explain what it was. She does not know what to make of the incident.

Officer Leonard Miller, Dist. 9 - 15, received "B" Sound.
