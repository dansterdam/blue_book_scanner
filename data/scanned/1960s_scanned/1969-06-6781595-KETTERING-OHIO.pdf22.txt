The image appears to contain two sketches or illustrations related to the reporting of a UFO sighting. The larger sketch on the top shows a compass-like diagram, likely representing the witness's perspective and the directions they saw the UFO move. The two smaller sketches on the bottom show views of the landscape, with a silhouetted figure visible in the center of each sketch.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "P" AT THE POSITION WHEN IT PASSED (DISAPPEARED). INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT'S PATH WITH STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG LINES, REFERRING TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS LANDING SKETCH.
