BRIGHTLY LIT OBJECT OBSERVED, NOTHING UNUSUAL

THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, WITH A LIGHT VISIBLE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DINNER PLATE AT ARM'S LENGTH. IT MOVED VERY SLOWLY AT ABOUT THE SPEED OF A SMALL AIRCRAFT AND WAS IN VIEW FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 TO 4 MINUTES. THERE WERE NO FLASHING LIGHTS, NAVIGATION LIGHTS, OR EXHAUST TRAILS VISIBLE. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE IN A LEVEL FLIGHT PATH AND EXHIBITED NO UNUSUAL MANEUVERS. ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, THIS WAS A REAL PHENOMENON AND WAS NOT PROPELLED BY ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT. NO PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE COULD BE OBTAINED AS THE WITNESS DID NOT HAVE A CAMERA AVAILABLE AT THE TIME.
