The text found in the document is as follows:

"It may be the case of a spins originating stars moving in the band of light.
It was then I realized that it was probably a satellite and that the band of light was more than daily 'rightly' of the man which had set an house or so earlier.
When the white light reached directly overhead, it disappeared. There were no clouds. The band of light was from 20 - 30 degrees arc in joint to the moon distance behind and moved through the sky with the white light. The 'gel' disappearing also at the overhead point.
The color at about the same time that I observed as echo satellite pass years ago in the Pacific.
I have had the years flying experience, both in jet and props."
