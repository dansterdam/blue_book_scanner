The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

CONCLUSIONS
Astronomical (meteor)

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer or blurred object travel to-ward the southeast at about ten minutes intervals. The object was blinking on and off but very fast. The objects flew in an eastern direction and disappeared from sight. There were just a few of them. All of them did not come in the same direction.

The description is consistent with that of an astronomical (meteor) observation.
