Slides of Price, City and or the area
One england slide shows the portion of the city taken from my front yard facing in the same direction as the slides of the object in the sky.
The object in the sky appeared above the trees in the center of the slide and about the size of a dime.
The other slide is one I took of the moon to see how it would compare in size and brightness with the other object.
The camera setting for the moon picture was the same as used for the other objects.
I am sending this as additional information for you.
