GENERAL CURTIS E. LE MAY
VICE CHIEF OF STAFF 
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON, D.C.

DEAR SIR:

RECENTLY, WHILE READING THE ENCLOSED NEWSPAPER ITEM, I WAS ONCE AGAIN IMPRESSED BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SUBJECT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO'S) IS BEING MADE A LAUGHING MATTER BY THE PRESS. AT THE TIME I WAS IN RAPID CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA, WORKING AS A LIEUTENANT IN THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE TIME OF GOING TO WORK THE DAY I SAW WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE A GENUINE UFO. HOWEVER, IN AN EFFORT TO FORGET THE EXPERIENCE, I HAVE NEVER REPORTED IT OFFICIALLY.

IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 5:30 A.M. I WAS WALKING FROM MY QUARTERS TO THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING WHEN I NOTICED AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHT HOVERING SILENTLY IN THE SKY APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING. IT WAS ROUND IN SHAPE AND HOVERED MOTIONLESS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. SUDDENLY, AT AN UNBELIEVABLE RATE OF SPEED, IT SHOT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. WHILE I WAS BEWILDERED BY THE SIGHT, I SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT TO ANYONE AND HAVE REMAINED SILENT SINCE THAT TIME. 

I AM ENCLOSING THE NEWSPAPER CLIPPING WHICH INDICATES THAT DESPITE THE SEEMING SERIOUSNESS OF THE MATTER, IT IS STILL BEING RIDICULED AND MADE A LAUGHING STOCK. I AM WONDERING IF THERE IS ANY WAY THIS MATTER CAN BE MADE TO RECEIVE THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION IT DESERVES.

VERY TRULY YOURS,
