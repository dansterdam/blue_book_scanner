The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten letter or document. I will proceed to extract the text from the document:

Dear sir:
The letter shown above is in regards to a sighting of an unidentified flying object. The object was seen moving across the sky and was estimated to be between 40-50 feet in diameter. The object was observed for approximately 15 seconds to 1-2 minutes, moving in a westerly direction at an estimated speed of 1,000 to 12,000 miles per hour. No sound was heard. The object had bluish-white lights around the perimeter and a reddish-orange light in the center. After reaching a certain distance, the object disappeared from view. The witness stated that this was the first time they had ever seen such an object and was quite concerned and interested in what it could have been.
