The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Extracted text from the document:

"HANG STRAIGHT UP AND AWAY
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODEDI
STEADY COLORI
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE STATERZ
SWOOP SUDDENLY
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEARI
ROLL LIKE ATOPi
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
IS WHAT THEY WERE YOUR ATTENTIONTO THE PHENOMENON?"

"NOTE: What they observed above
could not be categorized"

"How did it finally disappear?
Went straight away behind field observation"

"Did the phenomenon move behind or in front of something like a cloud, tree, or building at any time?"
