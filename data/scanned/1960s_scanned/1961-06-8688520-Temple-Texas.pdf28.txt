The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved horizon line with an object above it. The text asks the reader to imagine that they are at the point shown as "A" and to indicate how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when they first saw it.

The second sketch shows a wider landscape view with a person standing in the foreground. The text asks the reader to place the object at the position shown as "A" and to draw another sketch as an example of how to complete the information.
