Very bright, too bright to see surrounding, seemed to be gradually fading in and out. At times it seemed to be a very intense light, approximately 2 to 3 times the size of a star. It seemed to be stationary and remained in the sky for approximately 15 seconds. I seemed to move for 15 seconds over the direction of the field. However, it was not handled or in front of me.
