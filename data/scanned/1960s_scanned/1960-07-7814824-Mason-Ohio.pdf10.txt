The image does not contain a photograph, but rather two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon line, and instructions to imagine that the object was observed above the horizon. The second sketch contains two larger sketches, one showing a person on a road, and the other showing a person standing in a landscape.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
