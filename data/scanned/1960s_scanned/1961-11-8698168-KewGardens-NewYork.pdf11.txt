Dear Sir,
Nov. 26, 1961
I received a report on Nov. 25, 1961 at 11:20 p.m. from a resident of Kew Gardens, New York. He stated that on that date at approximately 11:10 p.m. he observed a bright light in the sky which moved rapidly for a few seconds, then remained stationary for about 2 minutes. The light then disappeared. The observer said the object was round and emitted a white light which was brighter than the surrounding stars. No sound was heard. The weather was clear with a few scattered clouds.
