Dear sir:

My name is [redacted]. I am 17 years old and as of Aug. 20, 1965 believe in UFOs and flying saucers. My brother [redacted] and I were in our backyard looking for meteorites from the predicted shower from the Perseus-Lyrid shower during the two hours we were outside from 8-10 PM. EDT.We saw six unidentified flying objects. The drawings enclosed are from 30-60% accurate and so is the one silhouette reading of the light formation both my brother and I know an airplane or jet when we see or hear one. We heard absolutely no sound from these UFOs. They went too fast for balloons and there is no place around here where huge weather balloons could be launched. I beg your pardon for the map included but I cannot mention the name of the town. In case you are wondering, I got the address of Project Blue Book from [redacted] book.
