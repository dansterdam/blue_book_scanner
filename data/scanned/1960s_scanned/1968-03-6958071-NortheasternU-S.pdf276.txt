Text from the document:

Dear Sirs - 
I am presently enrolled as a student at Bethany College, Bethany, West Virginia. At approximately 9:30 pm Sunday night, 3 March 1968, my roommate and I observed a curious sight in the western sky from our residence. 
We initially noticed two bright objects approaching from the west at high speed. As they appeared to be in pursuit of each other, one object seemed to be traveling at a higher or greater speed than the one pursued. The objects were observed intensely, and looked as if it was maneuvering and attempting to shoot the other one down. The four objects then passed behind some trees and the gymnasium, by which time they were receding and diminishing in distance.
I mention this to two fellow residents who were coming up the walk. If references or witnesses be needed.
