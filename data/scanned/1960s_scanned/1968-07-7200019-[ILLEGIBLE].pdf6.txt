Dear Sirs:

At 9:38 PM on 6 July 1968, a light was observed by two persons on the Atlantic Ocean about 15 miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. It appeared to be at about 40-45 degrees elevation and moved in an erratic pattern for several minutes before disappearing. The light was described as pulsing and changing colors from bright white to red to green. At times the light seemed to hover, at other times it moved rapidly in various directions.

This aerial phenomenon was witnessed by two reliable and responsible persons who are not given to imagining things. They are certain the light was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or any other known object. Both persons were very impressed and somewhat frightened by what they saw.

We would appreciate your evaluation of this incident and any information you might have on similar occurrences in this general area. We are most anxious to determine the nature of this sighting and would be grateful for any assistance you could provide.

Sincerely yours,
