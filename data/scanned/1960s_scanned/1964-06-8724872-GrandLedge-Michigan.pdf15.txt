On 13 June, 1964, at about 2215 hours, in Grand Ledge, Michigan, a group of people were having a party. During the party, Miss [redacted] was driving with Miss [redacted] beside her in the front seat. The car had just pulled out of the driveway and was about to head north towards Saginaw Highway, between Grand Ledge and Lansing. There was a very bright light coming from the front seat. The light came closer, and it was apparent that it was not a car, but a large glowing shape which filled the road from side to side. Miss [redacted] saw the object had a very white light for a few seconds, dimmed considerably, but almost immediately rose again to maximum brightness for several seconds. It then disappeared, without moving. While it was there, the girls could not see the road ahead, and could not determine if it was cars or cars passing by on Saginaw Road through the small opening. Investigators visited the scene with the girls and Miss [redacted] parents. The girls showed where several of the boys from the party had looked for the object, but they had not seen anything. The place where the car was stopped, the headlights on Joy Road (as seen on the road about 100 feet in front of the car) gave a clear indication of where the object had been seen.
