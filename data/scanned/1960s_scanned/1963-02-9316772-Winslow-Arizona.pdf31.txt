Record Breaking Cloud Formation Over Southwest
At sunset on February 28, 1963, an extraordinary, ring-shaped cloud was observed over Arizona, New Mexico and California. It was seen as far south as Winslow, Arizona, Albuquerque in the north, and Los Angeles in the west. It stretched over approximately 500 miles.
Studies conducted by University of Arizona Atmospheric Physics Lab Chief Dr. James E. McDonald showed its height to be approximately 35,000 feet with a diameter of 15 kilometers, considerably higher than the normal cloud layers.
It became apparent that the odd phenomenon was luminous and not just reflecting the sun. The upper sections of the cloud were composed of water droplets or ice crystals at 42 kilometers, considerably higher than the diffused corona. The shimmering effect or "mother-of-pearl" are usually observed only at altitudes of 100,000 feet, being shapeless and formed by air moving up over mountain ranges in a region of severe cold.
According to Dr. McDonald's conversation with Dr. MacDonald, Mrs. Lorensen was informed that the high-flying vehicle might account for the formation but to date the origin of the cloud has not been determined. It has been speculated that it could be the result of an undisclosed experiment or of extraterrestrial origin.
