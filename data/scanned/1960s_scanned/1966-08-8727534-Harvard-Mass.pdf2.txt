I have had type of aircraft and the possibility of seeing unidentified objects floating through the sky. I don't recall having a specific incident to report, however. The behavior has normally been like a very small bright light, not like a large object maneuvering but rather what appears to be a star-like point of light that may blink out or move erratically for a brief time and then disappear. I haven't observed anything that I would consider to be a very unusual sighting, but I do occasionally notice things in the sky that catch my attention, though they are usually over very quickly and I am not able to get a good look at them. I just wanted to mention this as background information.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
