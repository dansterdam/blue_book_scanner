SOVIET REJECTS OFFER OF PIECE OF SPUTNIK

UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Sept. 6 - The Soviet Union has rejected the United Nations' offer to have a piece of the Soviet Sputnik IV satellite,
which fell to earth last week, placed in the U.N.'s memorabilia collection. The Soviet delegate told the U.N. that "while the offer was appreciated, the
Soviet Union feels that the satellite should remain where it landed as a symbol of the Soviet achievement in the exploration of outer space." The United
Nations had asked the Soviet Union to let it have a piece of the satellite for display. The spokesman said that the Russian delegate, Valerian Zorin,
stated that the Soviet Union could not comply with the request, as the pieces now were part of the Soviet patrimony.
