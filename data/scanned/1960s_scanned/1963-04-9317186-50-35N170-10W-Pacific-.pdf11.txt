Lights At Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin
During the lock preceding 19 April 1963, strange lights were seen maneuvering in the skies above Fond Du Lac. On Thursday night, bright lights at diverse trajectories were sighted at about 8:20 to 8:30 p.m. CST.
These lights, brighter than any stars in color, moved rapidly and now and then in a direction from horizon to horizon. The direction of travel was mostly east to west. It was also noted that they made sharp turns.
An official fisherman for the Federal Aviation Agency in Milwaukee stated that the agency could find no explanation for the sightings. He indicated that the office had received similar reports a week earlier and had determined that the objects were airplanes, and most likely bombers which renewed operations over Vietnam on 1 April. But this case sounds like another "possible" identification.
