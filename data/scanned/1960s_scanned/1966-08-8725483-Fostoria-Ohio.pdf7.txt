The image does not contain a photograph. It is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a handwritten letter.

Dear Sir, 

Today I received a letter from NICAP stating that you did not receive a negative on the UFO photo I took. I am sorry that it was not received - Perhaps it was left in the bottom of the envelope where you could not see it. If you will check again, I will be glad to have the negative back. Of course, I will try and have another negative made from one of the prints.
