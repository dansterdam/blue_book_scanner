Carrying out OCR on the text in the document:

Suddenly it is noted that apparently at first the object was reasonably slow in its movements, then suddenly appeared to accelerate rapidly and move off at high speed. The object is described as being larger than a star, approximately the size of a quarter at arm's length, and elliptical in shape. It was observed to change direction abruptly, making very fast turns. The observer felt that the object was under intelligent control.
