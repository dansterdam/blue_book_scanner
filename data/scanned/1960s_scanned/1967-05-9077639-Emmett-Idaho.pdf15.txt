UFO Investigation

UFO (CTIC-UFO) 
Headquarters Air Force Base, Ohio 45433

1. On 12 and 13 July 1957, Major Quintanilla of your office called this office and requested we investigate an alleged UFO sighting which had been brought to the attention of a U.S. Senator by a letter from Mr. L.C. Gumm. 

2. On 13 July we called Mr. Gumm and obtained his version of the incident. The boy, 15 years old, was acquainted with the fact that on 25 May 1957 they had seen what looked like a bright light which was maneuver in a strange manner in the sky. The boy also stated that he had photographed 1) twice with a borrowed camera, a Polaroid Swinger. Mr. Gumm and a newspaper photographer came to his house but they could not find the exact place where they had witnessed the sight.

3. Mr. Gumm agreed to arrange for us to interview the boy and to visit the location where the sighting occurred on 17 July. But on 14 July he called to say that the photograph that they had showed had been given them by the boy who said had found it somewhere. Therefore we cancelled preparations to go to Emmett.

4. The investigation was viewed as having supplied the photograph as evidence of a UFO sighting. This report as a UFO sighting, with photograph, was forwarded to your office on 16 July. It is probable that it should be considered in evaluation of the earlier cases which have similar photographs in the present case this was not the case submitted in March, but we expect to determine this.

5. We have asked Mr. Gumm to obtain a copy of the newspaper article for us. We also suggesting that he write again to the Senator that the report of a UFO sighting was false.

WILLIAM G. BAXTER, Maj. USAF
