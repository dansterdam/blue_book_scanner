The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned page from a document. The text on the page appears to be a form or questionnaire related to the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

The text from the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object or objects you observed.

Continued: Triangular-shaped of a bluish-white color, with the left side tinged with red. The middle filled with greenish-brown streaks and clouds of vapor. The right side with pulsating blue-white intensity. The whole formation moved up and down, to and fro, in a rather erratic manner, with abrupt stops and sudden changes of direction. Both vertical and horizontal movement. About 10-15 seconds duration.
