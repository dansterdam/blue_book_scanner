UFO Observation - 8 Jun 1969

Dear Mrs. Robbins:

We feel that your UFO observation of 8 June 1969 was of the planet Mars. At 5:15 a.m. EDT, Mars was at an angular elevation of 20 degrees. At an azimuth of 265 degrees and was on the horizon. GA 8 June 1969, Mars had a stellar magnitude of -1.4 and as such was brighter than all of the lesser objects except Jupiter.

Sincerely,
