The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

Several children have also seen a Long-white object in their neighborhood. It seemed to hover over a house, then moved slowly in a curving motion until it disappeared. They reported a round stop & then move very rapidly. I believe they have seen this on March 16 or 15th about 10:00 pm. They all saw it at once & some remained after others had returned home. Even a police officer saw it later on & I think they missed attention whether on March 15 or 16. They seemed convinced & already had halt plenty of attention when we were discussing their functions U.F.O sightings for the first time.
