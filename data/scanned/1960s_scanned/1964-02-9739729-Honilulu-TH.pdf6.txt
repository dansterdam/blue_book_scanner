COULD BE SPACE VEHICLE OR THE SOUND IS LIKE A SOUND COMING FROM A SPACE VEHICLE OVERHEAD
As I stated over head, or the sound from a space object that is seen overhead.
Cornpassmn, after hearing this sound that was described for quite a while, and then a lull in the sound, it suddenly resumed. The sound was described as being somewhat bizarre, but the military service was notified and indicated that this incident was in the order of routine, and there wasn't anything to it that was to be alarmed about. However, I do too ascertain that the person who had heard this unusual sound was quite disturbed by it and he too had heard that strange sound. As you told them the sound, they all seem to recognize that, and spoke to the unusual and undescribable noise.
This sound, gave them the impression as if this object was wanting to land or performance manner. However, is none.
INVESTIGATION: For more witnesses to this case, please advise the Commanding
Officer, _______________ Air Base, to interview any other members of the
household who may have heard or seen this object. If any other witnesses can
be located, such as neighbors, please request that they also be interviewed
regarding this incident and describe in detail the sound of this object.
It is requested that any additional information or data be furnished this
office as soon as possible.
