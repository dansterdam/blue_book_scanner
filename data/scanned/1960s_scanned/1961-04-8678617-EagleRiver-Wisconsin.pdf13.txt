SUMMARY
At 1130, 25 April 1961 Major Friend received telephone call from Captain Williamson, Duluth Air Defense Sector. Captain Williamson's call was to report an incident concerning an alleged flying saucer landing in Eagle River, Wisconsin on 18 April 1961. Mr. [redacted] of Eagle River told Judge [redacted], District Attorney, that a flying saucer had landed on his property on 18 April 1961. Three persons dressed in two-piece black suits, 5 feet tall, and weighing approximately 125 pounds had disembarked from the space craft through a hatch door and proceeded to the water and was rewarded with 3 cakes. The cakes were 2" by 3 1/2" flat, and perforated with holes the size of a pencil (cross-section). The ship that unexpectedly landed before them was described as being 15' thick and 30' in diameter. Exhaust pipes 6 or 7" in diameter protruded from this craft.

Major Friend made telephone contact with Judge [redacted]. The Judge, who has handled a good number of mental cases (psychiatric information), indicated that he believes Mr. [redacted]'s story. The Judge stated that the cakes were still fresh one week after the incident. Two of the cakes are still in the possession of Mr. [redacted]. One cake was forwarded to Major Donald E. Keyhoe by Judge [redacted].
