The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch or diagram. It contains several elements:

1. A man with an arrow pointing to him and the text "Mr. Fei points out object".
2. Another arrow pointing to a structure labeled "BRIDGE".
3. A map-like symbol in the bottom right corner.
4. Some additional annotations and symbols, including a note that says "I see a man and I think him what he thinks it is."

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

Mr. Fei points out object
I see a man and I think him what he thinks it is.
