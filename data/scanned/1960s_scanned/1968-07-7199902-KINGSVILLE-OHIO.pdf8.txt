The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch or diagram. The sketch appears to show several disc-shaped or oval-shaped objects that are labeled "JUST FLIGHT". The text below the sketch says "RUPERT DUTERCY".

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

RUPERT DUTERCY
JUST FLIGHT
