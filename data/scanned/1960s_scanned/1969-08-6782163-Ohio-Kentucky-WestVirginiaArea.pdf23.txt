The text beneath this checklist states:
"The object was sighted like a moon on any day."

Below that, the text states:
"Disappeared into space."

The final section asks: "DID THE PHENOMENOM MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?" and indicates "YES" with a handwritten note that states "DISAPPEARED INTO SPACE".
