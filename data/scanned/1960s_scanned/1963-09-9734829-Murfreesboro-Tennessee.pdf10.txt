Dear â€”,

This office is in receipt of the item you recently forwarded us. We are unable to identify any special significance in this matter and are enclosing it for your continued information. The Air Force still believes that this was only an aerial phenomenon and was not any manufactured object of foreign or domestic origin. Some ballistic data seems to indicate there could be a significant amount of time lapse during the initial phase of the observation, and the location indicated is approximately 75 degrees above the horizon.

Sincerely,

CHARLES T. VAN VLIET
