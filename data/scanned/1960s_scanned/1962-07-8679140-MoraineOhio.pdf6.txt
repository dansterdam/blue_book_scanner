This page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a questionnaire or observation report form with instructions and questions for the observer.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time the object was sighted, how much of the match would have been covered?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. If the object gave off light, can you describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw?
