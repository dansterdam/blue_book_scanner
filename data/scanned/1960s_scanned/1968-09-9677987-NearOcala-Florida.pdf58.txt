There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

mile from the aircraft--and Miami Center requested them to visually look in
the area where the aircraft was to see if they could see any lights or any
UFO or anything possible in altitude of around 5000 to 15000 feet; just
take a normal look up there and see if they could see anything, and I
imagine there were three to seven aircraft they requested to look out there
and none of them saw anything.

Now what does that really mean, I wonder, Here we had a radar return
and we had a visual sighting, and yet they were the only ones who made the
visual sighting.

It seems that if this thing was still in there view, that someone else
could not
see it. Now, we were never able to confirm the time or anything;
they didn't keep an accurate time of when it was harrassing them, or when it
disappeared, when it wasn't observed, or anything like that, so we don't
really know if these aircraft that were requested to look in that area would
have seen anything.

Now, the night was clear?

Yes sir. It was a very good night. There were a few lightening flashes,
I think, out to the southeast of them, over the central part of Florida.
This was the only thing that would have been interfered.

Now, the transcript of the tape--that was much earlier then. That
refers to the first sighting between Tyndall and Cross City, and that was,
waid you say, about half an hour before the radar incident?
