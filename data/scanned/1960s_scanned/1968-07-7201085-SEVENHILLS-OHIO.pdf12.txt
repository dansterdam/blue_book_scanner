The image contains two sketches or illustrations rather than actual photographs. The top illustration appears to be a compass or navigation diagram with various directions and labels. The bottom illustrations show two different landscape views, one with a person standing in the foreground and the other showing a distant horizon.

THE WITNESS STATED THAT HE COULD NOT ACTUALLY SEE ANY DEFINITE OBJECT, ONLY THE PATTERN OF FLASHING LIGHTS. ALTHOUGH THIS RECORD IS INCOMPLETE, IT DOES PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION ON THE NATURE OF THE REPORT.
