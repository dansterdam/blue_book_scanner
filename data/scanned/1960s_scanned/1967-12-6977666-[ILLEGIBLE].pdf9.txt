The image appears to contain a hand-drawn diagram with annotations. The diagram shows a flying object or UFO seen through a telescope, with labels indicating "where first saw", "church steeple", and "fire escape". There is also a sketch of a town and other elements in the diagram.

As an OCR system, the text I can extract from this document is:

"as seen through a Telescope
