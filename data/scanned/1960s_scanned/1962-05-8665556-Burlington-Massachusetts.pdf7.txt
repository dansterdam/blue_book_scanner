The Burlington, Massachusetts incident (May 8, 1962)
On May 8, 1962, several witnesses in Burlington, Massachusetts reported seeing an unidentified flying object. The object was described as silver in color, elliptical in shape, and approximately 50-60 feet in diameter. It was observed hovering over a wooded area for several minutes before rapidly accelerating and disappearing from view.

The incident was investigated by the U.S. Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, the official government program for studying UFO reports. The investigation concluded that the sighting was likely caused by the misidentification of a conventional aircraft or weather phenomenon, but the exact nature of the object was never definitively determined.
