UFO SIGHTING

Received a call from the Command Post Duty Officer, Major J. E. Edwards, Warner-Robbins AFB, Ga. who passed on information to us relating to an UFO sighting. This was third party information since it was passed to him by the Officer of the Day who actually interviewed the individuals reporting the sighting.

Mr. ________ observed the object and was corroborated by Mr. ________ who also observed the object. Observation was made at approximately 2315 EST 5 Aug 60 at Sandersville, Ga. which is 3 miles from Tennille. Object was estimated at 1000 feet altitude and observed for a period of 30 to 3 minutes. Appeared as very bright object while it was a point of "Geat" intensity preceding on a north to south course. Course was non-erratic and appeared erratic. Definitely not a star or an aircraft of the observation of the object was intensive, however, had no definite shape.  

The Officer of the Day, Captain Mattern questioned the observers resulting in the above information and can be reached Warner-Robbins, Ga. Attempted to get additional information from Major Edwards, ie. whether the observation was made while in a vehicle, or could not occur any more since he was not directly involved. Didn't think it was proper or result in much more information by calling Warner-Robbins and talking to Captain since he was not directly involved, nor the individuals concerned.
