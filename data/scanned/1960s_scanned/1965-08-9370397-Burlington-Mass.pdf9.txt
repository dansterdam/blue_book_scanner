Dear Mr. Rea,

Thank you very much for the information. I was very interested in the subject itself and wonder if you might possibly help me with any other information you may have. My mother helped me to get the information for the report that I needed and I was wondering if I could use this information for it or if you have any other suggestions.

Sincerely,
