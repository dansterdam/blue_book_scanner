The image does not contain a photograph. It shows a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon. The sketch depicts an elongated, cigar-shaped object with what resembles "wings" or protrusions on the sides, and an indication of "exhaust or vapor trails" by an arrow. The text below the sketch asks the viewer to draw a picture that will show the shape of the phenomenon and include any details that might have appeared as wings or protrusions, and indicate exhaust or vapor trails using an arrow.
