There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document, which appears to be a questionnaire or interview form with various questions about the sighting of an unidentified object.

Here is the text output from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
NO

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): YES NO (Don't Know) If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): YES NO (Don't Know) If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: 
a. Sound HEARD IT, BUT NO NOISE, BESIDES MY RADIO WAS GOING. 
b. Color YELLOWISH-WHITE, BRIGHTER THAN ANY STAR IN THE SKY.

18. We wish to know the angular size: Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, what would have been covered by the match head? 10 degrees TO 15 degrees IN DIAMETER AND ABOUT 2 BLADES OF GRASS ON THE GROUND.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow outside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
NO SKETCH, JUST A BRIGHT LIGHT.
