There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a declassified Project Blue Book report, likely documenting a UFO sighting.

Subj: U.F.O. sighting of
At 0111Z Sept 1964, position 16-39 N, 139-59 E, while on Heading 120 degrees Magnetic, I was sitting in the Right Hand Pilot's seat looking in the direction of 210 degrees Magnetic observing stars with the navigator when I saw what appeared at first to be a very bright Meteor traveling in a direction from North West to South East, descending in altitude. It began to slow up and eventually came to a complete stop at a very bright bluish white light and had a pulsating red-colored tail which looked very similar to the Exhaust tail of a Jet in Afterburner. Slightly after reentry altitude, an object fell away, and although still traveling in a forward direction, fell almost straight down and burned with a green light. It fell slowly, although much faster than if it had had a parachute attached. The main object seemed to burn out at 5 or 10 degrees above the horizon.
