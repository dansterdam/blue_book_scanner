JUNE

The report of the described objects and sighting of same was received from USAF Hyattsville, Md on 8 June 1962. The persons who reported the sighting were Mrs. [REDACTED], her daughter, and a visiting friend. The sighting occurred on 6 June 1962 at approximately 9:45 PM EST while the observers were in the backyard of Mrs. [REDACTED]'s home. 

The observers stated that they observed 3 objects hovering over their backyard, first one object, then a second and third. The objects were described as oval-shaped, about the size of a house window, and to be giving off a dull glow. The objects were approximately 150-200 feet in altitude and moved slowly, apparently silently, and changed course and position in a seemingly erratic manner. The objects were observed for a period of 5-10 minutes before disappearing. There were no other witnesses in the immediate area.

The observers stated that they were very familiar with aircraft and could readily distinguish between ordinary aircraft and the objects observed. They stated definitely that the objects were not aircraft, helicopters, or any other known type of aerial vehicle. They could provide no explanation for what they observed.
 
I do not consider it to have been a dangerous or alarming incident. There were no threats or unusual actions on the part of the objects, and no physical effects on the observers. The report appears to be a straightforward account of an unexplained aerial sighting.
