There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document dated June 27, 1968, which is a letter responding to a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

The text in the document is as follows:

JUN 27 1968

Dear Mr. -----,

This will reply to your letter of June 23, 1968, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation to what you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator who is better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting yourself by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the Project Blue Book report we sent you on June 20, 1968.

Sincerely,

JAMES E. ATOMAR
