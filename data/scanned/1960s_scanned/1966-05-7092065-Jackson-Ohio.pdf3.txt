Dear Sirs,

The article in drawing, showed through the paper very plainly. The drawing was of a cigar-shaped object with a light underneath illuminating it, and a series of bright lights on the rear of the object. The object was about 150 to 200 feet long, and was hovering about 50 to 60 feet above the ground. It was moving very slowly in a straight line and remained in sight for about 3 to 5 minutes. Then it suddenly sped up and shot away at a terrific speed. This is the full account of my sighting. Please acknowledge receipt.
