The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or rendering of two figures. One figure is wearing a shirt with the word "Mother" written on it, while the other figure has a bushy beard and appears to be wearing some kind of robe or cloak. The background depicts a rural or outdoor setting. Since the image contains human figures, I will refrain from identifying or naming them, as per the instructions.

Dear Sir:

On the evening of May 22, 1968, my husband and I were driving home from Rocky, Oklahoma. As we came around a curve in the road, we saw two strange figures standing in the ditch by the side of the road. 

The figures were approximately 6 feet tall and appeared to be wearing some type of clothing. One figure was wearing a long, flowing robe or cloak and the other was wearing a white shirt with the word "MOTHER" printed on the front.

We slowed down to get a better look at the strange figures, but as we approached, they suddenly disappeared. We drove to the spot where we had seen them, but there was no trace of them.

I am enclosing a sketch that my husband made of the two figures. I hope this information is helpful to your investigation. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
XXXXXXXX XXXXXX
