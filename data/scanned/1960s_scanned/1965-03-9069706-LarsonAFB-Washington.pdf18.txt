VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - The Air Force launched a new satellite here Monday at 5:43 a.m. PST. The one-line Air Force satellite, carrying a scientific experiment, was boosted into an orbit of more than 17,000 miles by a Thor-Agena rocket combination from this Pacific Missile Range.

The Thor-Agena project was developed as a flexible satellite launching system capable of placing payloads of more than 500 pounds in orbit. The satellite launched Monday weighs less than 75 pounds.
