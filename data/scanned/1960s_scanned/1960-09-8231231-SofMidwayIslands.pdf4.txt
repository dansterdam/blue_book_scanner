AFOIN - D332 and ATIC MSG APGIN-D330Z
ATIC CONCLUSION THAT THE OBJ WITNESSED BY THE CREW OF A MILITARY
AIRCRAFT AT 0700Z ON 26 SEP 60, WAS PROBABLY ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION
OF THE STAR ARCTURUS. THE AIRCRAFT WAS AT POSITION 21-52N, 179-22W.
REFRACTION IS THE BENDING OF LIGHT AS IT ENTERS OR LEAVES A DENSER
OR LESS DENSE MEDIUM. IMAGES (LIGHT) SEEN UNDER THESE CONDITIONS
WILL SEEM TO TWINKLE, CHANGE BOTH COLOR AND INTENSITY, CHANGE SHAPE
AND SIZE, AS WELL AS TO DANCE AROUND AND APPEAR TO RUSH TOWARD AND
AWAY FROM THE OBSERVER. A SECONDARY EFFECT IS THAT OF DISPERSION,
LIGHT OF DIFFERENT WAVE LENGTHS (COLOR) BEND AT DIFFERENT ANGLES,
THEREFORE THE OBJ JETS ALL APPEAR MULTI-COLORED. WHEN THE SUN,
MOON OR STARS ARE LOW ON THE HORIZON THE LIGHT RAYS ARE BENT BY THE
ATMOSPHERE INTO A CURVED PATH WHICH RENDERS THESE OBJECTS VISIBLE
