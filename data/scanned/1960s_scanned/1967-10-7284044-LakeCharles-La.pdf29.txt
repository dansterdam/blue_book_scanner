There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a form with questions about an unidentified object that was observed.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One)
Yes No Don't Know

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound 
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. Much of the object is covered by the end of the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any of the other questions you can answer such as motion, position, etc. and especially indicate from the drawing if the object was moving.
