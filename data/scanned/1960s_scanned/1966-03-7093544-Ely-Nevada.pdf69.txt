The document text:

The object I seen was clearly visible in the evening hazy. The fact that close attention was apparently paid to observing this object would seem to indicate that whatever it was has received close scrutiny and careful observation, and any wrong impressions would be pretty well eliminated. This first of all appears as I remember very clearly and vividly as a point of light, as I recall, moving at a moderate rate of speed, and as it approached and came closer it became a luminous oval or disc shaped object. At its closest approach, which was probably several miles away, it seemed to me to be about the same size or a little smaller than the full moon. Of the actual shape of the object I am not certain, as it appeared to me to be somewhat elongated or oval like, but I am quite certain that it was definitely not spherical. As it approached and receded it appeared to me to maintain a relatively constant brightness, except perhaps when it momentarily disappeared behind the distant mountains. In any event, it is my firm impression that this was not any usual aerial phenomena that I have ever observed before, as its appearance, brightness, and the apparent way in which it moved set it apart from anything I have previously seen.
