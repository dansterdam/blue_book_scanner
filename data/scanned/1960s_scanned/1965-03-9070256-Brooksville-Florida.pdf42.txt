Floridian Says 'Outer Space' Creature Took His Picture

BROOKSVILLE, Fla. (UPI) - A 60-year-old man claims a "Wright-Patterson Air Force Base creature" took his picture last Thursday while walking in a wooded area near his home.

John F. Reeves who said he "stared back at his glass viewer" said the creature was 6-7 feet tall, stocky, and wearing a gray garment-like suit with a shiny "glass-like" head appeared to have dark tan flesh. Reeves said the creature then floated across his phenomena in the trees "without a sound".

He said the creature was about 30 feet high and was squatting in the trees at the time. Reeves said when he attempted to take a picture of the creature, it disappeared, and he found two pieces of cloth-like material on the ground where it had stood. He retrieved them and said they had very queer writing on them.

The Air Force said "it couldn't even blink an eye" to his description of the craft which investigates unidentified flying objects.

Then, he said, the creature
walked up and stood still a few
seconds. "I froze," he said.
"The thing was like a robot,
and I looked it right in the
face. The object flashed a
light at me and I blacked
out."
The creature then walked
off, Reeves said, and he re-
covered to find the two pieces
of the material the thing had
dropped. Reeves said they
appeared to have some kind of
very queer writing on them.
