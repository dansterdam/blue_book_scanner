Mystery Blamed On Reflections
PATRICK AIR FORCE BASE -- The Air Force said Tuesday night that reflections caused by an unusual weather phenomenon over the City of Cocoa Beach Monday night and early Tuesday were responsible for reports of strange lights in the sky.
Lt. Col. Patrick D. McCaslin of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations said the reflections created the appearance of objects in the sky that moved rapidly and appeared to change position several times.
