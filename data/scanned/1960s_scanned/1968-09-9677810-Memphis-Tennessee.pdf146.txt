SURFACE AND UPPER-AIR TEMPERATURES 
SEPTEMBER 9, 1968 
WEST GULF, MEMPHIS, TN
GENERAL SUMMARY

A low pressure system centered over Missouri is producing cloudy, rainy weather over the central and eastern states. A weak high pressure system is building over the extreme northeastern states.

Surface temperatures are in the 50s and 60s over the northern states and 70s and 80s over the southern states. Upper air temperatures are in the 40s at 850 mb and 30s at 700 mb over the northern states and 50s at 850 mb and 40s at 700 mb over the southern states.

Surface and upper air analyses indicate the low pressure system over Missouri will weaken tonight as it moves eastward. Drier and cooler air will move into the eastern states tomorrow as the high pressure system builds. Skies should clear and temperatures moderate across the eastern half of the country on Tuesday.
