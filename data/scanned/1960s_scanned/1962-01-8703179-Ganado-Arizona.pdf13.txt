The image contains a sketch or drawing of an object that appears to resemble a flying saucer or UFO. The drawing is hand-drawn and crude, with a circular shape and what seems to be a domed or rounded top. There is no other photograph present in this image.

Text transcribed from the document:

"At the telescope the object appeared to be a very large and down and make many other sort of a figure."
