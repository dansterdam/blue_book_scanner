There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing a sketch and text.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the sketch to show the high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the sketch to show the compass direction in which you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

"THE OBJECT STARTED OUT UNIFORM, STEADY AND BRIGHT, THEN APPEARED TO BREAK UP INTO A FAN SHAPED CLUSTER OF SMALLER OBJECTS THAT ALSO STREAKED ACROSS THE SKY AS THEY MOVED."

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
