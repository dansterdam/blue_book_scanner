The shared image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains no photograph, but rather a diagram and several questions related to sighting UFOs.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curve where the object was above the horizon (sky-line), and place an "O" on the curve where the object was below the horizon (sky-line) when you first saw the object. Place an "A" on the curve where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the point "A" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
