Meteorologist Claims UFOs Just Reflections
DALLAS, TEX. (AP) - A Dallas meteorologist claims the mysterious objects seen in the sky are just reflections of bright objects in the atmosphere, the U.S. Weather Bureau said Monday.
Dallas meteorologist Ray Wood said he believes the flying objects reported to authorities and the Air Force as "unidentified flying objects" - UFOs - are merely reflections of bright stars, planets or other objects high in the atmosphere which are lighted by the sun and reflect its rays.
His theory is that the UFO's are the reflection of two objects moving between two celestial layers, with the UFO effect being caused by the refraction of light between the two layers.
The U.S. Weather Bureau said it found no unusual atmospheric conditions that would cause such reflections. However, it said that Wood's theory could account for some UFO reports.
