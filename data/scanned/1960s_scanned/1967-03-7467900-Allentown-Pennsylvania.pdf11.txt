Proposed reply to letter from (redacted) dated 26 Mar 67

Dear Mr. (redacted),

Reference your recent letter in which you requested the evaluation on your March 26, 1967 sighting which you reported to the Air Force.

You described the object as being brighter than a star, bright, fire engine red all over. This plus the fact that you only observed the object for approximately two seconds indicates that you probably observed a meteor. Your report is being carried in Air Force files as a meteor observation.
