Text from the document:

I WAS COMING HOME FROM WORK ABOUT 10:15 P.M. IN MY CAR WHEN I SAW SOMETHING IN THE SKY THAT LOOKED LIKE A PINK LIGHT OR GLOW. IT WAS JUST AHEAD OF MY CAR AND I CONTINUED TO WATCH IT AS I DROVE. IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING SLOWLY, JUST IN FRONT OF ME, AND TO MY RIGHT. IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL, AND WAS PINK IN COLOR. IT CONTINUED THIS WAY FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES, THEN SUDDENLY SHOT UP INTO THE SKY AT HIGH SPEED AND DISAPPEARED. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A PLANE, BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND AND IT MOVED UNLIKE ANY PLANE I'VE EVER SEEN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN, BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT ANYTHING NORMAL. I SAW THIS SAME PINK LIGHT AGAIN 2 NIGHTS LATER IN THE SAME AREA, BEHAVING IN THE SAME MANNER. I AM AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN WHAT I SAW, AS I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. I'D BE CURIOUS TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE IN THE AREA SAW ANYTHING SIMILAR.
