A UFO? Oct.15, 1966
Yes Sir, says Ronald

Have the UFO's invaded
Rowan County? 
Ronald Peeler, 13-year-old
eighth grade at Faith School,
said they have.

He went out to check on his cows
near his home on Faith Church Road,
he said, and "a pleasure turned
to fear." The object "came down through the trees"
and chased him, he says.

Ronald called The Post Saturday night to report his discovery, but was still too excited to
tell his father, Dwight Peeler.
Ronald made a sketch of the object, 
which Peeler said his son was
"scared to go outside once he
reached home."

Ronald said he was driving his
tractor home from work on the
Church Road shortly before 6:30
p.m., when he saw the object
hovering over the trees.

He said it went from the sky
into some trees, and when Peeler
became excited the object
looked as if it was chasing
him.
The last he saw of it, how-
ever, was when it threw Peeler
around and rounded a curve in the road.

Ronald said the object was
as large as a low-flying plane, 
and had a red light on one
end and a green light on the
other.

There were no other reports
of the incident.
