UFO form continued

Charlie Mr. Hadley related the U.F.O. sighting near the U. S. building, a town with a newspaper, also a second sighting that evening, this was around 8:30 PM. He viewed the object clearly, it was about 25-30 feet in diameter, round, hovering or standing still, and had no lights. It made no noise as far as he could tell. He was alome at the time. 
This sighting lasted 5-10 minutes.
There of course would be a number of people around a newspaper building but none are known to have seen this object. I think about it and can't understand how come of the employees or residents around would not have been put on this trail. 
One man more careful would have been handy, probably would have produced a valuable instrument. Some good photographs would have been highly desirable, this seems an excellent opportunity lost.
Thanking you for recording this again, I remain
