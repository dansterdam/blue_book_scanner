Odder son-moved what looked to be a backwash or light of moon. It gave a half-inch space and a very dim glow with no outline visible but it was very wierd and no sound. After about 3 or 4 minutes it moved off to the NW and got much brighter and bigger very rapidly and disappeared into the distance. The red glow we saw from about 3:50 to 4:00 am is what is amazing we can't think of what caused that and the fact it moved so rapidly when it left. We saw it through three trees and could tell the direction it was moving, it was not a lighthouse or anything we can identify. When I was watching the object I was facing due north. The red glow suddenly appeared and we watched it for 10-12 minutes it was a very accurate account. I don't think you can explain any strange phenomenon like this away as 1st thought when I need, all of a sudden it appeared again and again what it might some rain. Some people aren't very cooperative when you ask their opinion. I still a court of about 5 or 6 minutes to realize last the what I had seen I'm sure.
