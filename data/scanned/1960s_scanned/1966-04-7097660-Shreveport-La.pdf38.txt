Transcribed text from the document:

Shortly after, they were sitting near fire and looking up through the chimney, when she saw a figure above them. Shortly after she said they saw a huge figure of a man (presumable) about 7 ft tall and with a tight feltly black garment, like a trench coat - - but she could not see the form.

When they turned they were accused of the horseplay on the roof but protested complete innocence. Furthermore, neither of the two wore as tall nor dressed like the figure -- which had now been seen three times.

As they were going to the car, he felt the presence and she stood up on his neck. As they approached the car, walking toward the vest, they noticed two circular lights (blue and red) with white lights in the center. The white lights were going on and off at an equal rate.

After three or four minutes, during which time they found nothing, they went back on the road on the opposite side, out of sight of the "object". After three or four minutes, they went to see if the "object" was coming closer, but whatever it was gone or invisible - there were no lights or sound. At night in Daniels' Park it is possible to see lights for a great distance. At night the leads assumed the lights of the "car" (they looked something like car lights being turned on and off) were on a level meadow just off the road. When they returned in daylight they noted that the lights had appeared over a very uneven gulley, where no car could be expected to be.

There- and return, and their statement that they had not been responsible for the contrary noises, near panic set in. Up to this time the conclusion was that some hoodlums were about and that some harm might come to the girls or to all of them.
