35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

On Feb 7, 1967 I saw a metallic disc-shaped object which appeared to be about 50 ft in diameter. It was hovering about 70 ft above the ground at the edge of a forest near my home in Easthampton, New York. The object was brilliant white in color and seemed to be shimmering or vibrating. It made no sound and did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion. I watched it for about 2 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. I was very close to the object and was able to observe it clearly. It was definitely not a conventional aircraft or any known type of aircraft that I am familiar with. I am quite convinced that what I saw was a genuine unidentified flying object. I would be happy to answer any other questions you may have about my sighting.
