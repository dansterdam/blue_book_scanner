Feb 26, 1965

Irvington, N.Y. 10522

Dear Sir,

Last night (Feb 25) I saw a UFO for over 1 1/2 hours in the western skies about 9:00 P.M. 

When I first saw it, it appeared star-like, but it soon developed into a star-shaped object and it was yellow with
lighted and it moved rapidly. The size of the 1 on the right side was diminutive compared to the size of the object which
was going out of sight at much lower than a star-like vehicle and flew north toward the western skies. It went
beyond my sight and I lost sight of it about 5 minutes before 11 P.M. I phoned various individuals in Irvington, N.Y. at the time. I phoned a police because of its strange flight characteristics. It did not stop and hovered at any time. There were no sounds from the object which was going across the western sky and
of the western part. The police said he could see the lights and said this thing was going the western
sky. As I said, this thing I saw was for over 1 1/2 hours strange object. Please let me know if anything like this
has been observed anywhere. I look forward to your reply. Thank you for your attention. I was very impressed with
the first impression of the object. I saw it.
