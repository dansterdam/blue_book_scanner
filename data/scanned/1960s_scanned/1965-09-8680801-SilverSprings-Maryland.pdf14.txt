The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch depicts an object with an oval or disc-like shape.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Slowly diminishing 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One):    Yes       No      Don't know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes        No       Don't know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound           Noiseless
b. Color              Bright silver metallic   

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the width of the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Almost 1/4

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially suggest what trail or vapor trails, if any, the object was making.
