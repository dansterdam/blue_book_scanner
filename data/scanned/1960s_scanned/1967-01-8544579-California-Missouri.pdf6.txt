Flying Saucers' Visit
Central Missouri Area
Last week, strange objects
which were described as "fly¬
ing saucers" were reported
seen in the sky over various
areas of Central Missouri. Re¬
ports came in from Fayette
and Columbia.
According to a UPI story, an
unidentified flying object was
seen by several persons in the
Fayette area at about 7:15 p.m.
on Jan. 10. The object was de¬
scribed as being about 30 feet
in diameter, reddish in color
and giving off multicolored
lights as it moved rapidly
through the sky.
The object was said to be
traveling at a high altitude and
moving rapidly back and forth
over the Fayette area for about
10 minutes.
Dr. James Dusch, professor
at Central Methodist College,
said, "There is no doubt in my
mind that something was seen,
since this was reported by sev¬
eral independent observers."
Another report came from
near Columbia where a flashing
light was said to have been
seen in the sky about 7 p.m.
Jan. 8. The unidentified object
was described as moving at a
rapid rate.
The National Investigations
Committee on Aerial Phenom¬
ena (NICAP) has sent a three-
man team to the area to inves¬
tigate the sightings.
According to NICAP, the
group has received numerous
reports of unidentified flying
objects being seen over Central
Missouri during the past week.
While the Air Force contends
there has been no verified sight¬
ing of a UFO, the reports con¬
tinue to come in from various
citizens who stated they saw
something they could not ex¬
plain.
NICAP officials said they
were interested in the reports
and would attempt to get more
details about the sightings in
order to determine if they ap¬
peared to be authentic.
"We are anxious to interview
any persons who may have
seen these objects or have any
information about them," said
a NICAP spokesman.
UFO Reported Over California
An unidentified flying object
was reported seen over Califor¬
nia early last Monday morn¬
ing by the crew of a Trans
World Airlines flight.
TWA pilot Ralph K. Hunt and
a TWA stewardess said they
saw a bright light that appeared
to be chasing the jetliner at a
high speed as the airliner flew
over central California, ap¬
parently in the vicinity of
Bakersfield.
Hunt and the stewardess
said the light seemed to be
keeping pace with the jetliner
and at times appeared to be
gaining on it.
It was last sighted over the
San Joaquin Valley, according
to the TWA officials.
The Air Force said an inves¬
tigation was being made to de¬
termine what the object might
have been.
