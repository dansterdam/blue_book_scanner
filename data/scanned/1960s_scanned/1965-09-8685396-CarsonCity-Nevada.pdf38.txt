The image contains a photograph labeled "Rare Saucer Photograph". The photograph shows an unidentified flying object in the sky. There is also text on the page, which I will proceed to transcribe:

WAYNE, 19, a student pilot, crashed his car after something rushed swiftly back into the distance when he stopped his car to investigate. His car was damaged to the extent of $30.25 and he will receive payment of $44.00 in cash.

READER calls to tell us about a strange object in the sky over the Wichita Mountains. He saw this happen, too, is still scratching his head. 

I QUIT he yelled, and the picture was taken and that did it. He couldn't stand the mess any longer. He said, "I can't take the grind no more".

GUY ACROSS the desk says: "You tell 'em Mike, I quit."

HAVE TO GO was his farewelling remark as he slammed the door and walked out.

The picture above is the famous "Rare Saucer Photograph" which caused an uproar among scientists upon its publication in the July 1965 issue of the Oklahoma Journal Publishing Co.

If you can help the publication in any way, step forward and let them know.
