UFO Sighting and Photo, Redwood City, California, 2 Nov 64 - 5 Jan 65

This office is in receipt of a UFO report from the resident of Redwood City, California. The following is a suggested reply:

Dear Mr.
This is in reply to your observation of an unidentified flying object on the night of 2 November 1964 and the photograph taken of this object.
Completed analysis of the 35 mm film has been accomplished by a photo interpreter and a technical report is attached to a photocopy of your original letter.
The conclusions of the study of the photo analysis are as follows:
(1) No sharp photographic definition of the object could be determined on the chip. (2) The visible image could be a small film flaw or a duplicated flaw or chip in the gelatinous coating. (3) The conclusions reached after film analysis was that its size is uncertain.
This indicates an object of tremendous size while the remaining analysis dimensions indicated a much smaller object. The variations in temperature inversions in the area, one at 420 ft and the other at 600 ft, could account for these apparent discrepancies.
From the data presented, we are unable to make a positive identification of the object which you observed. The size of the object was certainly significant if the film chip size estimation is valid. 
This office appreciates your reporting this observation to our program and we value your interest and cooperation in this matter.
