The image does not contain a photograph. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire with various questions about a UFO sighting.

Transcription of the text in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? IT APPEARED SUDDENLY AND WAS GONE ABOUT 3-5 MINS LATER DESCENDING VERTICALLY.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): YES No (Don't Know).

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): YES (Severe C, E Clouds) No (Don't Know).

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound LKE SOMETHING BLOWING OR A SLIGHT HISS
b. Color BRIGHT WHITE, BLUE-WHITE 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and measure the size covered by the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object is covered by the match head?
Very little, less than 1/8 the width of match.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label it and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show the trail or vapor trails.
There is a simple hand-drawn sketch showing an arrow-shaped object.
