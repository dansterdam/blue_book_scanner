There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT
SEEMED SOLID OR TRANSPARENT, WHETHER IT HOVERED, MOVED SWIFTLY OR SLOWLY, OR EXPLODED, AND DESCRIBE THE SHAPE OR INDICATE IF IT
APPEARED SIMILAR TO ANY KNOWN OBJECT LIKE A STAR, PLANET, BALLOON, AIRCRAFT, ETC. STATE, A LIGHT OR
PROJECTION OF SOME KIND WAS EMITTED, DESCRIBE IT.

THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT IT APPEARED ROUND WITH A FLAT BOTTOM. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST 
FOR STARS) THAT IT HAD A RED STRIPE DOWN THE SIDE. EVERY TIME I SAW IT AFTER THAT IT
WAS LIKE THE ERASER OF A PENCIL (SHARP AT BOTH ENDS, LIGHTER, AND AS IT TRAVELED CONTINUALLY CHANGED SHAPE, LENGTH, ETC.)
