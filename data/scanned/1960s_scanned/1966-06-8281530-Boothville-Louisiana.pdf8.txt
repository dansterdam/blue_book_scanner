The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten letter addressed to "Dear Sir".

The text in the document is as follows:

"Dear Sir:

Perhaps you would be interested in these drawings of the UFO we saw, plus the other strange objects we saw. I won't call the other objects U.F.O.'s only because they were far away. I thought these drawings would help you as to keep a record of all the weird sightings we have seen.

Yours truly,
[Redacted]"
