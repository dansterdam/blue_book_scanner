The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing an observation of lights in the sky near Southampton College, Long Island, New York on October 31, 1966.

31 Oct 66
Reported watching and several other students from Southampton College observed lights in the sky that remained stationary at an elevation of approximately 25 degrees. The observers did not notice and noise or any type of structure. The object just remained basically stationary in the southeast during the observation period. The lights flashed from time to time and appeared to be moving from its position.
Conclusion:
Although there is incomplete data to warrant a comprehensive evaluation, it appears that the witnesses were watching an unidentifiable object at an elevation of 25 degrees and at an elevation of 18 degrees. Series which had been reported previously as an UFO did not rise on this particular night until approximately mid-night, and is excluded as a possible explanation.
