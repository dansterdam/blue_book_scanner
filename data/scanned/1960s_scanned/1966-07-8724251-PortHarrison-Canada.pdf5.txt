The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with text describing a conversation about weather balloons being launched from Walops Island and not reaching Canada, as well as information about negative results from a balloon control center in Colorado.

Conversation with Wallops Island revealed that they have only been launching weather balloons lately and they would not reach Canada. However, if they do find anything they will call us. Observize they are negative.

Conversation with ORR revealed that they launched three balloons on 16 Jul 66 however, they went down within 24 hours. No other launches would account for observations. He had been up in Canada at this time and had heard of nothing unusual up there. He said it would be unlikely that any of their balloons would be responsible for they normally don't get across the Hudson Bay before going westward. Also said the three were numerous radiosondes launches in Canada that launch daily and that our weather man should be/being made aware of this matter.

NCAR, Boulder, Colorado reported negative results. Dr. Morris said that he did not know of any balloons to account for the observations.
