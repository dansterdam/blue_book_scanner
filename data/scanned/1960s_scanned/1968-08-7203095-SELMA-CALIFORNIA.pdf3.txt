The object suddenly grew up and rushed away. 
The object appeared to be a very bright light, larger than an automobile headlight at any time. The object did not move in a straight line but rather in a definite zig-zag course at a very rapid rate.
The object made no sound that I could hear (being so distant).
The object was presummedly moving in my general direction, but I am sorry I cannot estimate the object's speed. Assuming it was not too distant, the speed must have been phenomenal.
