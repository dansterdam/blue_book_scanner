There is a 35mm slide attached to the document. The document does not contain any human faces, so I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.

Dear Mr. Baca:

Attached is your 35mm slide taken in the spring of 1964 at Roswell, New Mexico.

Request: you fill out the attached FID Form 164 to assist us in evaluating the photograph. Please return the form to Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr, USAF, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433. In addition, data regarding the camera such as aperture, speed, lens used, type of camera, etc would be helpful.

If you cannot recall the exact date, an approximation will be sufficient. Of particular importance is the elevation and attitude of the object. This should be obtainable since a telephone pole is visible in the lower left corner of the photo.

You will be informed of our evaluation upon completion.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr
Major, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
