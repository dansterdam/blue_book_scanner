About 8 p.m. 7-8-65 a bright object was observed traveling across the southern sky and going to the northwest. It was very bright and this object was sighted for several minutes. This was a bright full moon night. All other stars and planets were clearly visible. The object would disappear and reappear at intervals during the sighting. The object was observed by several people in the area and was traveling very rapidly at an estimated speed of several hundred miles per hour. The object then went out of sight to the northwest.
