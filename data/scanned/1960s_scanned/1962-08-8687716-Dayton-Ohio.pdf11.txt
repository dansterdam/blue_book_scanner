The image does not contain a photograph, but rather three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon, and instructions to place an "A" and "B" on the line. The second and third sketches show landscape scenes viewed through a curved frame, presumably to illustrate how to complete the larger sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, see how you can apply the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
