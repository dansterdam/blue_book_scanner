Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

A strange and very unusal event took place on 4 aug 1960 about 2115 hours near Sierra Vista Arizona and was reported by a reliable and respectable person who observed this phenomena. The object was about 200 feet in diameter and was dark grey in color and hovering about 75 feet off the ground and was cigar shaped with no lights. It hovered for about 3 - 4 minutes and then took off at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.
