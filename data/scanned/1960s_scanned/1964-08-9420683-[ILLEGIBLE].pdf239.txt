Dear Sara:

This communication is to you as to the time identified object which I mentioned. Many observers are now -200 ft-velocity 400-500 mph clearly lighted object seems to hover maneuver and then accelerate to a high rate of speed. This was sighted by Air Force control tower operators and others present. This object was not a plane, satellite or meteor. Air Force and other proper authorities have been informed. Copies of reports there could be more made of the incident.
One like the above date I and recall ever seeing, and this is ready attention me, and I am unable to accept.
