This image appears to contain an illustration or diagram rather than a photograph. The image shows a skyline with a series of angled lines and a compass-like object in the corner, which seem to be providing instructions or guidance for sighting and observing an object in the sky.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the spot high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the spot where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there? Draw a sketch of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
