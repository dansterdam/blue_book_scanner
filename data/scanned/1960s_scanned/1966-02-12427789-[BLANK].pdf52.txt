deed, the use of generic terms such as "UFOs" or "flying saucers" has served to confuse the issue by the implication of common origin.

Because of its air defense responsibility, the United States Air Force has undertaken to investigate all reports of unidentified flying objects over the United States. The number of sightings reported and investigated between 1947 and 1960 is shown in the accompanying Table.

Evaluation of these reports is difficult. The observations are frequently fragmentary, and reports by different observers of the same phenomenon are often dissimilar, or even irreconcilable. There is an understandable tendency for the observer to exaggerate the spectacular aspects of his observations. In many instances, statements are made concerning distance, size, and velocity which are without foundation. A small object, close by, may appear larger than a large object far away. Also, many deliberate hoaxes have been perpetrated (for example, involving double-exposure photography). After allowances are made for these possibly confusing factors, the accepted scientific procedure is to attempt an explanation of the observations in terms of natural phenomena. Only if an observation is not readily explicable in terms of known phenomena does the scientist bring to bear additional investigatory powers.
