41 Ovington Square
Knightsbridge
London, S.W. 3, England

Dear Mr. Hennessey:

We have researched our records here at Kirtland and no information relative to "Project Bounce."

It is my suggestion if you still desire this information that further inquiries be directed to the Secretary Air Force, Attention: SAF-0I, Washington D.C.

Sincerely,

JASPER A. WESTBROOK, Colonel, USAF
Vice Commander
