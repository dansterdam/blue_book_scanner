The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Analysis was requested on a piece of 35 mm film supposedly exhibiting an unidentified flying object. The film said to have been exposed and processed but no object had been seen on the film. We were unable to find any image on the film due to the fact that the film was completely blank. This blank condition is apparently due to the photographic material having been heavily fogged, possibly due to improper processing or handling. Any attempt to scrutinize the blank film would be futile and would not yield any meaningful information.
