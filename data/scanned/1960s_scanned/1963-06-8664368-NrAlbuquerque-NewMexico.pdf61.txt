NZ Youth Encounters UFO
The following is an account of an encounter between a youth and what appears to be a UFO, as reported in North City, New Zealand on June 18, 1962. From where he was situated in the garden, he noticed two bright lights in the sky coming directly toward him from the southwest. After about a minute they slowed down and were hovering about 250 yards away. After 5 seconds had passed, the lights suddenly moved off at a terrific speed. Their color was described as being pure white. No other witnesses were found and the local officials received no other UFO reports for that night.
