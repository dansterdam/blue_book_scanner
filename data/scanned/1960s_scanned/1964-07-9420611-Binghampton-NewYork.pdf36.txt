Text found in the document:

It was about 10:15 p.m., and remained fixed in relation to nearby stars until 1:15 a.m.
At about 10:15 p.m., he said he saw a plane approach the object through his binoculars. He said that the plane, which was in "line of sight with the object", was flying south of Binghamton, from east to west. The plan said he could see the outline become very bright, about 11:15 p.m., and that the man on duty also caught sight of the object.
He also reported that he telephoned back to the radar control area to advise them to look for the object. But the object disappeared while he was still on the phone, and was not detected by the radar equipment.
He said that he lost sight of the plane shortly afterwards. The object moved from the observer's left to right about 11:15 a.m., when it disappeared behind Ely Park Hill.
The public information officer at Rome suggested the the sighting base would be ably to supply more information if an investigator would come to the base. Lt. Winlant Harold, an information officer at the Hancock base, said that he knew of no reports of this phenomenon. However, that he would be informed of the incidents by residents who report having seen unusual objects. Most reports last night said a "bright moving object" was sighted at various hills are reported to have seen something which was red and green and cone shaped. They said no noise was emerging from the object.
A Broad Street woman also reported the phenomena to be red and green. The reports began to come in at 9 p.m. and continued until 2:30 a.m. There were several reports of an object observed over Binghamton. An 87-year-old resident, who lives on Broad Street, said that she and her brother saw an object with a triangular shape (previous was a quotation) about 10:15 p.m. Tuesday. She said that it couldn't have been an airplane.
