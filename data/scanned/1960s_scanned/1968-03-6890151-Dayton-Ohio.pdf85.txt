The image contains a sketch and diagram related to a UFO sighting. The sketch appears to show the position and movement of multiple objects in the sky. There is also a compass diagram that seems to provide information about the altitude and direction of the observed objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 2 at 6:00, 2 more at 6:22. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
