The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from the Project Blue Book archives.

Photographs taken by investigators and Dr. Roy Craig - original photographs were lost by investigators who made copies of them.

It should be noted that on the mornings of my department and myself sighted objects we were unable to identify as police department have made sightings as well and find that were also making sightings.

We do not want anyone to make any statements that would give the impression that anything is intentionally withheld from the public or ridicule. We know that we have seen "unidentified" whatever also do not have any desire for publicity, or make any statements that might tend to stimulate this.

I am sure that Dr. Roy Craig or Robins Air Force Base will gladly advise you of their findings, we have not been shown them since they left here. I am sure you will understand our position.

Yours truly,
Eugene A. Ellis, Chief
City Police
