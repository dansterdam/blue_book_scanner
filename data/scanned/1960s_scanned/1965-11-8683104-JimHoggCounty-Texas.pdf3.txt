Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. 
Gentlemen:

I am enclosing five reports of sightings of unidentified flying objects, the first of which I reported by telephone to a Lt. B. at Laredo Air Force Base, Texas, and since he informed me that you would be contacted by Washington, I have continued to make more observations. Today I called the Laredo Base again and Captain Ellis suggested that I write to you direct with these reports.

I am very much interested in knowing what it is I am seeing, if at all possible, and I would very much appreciate a reply from your good offices after evaluation of these reports. Thank you for your attention.

Yours very truly,

Encls.
