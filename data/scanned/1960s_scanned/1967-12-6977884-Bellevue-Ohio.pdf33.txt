The image contains two illustrations. The top illustration shows a compass rose with the cardinal directions labeled. The bottom illustration shows a silhouette of a person standing on a road between two hills or mountains.

SA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH ONE SIGHTING WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN. PLACE A "C" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE COMPASS BEARING WAS TAKEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW. PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND PLACE A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE APPROXIMATE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL OF THE PHENOMENON.

DIRECTIONS CONCERNING SIGHTINGS OR SIGHTINGS WERE PRIMARILY TO GATHER DATA THAT MIGHT ASSIST IN EVALUATING REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA STATISTICALLY AND MATHEMATICALLY.
