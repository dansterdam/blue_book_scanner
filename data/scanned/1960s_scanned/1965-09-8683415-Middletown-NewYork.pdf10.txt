Shortly after 7:30 PM, Monday, September 6, 1965, two sightings of lights in the sky were reported to the civilian police, and to the New York Air National Guard. The lights were said to resemble bright stars and were traveling across the sky. They did not move at one point for about 10 to 15 minutes. These lights were seen simultaneously by several witnesses in the area of Middletown, New York.

The local police contacted a nearby Air Force radar installation, but were unable to get any information from them regarding the objects. The Air National Guard also made inquiries but were told that the objects were not picked up on their radar screens.

Several witnesses who were on the ground watching the lights said the lights resembled the strobe lights on a jet aircraft. But the objects did not make the characteristic noise of a jet, nor did they appear to be traveling at jet speed. The witnesses said the lights were traveling in a somewhat erratic course, "darting" back and forth across the sky.

The lights were observed for about an hour, when they suddenly disappeared from view. No aircraft or stars were observed in the area at the time.

The description of the lights given by the witnesses would seem to indicate the possibility that they were seeing some type of unconventional aerial craft, rather than conventional aircraft or celestial objects.
