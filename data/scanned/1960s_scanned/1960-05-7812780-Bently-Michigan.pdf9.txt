FLYING OBJECT

Introduction: 
On June 17, 1960, an object was observed at University Heights, New York 53, N.Y. The piece of metal was about 3" x 3" by about 0.020" thick. The object appeared to be heavily mortised on both sides with a structure of the metal and an identification of the nature or composition of the metal.

The Sample:
The sample appeared to have one as-rolled edge. Aggregate deposits accreted on the larger surface, on the other side were as cracked or chipped areas on the small edge. The portions contained gray to tan-like inclusions.

Procedure and Results:
The sample was taken from the metal by bending. The remaining metal was cut into two pieces. One piece was polished and etched for metallographic examination. The remaining piece of metal and the sample were subjected to spectrographic analysis. 

Figure 1, Plate 19606 - 100X is the photomicrograph.

The results of the spectrographic analyses were as follows:
