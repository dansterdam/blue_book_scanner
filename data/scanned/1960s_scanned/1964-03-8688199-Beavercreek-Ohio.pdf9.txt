The image appears to contain a diagram and instructions related to a UFO sighting report. 

The diagram shows a sketch of an object in the sky, with angular measurements and instructions to indicate how high the object was seen above the horizon when it was first observed.

There is also an instruction to "Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made." This suggests the image may have originally contained a hand-drawn sketch or diagram showing the path or motion of the observed UFO.

Additionally, there is an instruction to indicate how many objects were seen, if there was more than one, and to draw a picture showing their arrangement and the direction they were moving.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.
90°
75°
60°
45°
30°
15°
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
