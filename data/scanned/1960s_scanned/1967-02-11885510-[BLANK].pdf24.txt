are similar to those of some other cosmic sources and the strength of the signals under the most favorable assumption exceeds by several orders of magnitude the strength that we can reasonably expect from civilizations of Class 2 or 3.

The criteria which an artificial signal from another civilization should satisfy, according to Kardshev, are:
(1) The small angular size of the source. This he considers an extremely important if not a decisive indication of the artificiality of the source.
(2) Maximum intensity of signal in the range 3-10 cm.
(3) Variability of the signal in time.

Much of the discussion at the Byurakan Conference was centered on these criteria, some participants declaring that many natural objects could satisfy them. V.I. Slysh (Byurakan Conference, pp 61-67) thinks that a simultaneous fulfillment of these criteria by a cosmic source would constitute a presumption (but not a proof) of its cosmic origin. The question whether a cosmic radio source is artificial or not can be settled according to Slysh only by a systematic survey of the whole sky by means of a radio interferometer with a resolving power 0.1". This at least would eliminate all sources that are clearly natural, so that attention could be concentrated on a few suspicious objects.

He does not indicate whether the Soviet technical capacity is
