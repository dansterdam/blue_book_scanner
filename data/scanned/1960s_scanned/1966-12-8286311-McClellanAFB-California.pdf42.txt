Dear Mr. -----

This replies to your letter of December 19, 1966, in which you requested information on any sightings which may have been responsible for your unusual observation.

A review of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac for 1966, published yearly, indicates that Jupiter was in the sights of approximately 15,000,000 people on this date and was quite bright and could have accounted for the observation.

Since your sightings occurred outside the limits of the United States, we are unable to cross check your case for information purposes only. We will be happy to assist you in continuing this investigation should you have any additional questions.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. RIEDMAN, JR.
