ASTRONOMY

Brilliant Evening Star

Venus outshines all other planets and stars. The vernal equinox in March still begins the spring in the Northern Hemisphere. 

BY JAMES STOKLEY

* SHINING MANY TIMES more bril-liantly than any other star or planet now visible in the evening. Venus is becoming more and more conspicuous. Gaining in its gibbous phase day by day,it remains visible during March for about three hours after sundown.

Venus attains its greatest brilliancy on March 11, when it shines with a light about 44.4 million miles, but by the end of the month the distance has reduced to 37 million miles. This variation in distance causes the swings between sun and earth to mid-June.

At the beginning of March you will find Venus low in the west-southwest, rising and setting about 3 hours after the sun. By March 31, it will have moved considerably farther west, setting about 4 1/2 hours after the sun.

Although only about one-sixtieth as bright as the sun, Venus is at present the brightest object in the sky after the moon. If you will look for it by March 31, you will have to look high in the west, soon after sundown, to see it.

Venus attains its greatest brilliancy near the earth at mid-March and after that becomes less and less conspicuous, all through April, as it moves farther and farther from the earth and is lit less strongly by the sun.

Other Planets:
Mercury sometimes visible low in the west for a short time after sunset—but too close to the sun for comfortable observation. Mars, too, is too close to the sun to be seen easily.

Jupiter, the "big star", is part of Canis Major, the great dog. It is the brightest star in that region of the sky, and is still well up in the south and southwest as it gets dark.

Saturn, which is rising a bit earlier each night, is located in the southern sky as soon as Venus disappears from view in the west. Saturn is shining higher than Virgo, the virgin, and above them the brilliant Spica. Between Saturn and Spica hangs the bright star Arcturus and below them Regulus, in Leo, the lion. 

Still farther to the right (shown partly on the northern sky), swung north on its star is the brilliant Aldebaran. This star is reddish in color, and above Taurus, the bull, the Pleiades, with their six or seven conspicuous stars, make a bright cluster almost overhead.

High in the northeast you can see Ursa Major, the great bear, whose seven bright stars are familiar to most of us as the Big Dipper. Below the pointers, whose direction leads you to Polaris, the pole star, part of Ursa Minor the little bear.
