Fading and blowing odors seemed difficult to the 
Senses. As it we're like a breeze remindentr of...

The object was about 11:30 p.m. which were an unusual
grayish white slightly brighter than the full moon. It 
would not normal be noted but was quite noticeable until
it gradually became dimmed and obscured as though
it were or sort of went right into a distant cloud cover.
It did not wobble or vary in shape but seemed to gradually
grow dim and disappear. We could hear no sound, but the 
whole incident was quite abnormal and not accounted for 
in any other way. While we could obviously have been
a meteor or some sort of unusual astronomical phenomena
it did not seem to be observed in the normal manner of
a meteor. The object itself did not seem to have any
visible movement, but rather seem to diminish in
brightness until it disappeared entirely.
