PROJECT 10073 RECORD
10. CONCLUSION
(BEARING MAIN)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers described the object as "light-self-luminous" and elevation from ground was estimated at a point of light. It appeared to be a point of light changing colors to red and green. There was no sound. The object was observed at an elevation of 20 deg in the northwest. The observers are apparently reliable, and their observation is considered to be accurate as to elevation and azimuth. The in-and-out movement and sudden disappearance of the object is somewhat unusual.
