Dear Sirs,

It was about 10:00 p.m. on the night of June 9, 1967, I have been rather reluctant to report this. I was looking up at the sky through my telescope. It was a clear night, and I just happened to see this object passing from east-west very fast. It was only in view for about three seconds. The shape was oblong, it was white with a blue haze around it. It would have been about the size of a Satellite crossing the sky. I am twelve years old. I have read about them many times, and I know I didn't imagine it. It was a hallucination, or anything.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
