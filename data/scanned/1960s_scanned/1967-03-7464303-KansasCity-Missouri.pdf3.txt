The image contains a hand-drawn sketch that appears to be part of an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. The sketch includes a compass-like diagram and instructions for the observer to make notes about the sighting. There is also a blank area where the observer was instructed to draw a picture showing the motion and arrangement of the observed object(s).

27. In the following sketch, imagine that the chief you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same line the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

(The compass-like diagram and sketching instructions are shown in the image)

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, or "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

(The observer has sketched a very faint object in the blank area)

29. If there was more than one object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

(The observer has written some handwritten notes in the blank space)
