NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
Inter-Office Correspondence

DATE November 14, 1966

TO Prof. T. Allen Hynek, FROM Dr. E. H. T. Whitten,
Chairman, Dept. Astronomy Dept. Geology

Dear [redacted],

The specimen is certainly not a UFO. Clearly it is a metamorphic rock. In that it is a piece of metamorphosed quartzite. Having come from the general region of Aberdeen, Maryland, it could well be a relatively local origin because there is a wide assortment of metamorphic rocks to the west and northwest of that town.

It was somewhat surprising to find such scant information about the location of the "find." I would strongly suggest that the Air Force be encouraged about informants to provide accurate location of "sightings" - a little sketch map would help if any report resulted from an investigation team.

Sincerely,
[redacted]
