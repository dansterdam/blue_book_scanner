Case: 2433

Attn: 	TDPT (UFO)

Reference:	Your letter of 14 February
To:	Lt. Col. Rector Quintanilla

1. I enclose evaluation cards for all four cases you requested. I believe these cards are unduly brief. My notation on my copy of the case calls for additional investigation of my opinion that the four cases represent only a single case.

2. I regret also, from your standpoint, that all four cases must in my opinion be classified as "unknown".

3. I would rate the 12 July 1968, Omaha, Nebraska, case as the weakest in this category, and the ones of Gerlach, Wisconsin, the strongest. I obtained a good tape recording in the Omaha case, and will send you a copy of the classification of the witnesses as part of my summary. Except for one or two points, particularly the matter of the sighting possibly being caused by the ejection of a seaplane, I would hold that transponders show a good case.
