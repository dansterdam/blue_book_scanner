It is only now that I have your address. I would like to inform you of the following: Object observed en the 18th of September 1954, at Anedonia (Orebello), a town on the coast of Tuscany.
Blue-green, jade light; with golden hues, diffuse, dazzling, followed a zig-zag path southward. It appeared (it seemed to me) to be motionless for a time (it seemed then, always directed southward), vanished on a steady course, leaving us astonished and shaken.
We do not think it could have been a celestial body or phenomenon.
I will try, at the foot of this letter, to sketch both the luminous sawyer-shaped body we saw, as well as its trajectory.
