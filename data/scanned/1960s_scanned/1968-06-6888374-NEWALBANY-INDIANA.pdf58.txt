8A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE SCENE OF THE PHENOMENON PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

As mentioned on the diagram, this shows the directions of the phenomenon as it was first seen (an "X") and last seen (a "+") in relation to the compass. The handwritten notes provide additional details about the sighting.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "+" WITH A LINE TO GRAPHICALLY SHOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "+". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED, OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS ITEM.

The two smaller sketches show silhouetted figures in a landscape setting, with one figure in the foreground and the other in the background. These are likely meant to illustrate the movement of the phenomenon between the "X" and "+" positions.
