13 January 1966
Wayne, New Jersey 

From the description and other available information it appears that the witness observed an aircraft. The only description given was that of a bright blue-white light that was traveling toward the northwest with an erratic flight path. The witness himself compared the light to the brightness of an aircraft strobe light and estimated the speed of the unidentified object to be that of a jet aircraft. Considering the high density air-traffic in the New York area it is felt that an aircraft was observed. Without additional information to eliminate a possible aircraft evaluation the case is being carried as such.
