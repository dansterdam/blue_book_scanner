Object : Unusual sighting
You have asked me to give you information regarding an unusual sighting which I witnessed on October 13, 1965 at about 9 pm. The object seemed to be a luminous cigar-shaped formation, very bright, which moved without any sound and at a considerable speed, passing successively in front of my view. I kept this object under observation for a few minutes until it disappeared in the distance.
My observations were made from the vicinity of my home located between Chilly-Mazarin and Soeaux, in the department of Seine. I would be happy to provide you with any additional information you may need.
Please accept, Sir, the expression of my highest regards.
