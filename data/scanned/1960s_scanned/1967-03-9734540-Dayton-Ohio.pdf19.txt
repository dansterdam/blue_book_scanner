Text from the document:

MRS. QUINTANILLA,
I received a call from Mrs. [redacted] phone of approximately 2:15 hrs. Shortly before they called Mrs. [redacted] was on the way home and saw a large bright object and the children saw it too. She said it appeared to be similar to the object she has reported as sighting recently. As she entered the driveway the object came closer. It then entered the house and called for. I talked to both her and Mr. [redacted] for about 15 minutes. She said the object seemed to be stationary and changing attitude in more or less strictly vertical motion for a considerable time. I asked if they had a camera with film and they said no. I then advised that they call the police and then contact me again. When I had not heard from them shortly, I called the Quintanilla residence. The Quintanillas confirmed that the Smith's had called them and they had called the police. At this time I called the Dayton PD. They confirmed that the Smith's had called and reported the incident but the police had not yet arrived. At this time I called the Quintanilla residence again and they confirmed that the police had still not arrived. I talked to the Smiths again and they reported that the object was still there, but the police had not yet arrived.
