Analysis and Conclusions: 1) WITNESS REPORTS A WHITE LIGHT WHICH APPEARED VERY BRIGHT AND THEN SUDDENLY VANISHED. WITNESS STATED THAT THE LIGHT WAS DEFINITELY NOT A PLANE OR ANY OTHER KNOWN OBJECT. 2) SINCE THERE WERE NO RADAR REPORTS OR OTHER SIGHTING IN THE AREA, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE OBJECT. 3) WITNESS APPEARS TO BE RELIABLE AND HER STORY IS REASONABLE, BUT THIS IS AN ISOLATED SIGHTING WITH NO CONFIRMING EVIDENCE. THEREFORE, THIS CASE MUST BE LISTED AS UNIDENTIFIED.
