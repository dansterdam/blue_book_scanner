Excellent contact, how serious - am sure sighting was authentic. Probably space ship coming or going at some mission. Pilot surely saw plane, but am sure he didn't want to land, come close or have any contact with air traffic. All it was is routine mission of an isolated or unmanned space ship not wanting any contact with air or ground traffic.
