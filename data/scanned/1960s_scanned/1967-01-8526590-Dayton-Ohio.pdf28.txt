SEEING UFO FILM

24 i 1958

Universal City Studios
Universal City, California 91608

1. Enclosed are two stills that were obtained in this case for analysis/study. The film itself from which these stills were taken is being retained by USAF Intelligence Division, Los Angeles, pending further analysis. It is likely that the original film, now in their possession, will be forwarded to your office later for your information and analysis. The apparent motion and apparent rate of travel of the object as shown in the film are probably one of the most significant and interesting features, and are consequently the subject of special interest and scrutiny.

2. Should further analysis be required, it will be necessary to obtain the film from the USAF Intelligence Division, Los Angeles, for that purpose.
