1. Mr. J.S. Air Force investigator who resides near Eagle River, Wisconsin, related to us a siting that he made at about 6:15 A.M. 15 April 1961. He witnessed the landing and take-off of a disc-shaped object in a wooded area. This object was reported to be about 50 feet in diameter and was witnessed by the investigator and his family. This resulted in considerable publicity by television, radio, and the press.

2. Mr. J.S. gave photographic slides of the object to representatives of a number of private organizations and institutions and was told by them that he would be contacted on the matter of publicity.

3. We are in well-receptive to a well-investigated and documented report in his community and his honesty was vouched for by the local judge and district attorney.

4. For your information, a copy of the incident is attached (Attachment #3). The expression "ICAP" in the report stands for the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, a private UFO study group.

5. ATIC will advise your agency of any further developments on this case.
