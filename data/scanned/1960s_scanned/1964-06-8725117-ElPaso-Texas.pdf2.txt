BASE 0 O 8330
REFERENCE the attached letter from ( ...  ) requesting information on an unidentified flying object on 25 JUN 64, El Paso, TEXAS.
1. The above sighting was investigated by the 916th Bombardment Wing (L) Detachment 4, Biggs Air Force Base, Texas, and a report of the findings was forwarded to the project officer at ATIC prior to the sighting. Enclosed with the letter was the full description of the sighting.
2. The film was forwarded to Dallas, Texas for processing, although it was considered that probably nothing unusual would be found. This conjecture was proved correct, as the film showed nothing but clouds.
3. The witness's first description of "a silvery disc-shaped cone's ascension" by two highly regarded citizens accords with the balloon and its ascension in air. This case is considered closed as a balloon observation.
