On the evening of the second of September, sometime between 10 and
11:30 p.m., my husband and I watched a moving object in the sky over, or
slightly to the north of, Healdsburg, California. We were sitting on the
beach of the Russian river, enjoying the cool evening when he pointed out that
one of the larger stars was moving. The light which we saw was that of the
same size and brilliance as some of the other stars or planets. I
am sorry I do not know my constellations well enough to say which it
passed through. When we first noticed it, it was at approximately onepoint four, and it would say 10:30 p.m. We watched it. It continued at a fairly steady pace.
It took over a half and hour to reach the tree tops to the east of us, but it never seemed any closer than a star. There was no sound that could be connected to it, and it would have been unnoticeable except for the movement. The oddest thing about it was the
absolute stillness and quietude about until I had drawn on my back
to check my observations, with no concer that the object's motion was there. Definitely it moved faster than any airplane.
