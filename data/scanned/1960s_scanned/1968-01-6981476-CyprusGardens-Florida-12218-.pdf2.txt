The image contains a black-and-white photograph of a large, irregularly shaped rock or meteorite. The rock appears to be covered in a white, snowy or frosted-like texture, with some darker areas visible on the surface. There are three smaller images or slides shown below the main photograph, but they do not appear to contain any human faces.
