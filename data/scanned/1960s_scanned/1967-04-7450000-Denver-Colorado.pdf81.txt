14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? Yes.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes, in front of cumulus clouds.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Absolutely no sound associated with it.
b. Color - Bright silvery white, metallic in appearance.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object would have been covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? About the size of a match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object (e.g., size, color, number, location, speed, direction, etc.) and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Draw an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

(Handwritten sketch)
