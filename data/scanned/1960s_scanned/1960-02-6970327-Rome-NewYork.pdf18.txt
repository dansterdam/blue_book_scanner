UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
WEATHER BUREAU
Santa Monica, California

May 19, 1960

Mrs. [REDACTED]
Los Angeles 18, Calif.

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

In answer to your question, I will only show the general characteristics of certain observations to ascertain weather conditions.

1. None of the balloons released by personnel at this station were equipped with lighting units on the evening of February 5th or 6th.

2. I have attached a map of the local area indicating the line of flight for soundings made during this period. Also attached is a copy of wind data as compiled for such soundings.

3. No free balloon will remain stationary, nor appear to remain stationary for this duration, regardless of the wind speed.

Balloons released from this station have, as a general rule, an ascension rate of at least 600 feet per minute; this, under normal rising conditions, indicates that within about 3 minutes unilluminated and 8 minutes when equipped with a lighting unit - the balloon is lost to sight. This cannot be verified, as the balloons are not tracked in flight. I regret that I cannot be of more assistance in this matter, but the responsibility for the release of the point of release remains solely with the Weather Bureau.

If this shall be of some assistance to you and the facilities require office records to obtain other such information will be furnished.

Very truly yours,
[SIGNATURE]
OIC
