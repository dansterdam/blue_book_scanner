radio-frequency line is not greater than that of the continuous
galaxy radio-frequency emission in the same spectral range,
which is equal to 10-21.5 cw/m2 ster/cps for comparatively large
angular distances from the Milky Way band. In the Milky Way the
intensity of the hydrogen radio-frequency line is several dozen
times greater than the magnitude at the higher galactic latitudes.
As an example, assume that d1 - d2 = 80 m and that the other
civilization is 10 light years away (R = 10) Substituting
these values into equation (2), W must be greater than or equal
to 100 watts/cps, which is already feasible. It is quite
possible that the other civilizations could have a much greater
transmission capability and much larger antenna systems than does
our civilization.  Either or both of these conditions could allow
communications over larger distances.  Much larger reflectors are
being considered which could also increase the radius of communications possibilities.  The calculation has shown that communications
with other civilizations can be accomplished with modern equipment.
