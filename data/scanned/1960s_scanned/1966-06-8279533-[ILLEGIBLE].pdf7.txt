Text from the document:

For the record:

I spotted an object with a slight gliding motion several feet from the ground. The object hovered for several minutes, about 12 feet off the ground, possibly 15 feet in diameter. It appeared to be about 20 minutes before setting on the ground. It was about the same size as a manhole cover, maybe slightly larger. After the object appeared to land, the area was soon observed by various persons, including myself. The object was tilted at an angle and did not appear to be secured to the ground. It had a dull silver color and no visible markings or windows. After the object departed, the area was approached, but there was no apparent evidence of its having been there. The ground did not appear to have been disturbed. It appeared to lift off easily and depart rapidly without any noise or fumes. The entire incident lasted approximately 15-20 minutes.
