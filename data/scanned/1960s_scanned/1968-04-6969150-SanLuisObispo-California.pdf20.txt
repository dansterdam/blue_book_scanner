The object was a light color shape that extended below and above the horizon. It had a bright center like flash in the middle which made it seem to expand in size and then contract. There were faint areas on the edges of the light that seemed to flare out from the main body. The light appeared to be pulsing and the flares from the edges were faint. The motion was similar to rising and floating smoke or a 'meatball' going up and down with variations in brightness within the overall shape. The sighting lasted for several minutes.
