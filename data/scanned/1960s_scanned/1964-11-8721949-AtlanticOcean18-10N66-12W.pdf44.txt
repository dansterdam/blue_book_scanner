DETAILED EVENTS OF THE EVENING OF 19 NOVEMBER 1964 WHILE CONDUCTING OPERATIONS ON BOARD THE USS GYATT IN LATITUDE 30°41.5' NORTH 66°38' WEST.

The radar used was the SPS-49 Radar, operating in the 350 me range, manufactured by the ITT Thompson Co., Wayne, N.J. Videotapes were taken with the Universal Shipboard Radarkope Recorder secured to the Heavy Military Intercontinental Departments, Geneseo Corp., Syracuse, New York. The range of the video shows is approximately 25 miles.

The Naval aircraft involved was "SALT SPRAY 26", an F-8H aircraft from squadron RESIGHT, Puerto Rico. This aircraft was flying at an altitude of thirty thousand feet, when it encountered the SPS-49 and began making a run on the USS GYATT. At time 2120Q, "SALT SPRAY 26" made a final pass closer our ship, at which time our ship's ordnance increased his altitude to 6,000 feet in an attempt to maintain communications. It is believed that "SALT SPRAY 26" could have had some object on his port side but our photographs do not show anything.

At approximately 2110Q, the SPS-49 was jammed for a short period of time by the jamming equipment of unknown source of the jamming is unknown.

The approximate range and bearing from GYATT to "SALT SPRAY 26" for applicable pictures is listed in the accompanying sheet.
