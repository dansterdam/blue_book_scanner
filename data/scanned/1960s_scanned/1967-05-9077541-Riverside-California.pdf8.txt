A meteor-like object appeared to approx. 30 miles from a lighted area. It was a reddish-orange color and moved very fast. It was bright enough to see my mother and sisters. It made a whining noise and seemed to descend rapidly. I turned my head to see it and it seemed to disappear in the distance. It was not a plane, satellite, or helicopter. I could not identify it.
