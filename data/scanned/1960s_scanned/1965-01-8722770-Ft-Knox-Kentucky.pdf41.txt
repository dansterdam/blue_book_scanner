THOMAS C. TURNER -- WITNESS:
I was in my back yard on the night of 10 December 1964. A Luminous object, hovering high over my house, drew my attention. I watched it for about 20 minutes. The object was round, disc-shaped, with a glowing dome in the center. It seemed to be about 500-600 feet in diameter. The object was silent, moved up and down, and from side to side, without any noticeable forward motion. A Concord man reported sighting the same or a similar object at about the same time. The bright light and lower strobing lights stopped after a similar object was sighted over the hills. The downward motion and hovering led me to assume it was not an aircraft, but some sort of advanced aerial vehicle. REMARKS: This report seems to contain a good description of a typical UFO sighting. The witness is apparently reliable, and his observations are consistent with many other similar reports.
