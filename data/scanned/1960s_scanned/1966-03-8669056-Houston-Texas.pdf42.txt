[Redacted] of WHIO called on 2 Mar 66. Does not want to report a UFO sighting, however was interested if we had any reports at approximately 1145am, 2 Mar 66. He saw a light at low altitude, similar to aircraft, however, he did not hear any noise, it later turned red but he still did not hear any noise, observed for five minutes, light was traveling east. If we have any reports at that time in the next couple of days would we please give a call - 513-426-2330, was just kind of interested to know if anyone else noticed it. (Sgt Moody later remarked that it was probably an aircraft).
