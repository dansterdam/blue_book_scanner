CIVILS REPORT: Described as possible rocket
entry. Greenish color with white patterning
and zig-zag motion. No photos.
11. COMMENTS
Although duration was not given, it was
reported as a "very brief" sighting, and thus
would be unable to provide sufficient data to
associate it with reentrieg; therefore, it
is more probable that the sighting was a
fireball. Color and flight indicate this.
There is enough information to classify
this as a meteoric sighting.

O Possibly Aircraft
O Was Astronomical
