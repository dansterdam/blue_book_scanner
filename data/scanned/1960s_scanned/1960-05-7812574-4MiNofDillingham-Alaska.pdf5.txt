See Photos That they are supposed to be saucers Typical of the many reports received from the area of Dillingham, Alaska. The sighting was made at approximately 20:00 hours (8:00 PM) on May 7, 1960. The weather was clear and the object was observed for about 1-2 minutes before disappearing behind a mountain. The object was described as round, metallic in appearance, and much larger than any known aircraft. It was estimated to be about 50-100 feet in diameter and traveling at a very high rate of speed, much faster than any known aircraft. The observer called the local Air Force installation to report the sighting and was advised that it was probably a meteor or weather balloon. However, the observer was convinced that what he saw was neither a meteor nor a weather balloon, but rather an unidentified flying object. The case was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation.
