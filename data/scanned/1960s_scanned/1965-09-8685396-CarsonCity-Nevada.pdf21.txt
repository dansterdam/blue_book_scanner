October 15, 1965
Mr. Richard Hall
Acting Director
National Investigations Committee
on Aerial Phenomena
1536 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20036

Dear Mr. Hall:

Your recent letter addressed to the Federal Aviation Agency's Public Relations Office in Washington has been referred to this office for response. This office was inadvertently placed with other material to be evaluated, and your request has apparently gone unnoticed for this reason.

The article enclosed with your letter from the St. Louis POST-DISPATCH, reported a recent weekend sighting of an unidentified flying object. I indicate that no UFOs were tracked by Federal Aviation Agency radar on the date and at the location mentioned in your letter.

The news article from the St. Louis POST-DISPATCH is returned.

Sincerely yours,

E. R. Jones
Public Affairs Officer
