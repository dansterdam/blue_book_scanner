The image provided does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STOP SUDDENLY AND CHANGE DIRECTION?
SPEED UP OR SLOW DOWN?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE IN SIZE?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
STILL IN A SPOT?
MANEUVER?
FLOAT, TIP OR WOBBLE?
IS WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

Carl G. Fuller, Jr. Motor

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

Faded

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
