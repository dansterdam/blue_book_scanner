Investigation of June 8, 1968

This report concerns a sighting reported by Mr. [redacted] (Route 1, Mosinee, Wisconsin); the event took place on Wednesday night, May 22, 1968, at 10:00 P.M.

At the inception, the witnesses present were Mr. [redacted], his wife [redacted], his son [redacted], and a friend of the son's, [redacted]. The principal witnesses (except for the others having been present, but being too frightened to make any useful observations.

The sighting began as the family had just gone to bed; the girls were in the beds (the younger pair sharing one bed, and [redacted] having the bed next to the window). They heard a sound getting louder and louder, and noticed that there was a light outside. At this point the shade covering the window was all the way down. [Redacted] pulled the shade aside and looked out the window, where she saw a very bright light just west of north. As she watched, it moved to the ground in the back yard. It was so bright, she said, that looking directly at it was painful. As she watched, too frightened to say anything, she could see the light coming closer. In order to get the light fast, she rushed to the left side of the window, but that seemed to lead to a line of sight passing just by the tree-trunk and over the fencepost marking the northwest corner of the back yard. An object in that direction would have been nearly at the level of the bedroom window.
