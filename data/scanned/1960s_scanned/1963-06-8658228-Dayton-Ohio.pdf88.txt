18-24 Jun 63
Andes Mts, Argentina

Between June 18 (Mendoza Area), a strange craft with red lights was sighted. It seemed to be hovering in the vicinity of the famous gigantic statue of Christ on the mountain. The object flew in a straight line, made some maneuvers and then disappeared behind the peaks at great speed. The party also saw strange flashes of light and there was much uneasy talk among the troops about flying unidentified objects. At one point, the area became blocked by very heavy snowfalls, it was impossible to communicate, and the party had to take shelter. It was some days before they could continue their mission. The incident corroborates other reports from the area that personnel of the Argentine and Chilean meteorological services have frequently observed mysterious moving lights. It would seem to confirm that this region of the Andes Mountains is a focal point of unidentified flying activity.
