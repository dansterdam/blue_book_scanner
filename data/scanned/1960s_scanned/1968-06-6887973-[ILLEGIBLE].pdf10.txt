There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text.

The text in the document is as follows:

DEPT (UFO)
UFO Observation and Photographs of June 1968

Mr. [REDACTED]
Physics and Engineering
Eastern Wyoming College
Torrington, Wyoming 82701

Reference: UFO observation and photographs of June 1968.
Usually the Air Force doesn't accept UFO sightings over 30 days old because old documentation such as balloon launch records and other normal aircraft flights are already destroyed. In this case I would like to handle this for you and I do accept the sighting as incoming observations and photography which are enclosed with AF Form 117 and Photo-Data Sheet and return them to this office. Any other information or narratives that you feel are pertinent, we will do our best to identify the sighting. Thank you for your cooperation and concern in this matter.

VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR. Lt. Colonel, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
