12. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT REFLECTED LIGHT OR WAS SELF-LUMINOUS AND WHAT COLORS YOU NOTICED. DESCRIBE YOUR IMPRESSION OF WHETHER IT APPEARED TO BE SOLID, SEMI-SOLID, VAPOR, ETC. AND OF ITS SIZE AND SPEED. RELATE IT TO FAMILIAR OBJECTS AND MEN IF POSSIBLE.
The object appeared as a luminous oval shape, banded, and changing in appearance. It seemed to float and glide slowly, with no sound detected. The object did not reflect light but appeared self-luminous, with a dim reddish glow. Its size appeared to be about the diameter of a basketball held at arm's length. The object's motion appeared controlled and purposeful, not erratic. It seemed to be an intelligently controlled craft, rather than a "natural" phenomenon.
