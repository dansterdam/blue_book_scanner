Transcribed text from the document:

"The incident took place about 9:00 PM, May 25, 1961 on NORTHHAVEN ROAD, DALLAS, TEXAS. I was returning home from work and had reached a point about half a mile north of the intersection of Northhaven and Preston Road when I observed a brilliant light in the northern sky. As I continued driving north, the light seemed to be moving in a southerly direction and descending rapidly. I pulled my car off the road and stopped to observe this object more closely. As it descended, the light became brighter and appeared to be in the shape of a flattened oval or ellipse. The object seemed to be metallic in appearance and was reflected in the color of the light it emitted. There was no sound associated with the object.

As the object continued to descend, it appeared to slow down and then hovered silently for approximately 30 seconds about 300 yards from where I was standing. The object then suddenly accelerated in a northerly direction and was out of sight in less than 10 seconds.

The entire incident lasted approximately 60 to 90 seconds. The weather at the time was clear with a bright moon and scattered clouds. There were no aircraft in the vicinity that I could see or hear."
