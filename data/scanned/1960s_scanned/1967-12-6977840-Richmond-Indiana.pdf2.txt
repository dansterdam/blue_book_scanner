The image contains a photograph that appears to be a sketch or drawing. The sketch shows a compass rose with the directions labeled, and below it there are two sketches depicting a person standing in a landscape view.

The text in the document reads as follows:

6A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "0" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE PHENOMENON LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "0" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "0" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. IF THE PHENOMENON HOVERED IN ONE SPOT, INDICATE SO BY WRITING 
"HOVERED" ACROSS THE LINE.
