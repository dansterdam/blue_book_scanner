COMBAT REPORT (RCS: JCS-C-3065)

The witness was a private citizen residing in the Murfreesboro, Tennessee, area. On the evening of 9 September 1963, at approximately 2030 hours, the witness was outside his home when he noticed a bright light or object in the sky to the north-northwest. The object was shaped like a mushroom and was giving off a brilliant white light. The object seemed to be hovering or floating in the sky, and the light given off by the object was so intense that it seemed to illuminate the surrounding countryside. After observing the object for several minutes, it suddenly shot off to the west at a very high rate of speed, nearly disappearing from view. The witness stated that the object's disappearance was very sudden and abrupt, and that it seemed to accelerate to an extremely high speed in the blink of an eye. Attempts to locate further information or witnesses to corroborate this report have been unsuccessful.
