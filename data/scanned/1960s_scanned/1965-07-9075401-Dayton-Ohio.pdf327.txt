NG CAZE (INFORMATION ONLY) 3 July 
San Antonio, Texas

PID (TYPED)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433
26 July 1952

Dear Hayden:

The following comments apply to the reported sighting by one of your NICAP correspondents on 26 July 1952 at 1700 hours, which you requested be considered as part of the official Air Force case file.

The duration of twenty-eight minutes was very confusing. The object(s) were described as round and square, which seemed logical from the general description, followed by an estimate that the object had vanished and reappeared in this sequence.

I have checked the ECHO schedule for San Antonio, Texas as of that date and observed no records indicating the sighting of any object. The reported stopping of the object which you mentioned with identifiable conditions or an illusion created by the passage of one or more cloud layers does not clarify the reported observations.

The only object with similar appearance to the satellite was the Moon, which at the time of the reported incident appears to have been the only celestial body in the area capable of being observed. The reported disappearance did not exceed ten minutes and the report does not support the concept of an unconventional aerial object.
