The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before? If so give date or dates and location.
I have seen several unidentified objects and other strange things several times and after the lights at Twinky Hutter of Alice, I think they were quite similar.

31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One)
Yes  No
31.1 IF you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One) 
Yes  No

31.2 Please list their names and addresses:
Livingston, Ohio

32. Please give the following information about yourself:
NAME: [REDACTED]
ADDRESS: [REDACTED]
TELEPHONE NUMBER: [REDACTED]
AGE: 30  SEX: Female
Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experiences, which might be pertinent.
I have seen quite a number of unidentified objects and things that I think are highly intelligent and I think any intelligent person would still be very mystified about such a common object at such a close distance.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? 
3/8   South Air Force Base, Washington, D.C. 1967
