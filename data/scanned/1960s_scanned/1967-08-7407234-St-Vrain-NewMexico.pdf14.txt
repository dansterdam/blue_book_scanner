The image contains a compass rose diagram and some handwritten text, but no photograph. Based on the instructions, I will not attempt to identify any humans in the image.

The text in the image reads:

27. In the direction that the object or objects moved, place a "B" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

WE SAW TWO OBJECTS STARTING FROM ALMOST THE SAME POINT MOVING A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AND THEN THEY STARTED MOVING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND FROM TOP TO BOTTOM MOVING AT VERY RAPID SPEED THAT THEY BECAME INVISIBLE JUST AS QUICK AS THEY APPEARED FROM THE SAME POINT AS IF THEY WERE SOME KIND OF MECHANICAL DEVICE THAT FLEW IN FORMATION ALMOST LIKE THEY WERE ON A CABLE OR ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER IN SOME WAY.
