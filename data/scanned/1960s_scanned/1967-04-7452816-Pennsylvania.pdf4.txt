April 20, 1967
Dear Colonel Manale,
This morning's reply report to you of April 16, 1967, concerning my sighting of an apparent air craft, or an object unknown to myself, which I attempted to inform you of before. It disregards major facts which are of significant importance concerning this craft.

The craft observed on edge, and then 24 minutes later was again observed as a bright star-like object transiting slowly through uniform vapor or hazy somewhat brownish cloud layers. It showed no detail, or outline of any kind, but appeared as a brilliant star-like light source.

Its course was substantially level though its speed varied considerably. Occasionally dark linear masses were moving rapidly toward or away from the object, indicating dynamic forces at work apparently in the object itself.

I propose through this supplementary report to correct the failure of the previous report to adequately cover all significant observations of what in the light of this further information I believe was an unconventional craft of some kind.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
