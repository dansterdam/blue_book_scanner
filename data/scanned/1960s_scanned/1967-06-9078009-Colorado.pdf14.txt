The image contains a sketch or drawing made by the observer, but no photograph is present.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   No   Don't Know.  If you answered YES, then tell what:
"It seemed to go behind some clouds and then reappear."

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   No   Don't Know.  If you answered YES, then tell what:
"It seemed to go in front of some clouds and then reappear."

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color white - clear white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
1 degree C

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[A sketch is included showing a roughly circular or elliptical object with a curved arrow indicating its direction of movement.]
