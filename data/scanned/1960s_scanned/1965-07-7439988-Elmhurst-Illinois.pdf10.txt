Dumfries, England

The little north-eastern wave got
away with an incident on 12th.
July of which few people seem to
know, but they are not known to us at
time.

On DATING, which has a certain
amount of mystery, the evening of
July 30, went to see the Rev.
R. R. Thompson, Vicarage, Dumfries,
Scotland, and three of his
friends, saw a bright blue blur in the
north-western sky going past towards
the south, south-west, but it
disappeared behind the trees. This
occurred about 10.15 p.m. and
the thing was silent. Traveling across
the sky, not unlike a shooting star,
but slower. This sighting is due to
those concerned.
