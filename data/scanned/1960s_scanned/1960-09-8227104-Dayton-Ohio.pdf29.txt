The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire with text and redacted personal information.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object?
(Circle One)    Yes      No
If you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate? Speed of a bullet

Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was?
(Circle One)     Yes     No  
If you answered YES, then how far away would you say it was? Couple or 3 miles

Please give the following information about yourself:
NAME: [Redacted]
ADDRESS: [Redacted]

TELEPHONE NUMBER: [Redacted]
AGE: 46
Sex: F

Please indicate any additional information about yourself, including any education, which might be pertinent.

[The questionnaire is completed.]
