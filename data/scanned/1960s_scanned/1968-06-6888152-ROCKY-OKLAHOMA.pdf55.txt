Operator: Can you tell me how he came to the phone?
Answer: He is here.
Operator: Can we talk to him? Long distance calling. Is this Brent?
Yes.
Operator: Go ahead, please.
Hynek: Hello, this is Prof. Hynek at Northwestern University. Did you get my letter?
Yes.
Hynek: Fine. He's not down here any more. He's in college.
As I said in the letter, I am very much interested in your sighting and I wonder if you could answer a few questions about it?
I'll try.
Hynek: Which one are you, the younger or the older?
I'm the younger. Jerry is not here because he is in college.
Hynek: Is he your cousin?
Yes, he is my cousin.
Hynek: Where is he in college?
In Western Oklahoma.
Hynek: Well, okay then. As long as I've got you on the line I might as well talk with you and I can call Jerry later. This all happened on June 19, 1968, is that right? So it is not too far back. What first called your attention to it?
It sounded like a helicopter at first. I guess that is why I looked up at first. So why don't we just do it this way. You take a deep breath and let's go over the whole thing again and just describe what happened.
Hynek: Well, when I first looked up there I saw it all lit up. There was noise there but then I heard the noise quit. How bright was it?
