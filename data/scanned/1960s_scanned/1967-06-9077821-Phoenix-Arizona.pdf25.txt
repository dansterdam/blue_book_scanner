UNCLASSIFIED (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/shs/3 May 63
UFO OBSERVATION, 17 June 1967

Dr. J. Allen Hynek

Reference your letter of 23 February 1963 with regards to
observation of 17 June 1967. This relates to a report submitted
on a sighting that was telephoned to this office by
observers. You may certainly do so if you feel
it is not necessary.

As you may know, a good copy of the investigating report
has been obtained and forwarded to the technical library
records center. It appears to have been made from an excellent
negative and the color and details are quite clear. It will
not be necessary for me to obtain another copy since the one on
file appears to be a copy of what I would consider a satisfactory
original.

VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR. Lt Colonel, USAF
Vice Director, Production Directorate
