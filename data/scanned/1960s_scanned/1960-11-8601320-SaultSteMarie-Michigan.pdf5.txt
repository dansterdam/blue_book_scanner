THIS OBJECT WAS SEEN BY TWO PERSONS AT THE SAME TIME (ONLY
ONE INTERVIEWED) THE INITIAL REPORT WAS CALLED IN ONLY A FEW
MINUTES AFTER THE SIGHTING TOOK PLACE, THE DELAY IN COMPILING
THIS REPORT IS DUE TO A MIX-UP IN OBSERVER'S PHONE NUMBER AND I.D.
LIABIIITY OF THIS OFFICER TO REACH SITE AND DETERMINE THE INITIAL CALL-IN
DETAIL MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED DUE TO ATTEMPT TO WATCH HICK'S  IT IS
FELT THAT AN ACTUAL SIGHTING TOOK PLACE.  THIS REPORTING OFFICER
QUESTIONED THE OBSERVER AT LENGTH AND HIS ANSWERS WERE ALL CLEAR
AND DEFINITE AND CONTAINED NO CONTRADICTIONS OR HYSTERIA. 
IF THE WEATHER BALLOON LAUNCHED AT LISHAME ND WAS STILL AIRBORNE
AT 22:32 24 NOV 60 WHICH IS 23:32 AFTER THE LAUNCHING TOOK PLACE
IT SEEM LIKELY THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN WHAT THE OBSERVER SIGHTED.  
THE -76 -,/-CTION AND APPARENT STOPPING COULD HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED
TO CHA.-.7E EFFECT OF A TEMPERATURE INVERSION CAUSING THE OPTICAL
ILLUSION OF 2'16-2I6.A STRAIGHTLINE DISTANCE FROM DISNEY TO
LISHAME ND WAS STILL AIRBORNE.
