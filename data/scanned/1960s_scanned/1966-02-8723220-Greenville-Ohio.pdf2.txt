The image shared does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document.

Text from the document:

"It would be wonderful to see a long silver bar, couldn't this have been an experiment and was carefully examined and measured all in the way it was photographed by means of someone's camera, as this looked very strange. 
I was so much disappointed that I could not get a better look or watch it closely as it was gone by the time I got outside. There was so much distraction that I have told your friends my story and many thanks for it finding out. Henderson your so much for reading why it is."
