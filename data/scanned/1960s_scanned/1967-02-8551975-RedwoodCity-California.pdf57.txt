UFO passed in front of _NA_ac_NA_ cf/mt - passed behind _NA_at _NA_ 
The witness was proceeding NB on Route 133 Andover when his attention was attracted to an unusual lighted object in the sky. The witness stopped on Route 133 and parked his car. The witness called the local police station to report his observation. The police advised him it was probably a plane, but the witness insisted on reporting it. The witness observed the object for about 15 minutes and then it disappeared. He had called one "Laurence Earle Moline" to witness the observation. The object was seen to pass in front of and then behind a static object, believed to be a power line tower. No colored lights were observed, only a brilliant white light or object.

REMARKS:
Concerning things to note are: 1) The absence of "person" lights or a conventional body, 2) The lights were steady, not blinking, 3) The maneuvers which carried it over a power line tower. The case is interesting because the witness, who was a merchant, claimed to have seen many unusual things in the sky for which he had no explanations.
