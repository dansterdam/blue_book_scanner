The shared image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with text describing observations of a "strange object" that emitted a "brilliant and gave off 'strange-looking blue'", and then fell into the Peropsava River.

Here is the text found in the document:

(continued from Page 7) 
very brilliant and gave off "strange-looking blue", This object, which gave off a "pulsing motion", was first observed at 9:25 p.m. and the object was seen by the
captain and crew of the barge. Within 15 to 20 minutes after the object appeared, it fell into the Peropsava River.
