MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO OBSERVATION, 3 March 1963
Butler State Police had one report from:
TIME: 9:50 pm
OBJECT: Five lights, sparks, four small behind, one ahead.
Spoke with Mrs. [REDACTED], who also observed the objects. They were in a car at the time, traveling on route 38. Mrs. [REDACTED] said the object was to the north of them, not to the south. Object pretty high in the sky, 60 - 75 deg elevation. Didn't hear any sound. Balls of fire just seemed to disintegrate, faded out before they got to the horizon, kind of like fireworks, around 75 degree elevation when it disappeared. She didn't know of anyone else who observed the objects.
