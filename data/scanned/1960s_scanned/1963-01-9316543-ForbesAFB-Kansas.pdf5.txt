H. REMARKS: LIEUTENANT LAMBERT RECALLED SEEING SIMILAR PHENOMENON ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO, BUT DID NOT REPORT IT AT THAT TIME. AIRMAN AIRMAN SAID HE THOUGHT ITEM MIGHT BE RETURNING LIGHT WHICH WAS WHY HE HAD REPORTED IT, BUT NONE SUCH HAS BEEN REPORTED ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION THAT THE UNDERSIGNED CAN THINK OF THAT IT WAS THE REFLECTION OF A COLORED SEARCHLIGHT OFF THE FOG. LIEUTENANT LAMBERT'S SIGHTING WAS MADE IN NOVEMBER 1961 ON A MORNING, ABOUT DAWN, HOWEVER.
