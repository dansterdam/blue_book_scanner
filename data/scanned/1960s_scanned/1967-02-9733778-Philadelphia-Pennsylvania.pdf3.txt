There is no photograph present in the image provided. The image appears to be a handwritten document, likely a Project Blue Book UFO report.

A partial OCR of the text in the document is as follows:

"A triangular object with a white light at the edge of an object and slowly moved across the sky."
"Projectile glow spotted when about to disappear moving in a straight direction at a rapid rate and climbed at a steep angle very rapidly then disappeared."
"The object was observed in the sky for approximately 1-1/2 minutes over Monument Road, Derry, Clark called."
