35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

While this object appeared to be a star at first, it was no ordinary star because of the strange direction of movement. Also it was quite different in appearance, seeming to go faster at times than others and then disappearing while still in the same area. It didn't across the sky as a shooting star. It seemed to be hovering at different speeds and in different spots high in the sky. There appeared to be a strange lighted effect or aura around it as well.
