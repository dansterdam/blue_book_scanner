The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document.

BOONE, MASS â€“ 10/7/68
"Its presence by abscess itself off "like a turning light scene.
The aircraft kept on its course and did not deviate after the object
was sighted. It turned, however, classified object to light on ground. Examination of witness and comparison with similar reports upon the sketch of the witness and of confidence and feeling its reality, convinced me of the witness and comparison with similar reports."
My own impression of the witness, although based only on a telephone conversation, was that the story was within the credibility factor. I have included the sketch of the witness.
(Two other reports originated from this area the following week. One involved a large dark object which acceleratedly disappeared. The other sighting was another nearly morning, shiny object another light on the roadside, no effort was made to investigate on part of NICAP HASS Subcom. The NICAP service and police reported reports of sightings on 19 October 1968 per Report #68-57 is one-witness report by an undersized and elderly person. It is felt that the possibility that the USAF received other reports that the aircraft may have been officially investigated, etc. If such were the case, this report could be of value as supplementary evidence.)
