Dear Sir:

I have an interesting sighting to report to you. On March 31, 1966 at approx. 6:00 P.M. I went outside to observe the sunset. As I viewed the sky, I saw a bright stationary object like the more significant stars. This object was observed for about 20 minutes. It did not move at all and was approximately in the West. It appeared to be elongated in shape and did not give the impression of being a star. The more significant and significant object just sat there. 

There appeared to be no sound or tail as is associated with a missile or jet. The object was silvery or metallic in appearance. This is the first time I have observed such an object.

Yours truly,
Guntersville, Ala.
