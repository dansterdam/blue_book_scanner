September 28, 1965

Dear Mr. Hall:

The report you mention of sightings from 1965 near Bunkie, Louisiana has been received and we appreciate your sending it to us. While we have been reporting and more of them identified,, NICAP still has a great many reports in their files that remain unidentified. Many of the sightings we receive do contain interesting data but we will be unable to make any identifications from the descriptions alone without adequate photographic evidence. If your witnesses are able to provide photographs of the objects observed, we will be glad to examine them. Please inform me if any such photographs are available.

Yours truly,
L. J. Lorenzen
Associate Director
