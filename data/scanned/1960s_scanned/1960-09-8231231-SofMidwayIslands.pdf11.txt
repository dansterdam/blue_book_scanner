ATIC, 4-AP 
FITS THAT OF THE CHARACTERISTIC FIREBALL, EVEN TO THE RELATIVELY 
SLOW VELOCITY. FIREBALLS ARE CHARACTERISTICALLY SLOWER THAN THE
ORDINARY METEOR AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF THOSE SEEN IN THE
EARLY EVENING, THE TIME THIS SIGHTING OCCURRED. 
ON 26 SEP 60, AT 0700Z AND POSITION 21-52N, 179-25W, AN UFO WAS
OBSERVED BY THE CREW OF A MILITARY AIRCRAFT. THE OBJ WAS RAPID AS
ROUND OR OVAL IN SHAPE, SIX INCHES IN DIAMETER AT ARM'S LENGTH AND 
CONTINUALLY CHANGING FROM RED TO GREEN TO WHITE AND REPEATING THE
CYCLE. EACH COLOR WOULD PERSIST FOR THREE TO FOUR SECONDS BEFORE
CHANGING TO THE NEXT. THE LIGHT FROM THE OBJ WAS USED TO BE VERY
BRIGHT. ONLY ONE OBJ WAS RPID, BUT IT WAS OBSERVED SEVERAL TIMES.
THE OBJ LEFT NO TAIL OR TRAIL AND MADE NO SOUND WHICH COULD BE 
DETECTED BY THE WITNESSES. WHEN THE OBJ WAS FIRST SIGHTED THE
MISSION AIRCRAFT WAS IN A LEFT TURN. THE OBJ APPEARED TO CLIMB
FROM WATER LEVEL AT THE EIGHT O'CLOCK POSITION, SPEED PAST THE 
TAIL OF THE HPTO AIRCRAFT TO THE FIVE O'CLOCK POSITION WHERE IT WAS
LOST FROM VIEW. WHEN NEXT THE OBJ WAS SEEN THE MISSION AIRCRAFT 
WAS LEVEL AT 15,000' ON A COURSE OF 210 DEGREES. THE OBJ WAS
SIGHTED AT SIXTY DEGREES RELATIVE BEARING AT 10 DEGREES ELEVATION
AND MOVING ACROSS THE NOSE TO A RELATIVE BEARING OF 330 DEGREES
LOW. THE OBJ DISAPPEARED BEHIND A CLOUD BANK WITH TOPS AT 10,000'.
THE OBJ WAS OBSERVED FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR MINUTES. THIS RPT ARRIVED
AT ATIC ON 27 SEP 60, AND HAS NOT AS YET BEEN ANALYZED DUE TO THE
ABSENCE OF ESSENTIAL DATA WHICH HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY 'DATA'. IN
VIEW OF THE INFO WHICH IS AVAILABLE, THIS OBJ COULD POSSIBLY HAVE
