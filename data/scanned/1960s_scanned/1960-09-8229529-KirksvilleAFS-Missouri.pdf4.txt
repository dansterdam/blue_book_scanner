EVALUATION OF UFO (U)

1. Reference your memos dtd 21 Sep 60 and 29 Sep 60.

2. ALL BLIPS AND LIGHTING OBSERVED ON RADAR STATION AND RANGE STATION WERE NOTED ON THE SAME RADAR EQUIPMENT. THIS EQUIPMENT IS QUITE POWERFUL AND SENSITIVE DETECTION INSTRUMENTATION.

3. TARGETS OBSERVED WERE STATIONARY, THEN EXHIBITED RAPID ACCELERATION AND HIGH SPEED BEFORE DISAPPEARANCE. ALONG WITH THE EXTREMELY RAPID MANEUVERABILITY, THIS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNUSUAL NATURE OF THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGETS WHICH WERE REPORTED.

4. IN NO INSTANCE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS OR MOTION PICTURES OBTAINED SINCE THE OBSERVATIONS WERE OF SUCH SHORT DURATION AND THE OBJECTS MOVED WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT CAMERA COULD NOT BE AIMED AND OPERATED IN TIME TO RECORD THE TARGETS.
