The text reads as follows:

One of times turning on and off at 4:47 am. These objects were are in the taking of north-north-east. I saw is now seen again it is all an 9 have more with something but I know what I saw. But I know what I mean "it" is all in 9 have more other all might solve. I wish only that you to consider and to make right.

I think there is a logical explanation at the the 9 is prominent is signed and I do not know. I do not wish to become too many and we have report 9-9-65 earlier.

Sincerely,
