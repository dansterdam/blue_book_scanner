The image appears to contain a photograph of an unidentified object over the northern hemisphere. The photograph is accompanied by text describing the observations made regarding the object.

The text reads:

The camera's aperture appeared elongated on Nevember 28th (1955) and measured 1/2 mile when pointed North, and 1/4 mile when pointed South. The two assistants, C. F. Mapes and J. Young used the 5-inch telescope 1/2 mile away.

In the case of Comet 1862 III, spectrographic observations were made using qualitative methods and detailed analytical results were published in the February, 1960 Sky and Telescope, page 204.

Through professional astronomical organizations, correspondence was extensive. Senior astronomers provided a very welcome appreciation to observers' skill, especially of the photographic work on comets, meteors, and novae in the early 1950s.

In 1952, when spectrographic techniques and interpretations were both very primitive, most comets also show a pronounced continuous spectrum, with superimposed absorption lines.

Photographic observations of cometary spectra began showing far more detail of emission lines and absorption features due to molecules and atomic elements like CH, CN, CII, and the CO+ ion. These lines for carbon and oxygen near 5800 and 5800 Angstrom were observed in comets, and their emission intensities provided information about the conditions within the comets and at the sun.

The aperture was 18 inches, the first spectra obtained through it were those of Comet Arend-Roland in 1956, analyzed by Ralph Copeland and J.G. Baker.
