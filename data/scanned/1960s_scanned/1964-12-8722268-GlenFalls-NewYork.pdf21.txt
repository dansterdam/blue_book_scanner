RENDEVOUS OVER BEREA

Berea, Ohio - December 8, 1964 - 9:20 P.M. EST

A businessman, who wishes to remain anonymous, called the Berea Police Department to report a strange sighting in the sky. These are the details as he gave them:

(David Nelson) was walking behind his backyard. He spotted a bright object in the sky, which he later described as a "rendezous" of four separate objects.

His calls brought his mother outdoors to see the sighting. At first they both observed the objects "hovering". Then they began to move about, separating and rejoining in what appeared to be a coordinated fashion. After a few minutes (5-7), the lights switched off and the objects disappeared. After a few seconds (.5?), the lights were again visible, continuing their strange manuvering.

David Nelson and his mother both concurred that at one point, the lights seemed to be arranged in a definite (but clear) outline. The smaller white singular objects were moving in and out of this formation, at times disappearing altogether.

There were no sound effects heard from the three objects, according to the witness.

The duration of the sighting was estimated to be about 15 minutes. It started thinking on and off, and the objects appeared to move about erratically, some 10-15 degrees in direction.

Just a few minutes later when they saw a large red light near the horizon, it was headed straight down toward the ground. It stopped suddenly about 5 feet off the ground, then shut off, and finally drifted to the ground. There was no evidence of a crash. 

At the same time, the original sighting of about 15 degrees of arc started blinking on and off, and then appeared to move off behind some trees. That was the end of the sighting according to the witness.
