The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this image, only a filled-out questionnaire form with handwritten responses.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It seems to have disappeared  behind some clouds or smoke.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes  No  Don't Know.   If you answered 'Yes', describe the movement:
It moved behind a cloud

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes  No  Don't Know.   If you answered 'Yes', describe the movement:
In front of a cloud

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound ....a swishing, whistling sound
b. Color ....a bright clear white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? I cannot say that as the object would have been covered by the match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include any of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
