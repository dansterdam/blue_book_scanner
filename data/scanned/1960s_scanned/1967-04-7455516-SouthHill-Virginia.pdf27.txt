TESTS

Two tests were performed by the investigator with the aid of Sgt. Barnes. The first involved making a crude impact tester (see diagram) for the purpose of seeing how easily a 1/2-inch hole could be made in the road surface (tarred gravel).

The impact tester consisted of a weight mounted on the end of a board, the other end of which was hinged to a smaller double thickness of board on which a person could stand to hold the apparatus steady. Just beyond the weight a 1/2-inch bolt was fastened through the board, protruding slightly.
