GIRL SAYS SHE WAS BURNED 
WHILE WATCHING UFO HERE
A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL SAID TODAY THAT WHILE WATCHING A STRANGE OB- JECT IN THE SKY OVER HER HOME HERE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON SHE WAS BURNED BY INTENSE HEAT.
SHARON STULL, DAUGHTER OF MR. AND MRS. L. C. STULL OF 1804 WINDSOR DR., SAID SHE WAS STANDING IN THE YARD OF HER HOME WHEN SHE SAW THE OBJECT HOVERING OVER HER HOME.
MRS. STULL SAID THAT ABOUT FOUR MINUTES AFTER SHARON FIRST OB-SERVED THE OBJECT IT DISAPPEARED. SHARON'S DOCTOR SAID HER EYES AND FACE, BOTH EYES AND NECK, WERE REDDENED, INDICATING SLIGHT SUNBURN.
SHARON SAID THAT WHILE SHE WAS WATCHING THE OBJECT, WHICH SHE DESCRIBED AS EGG-SHAPED, THERE SUDDENLY WAS A "FLASH OF LIGHT" AND SHE FELT INTENSE HEAT ON HER FACE, NECK AND HANDS. SHE SAID SHE HAD TO TURN AWAY FOR A FEW SECONDS BECAUSE OF THE BRIGHTNESS.
SHARON SAID SHE IS UNABLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT CAUSED THE LIGHT OR THE HEATING EFFECT. SHE SAID SHE COULD SEE NO EXHAUST OR FLAME FROM THE OBJECT AND IT MADE NO NOISE. 
THE WEATHER BUREAU SAID THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND SUNNY IN THE AREA AT THE TIME.
OFFICIALS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AIR FORCE'S PROJECT "BLUE BOOK," WHICH INVESTIGATES UFO REPORTS, SAID THEY WERE AWARE OF THE INCIDENT AND WERE CHECKING INTO IT.
