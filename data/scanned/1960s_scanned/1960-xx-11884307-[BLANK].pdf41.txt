LOS ANGELES, April 12 - The Air Force has announced that the 'flying saucers' depicted in a motion picture being released next month were actually photographed by the Air Force during a flying saucer incident over the Southwest on Septemsber 9, 1952.

The film, titled "UFOs Nent", has been described as a documentary-type picture designed to inform the public about the Governments investigations of unidentified flying objects. It was produced by Robert Emenegger, a Las Vegas businessman, and the technical director was Marc Rommel, an Aerospace analyst who has worked on Government contracts.

The Air Force has granted permission for the release of the film, which contains some of the first authenticated motion picture evidence of 'flying saucers,' the Defense Department said. The sightings occurred in the Southwest, but the exact location was not divulged by the Air Force.

The film, which is reported to run for about an hour, was produced through an independent company and received no Government subsidy, Mr. Emenegger said. He described it as a 'serious treatment' of the 'flying saucer' phenomenon and said that the film was not 'sensational' in nature.
