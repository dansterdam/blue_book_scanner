Dear Mrs. _____ 
The Air Force does not disregard any reports officially submitted to them for evaluation. The phenomena which you observed in your letter of Aug 9, 1965 does not come within the limits of the identification classification the Air Force could have made at this late date. It is not feasible to attempt an investigation toward an identification of the object or objects involved.

Regarding the articles from the Philadelphia Inquirer which you mentioned in your letter, a copy of an AF release stating the cause for the stoppage of electromagnetic clocks is attached.

The balloon observed over Portugal and the Azores was probably a weather balloon released by India.

The phenomena observed in the Atlantic was a possible meteor, as described in the article, and the observations in Chile - these observations have not been officially reported to the United States Air Force.

The alleged incident in the article was not reported to the Air Force.

The attached report on Project Blue Book represents the Air Force's position on the UFO program to date.

Sincerely, 

[Signature and stamp]
