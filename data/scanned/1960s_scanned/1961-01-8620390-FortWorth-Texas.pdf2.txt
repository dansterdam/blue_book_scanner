13 January 1961

TO: ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. There have been sightings of UFOs in the vicinity of Sheppard AFB, Texas, on 5 January 1961. Six of these sightings were related.

2. An investigation on 9 January was made by Major WALTER R. ALLEN and Major Donald F. Taylor, as they proceeded from the Chanute AFB, Illinois to Sheppard AFB. During the course of this investigation, it was determined that the object in question appears to be sound. No other sightings or incidents were reported.

3. Witness statements and many rounds of ground sightings during the night of 5 January 1961 indicated that the object was in the airspace (see Attachs. 1 and 2) at 2150 hours and 2155 hours for a period of approximately 10 minutes each time. The object was described as round, about 50 feet in diameter, and fluorescent in appearance. The object hovered and maneuvered at an unspecified altitude. Only the description was considered, as no other criteria or qualitative data was indicated.

4. The 13 January sighting was reported by Mrs. _____'s judgment and reliability were questionable. It was determined that this previous report (see Attach. #3) and the description of the object indicated that it was "larger" and she described it as a "cigar-shaped". It was further determined that the object observed on 5 January 1961 was probably an optical illusion, or that Mrs. _____ was mistaken in her observation.

5. Mr. _____ reported that he is a programmer and weatherman for KFDX-TV, Wichita Falls, Texas, and he made an estimate of the object as it flew over his home in Iowa Park, Texas on 5 January 1961.
