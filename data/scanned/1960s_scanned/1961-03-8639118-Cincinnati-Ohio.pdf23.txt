REPLY TO OD-S
SUBJECT: Request for Information

TO: SAFOI-30 (Major Coleman)

1. Attached is a copy of a letter from Mr. reporting the sightings of a UFO, and requesting information on same.

2. PTD files indicate that the same object observed by Mr. was also observed at Breckinridge, Ohio. The time, descriptions and flight paths in all cases were the same, bearing out this continuation. The fact that the same object observed over a wide area over several hours indicates the very unusual nature of the PTD conclusion is that the object was a fireball, one of three types.
