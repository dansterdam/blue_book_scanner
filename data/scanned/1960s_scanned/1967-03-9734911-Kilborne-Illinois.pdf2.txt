The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, likely an interview or questionnaire form.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 11 Day 6 Month 1967 Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

For the past 2 years, I have seen an unusual flying craft hovering at low altitude in the northwestern part of Kilborne, Illinois. The craft is round or disc-shaped, approximately 50 feet in diameter, and has a dull metallic surface. It makes no sound and moves with no visible means of propulsion. The sightings have occurred on several occasions, usually on clear, moonlit nights between 10 PM and 2 AM. The craft appears to hover silently for 5-10 minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight. I have not reported these incidents previously as I was unsure of their significance and did not wish to be ridiculed. However, I feel the sightings may be of interest to your investigators and would be willing to provide additional details if requested.
