Yes it is. I know Mr. Fuller quite well, and his Incident at Exeter which I think you should read is available in paper back, describes an experience rather similar to yours. It's called Incident at Exeter.
Yes, I saw this, I believe, on the cover sheet of this other book.
Yes, if you can pick that up at the library or in a paperback, I suggest you read it.
HAS this account in Interrupted Journey, has this been more or less completely substantiated?
Well, it's substantiated as a hard thing to say; it's been substantiated in the effect that no one thinks these people were liars, or hoaxters, but there just is no explanation.
Right. It is one of the unexplained, then.
Yes. We'd have to have more reports like it and see what patterns there are, what similarities there are. This is why I'm tracking down these cases in which cars stopped, because we have enough of those cases now to try to put the pieces together. Well, I tell you what Mr. Jones, it's been very enjoyable talking to you, and I think that you and I will keep in touch ..
I'm sure we'll will. I'll be most happy to possibly talk to the over this weekend.
Well, this would be fine. Please do send me the account, and let's try to get as much out of this case .. I think this case can be of considerable value to science, so let's keep digging at it, and if you come up with any recollections of additional things, that you, that come to mind that somehow slipped, please let me know.
Let me put your address down here in case my wife didn't keep it when she didn't.
