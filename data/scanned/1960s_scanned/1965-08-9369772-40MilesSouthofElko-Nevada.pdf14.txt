35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: Felt didn't have a good idea as to our position, as we were on a radar detector and United Airlines flight 4136 was observed about 75 cents South of our heading. Our heading was 500, altitude 33000', the object appeared at about 10 o'clock position and moved to a 3 o'clock position. It moved in a horizontal plane - didn't seem to gain or lose altitude. It has been almost a month since sighting it - believe that all pilots from United Airlines flight at that time have gone to serve in Viet Nam and a lot more accurate report could be given.
