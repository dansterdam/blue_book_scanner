34. Date you completed this questionnaire: _2_5_ _3_ _6_4_
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questioned or a narrative explanation of your sighting: 
I saw a bright light over to the wets, quite high up, like a st eak of light, moving quite slowly from south to north. It appeared to be rectangular in shape and seemed slightly darker than the surroundings, perhaps metallic. After watching it for several minutes it suddenly seemed to streak away at a tremendous speed, disappearing in a few seconds. The objects appearance and behaviour were unusual and quite different from any conventional aircraft I have seen.
I reported this incident to the Newtown Police, but they were unable to offer any explanation. One person told me they had seen a similar object about the same time. 
I would be interested to know if there were any other reports of a similar siting in this area at about the same time. Please let me know.
