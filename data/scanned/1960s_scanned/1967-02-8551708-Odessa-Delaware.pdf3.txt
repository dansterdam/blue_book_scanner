NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
CORRESPONDENCE

To: 	Ann V Lockerby

From: 	C A Chinn

Date: 	4/17-1967

Unidentified but good sightings on the basis of information given. On the question of reliability, there is some indication of this person having a background of scientific interest and some training in observation, so that he may be reasonably reliable. The descriptions given, while not extremely detailed, seem plausible and the observations appear to have been made with some care.
