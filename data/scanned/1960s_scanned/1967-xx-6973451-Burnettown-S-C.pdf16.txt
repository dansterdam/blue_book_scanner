The image contains two illustrations. The larger one shows a compass-like diagram with directional labels. The smaller ones depict landscape scenes, with a person standing in the distance. There is also some text on the page, which I will now attempt to transcribe:

4A. Now imagine you are at the center of the compass rose. Place an x on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when last seen. A dot on the compass indicates the direction to which the compass is pointing - 
INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND AN O AT THE POSITION WHEN LAST SEEN. AS THE PHENOMENON MOVED, DRAW THE PATH IT TOOK. MAKE THE APPEARANCE TO ME STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.  REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS LARGER SKETCH.
