Reference the balloon which was recovered at Vero Beach, Florida. This balloon was probably manufactured by the G. T. Schjeldahl Company, Northfield, Minnesota. This particular balloon was probably launched from Cape Kennedy prior to the Gemini 6 mission. The Schjeldahl Company has supplied approximately 1,500 of these 500,000 cubic foot balloons to the Aerospace Space Center for space missions. Information on temperature, pressure, and density of the atmosphere prior to launch. As long as these balloons are launched as frequently as every five minutes during the last hour of the countdown, they provide data on wind direction and velocity. Past data on these balloons would probably end up over the water due to the prevailing winds.
