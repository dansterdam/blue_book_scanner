1. The attached color slide, taken by a Canadian tourist while the United States was investigating an ATIC object which was sighted on 1 June 1960, and is reported to show an unidentified flying object which the witness also saw.

Utilizing the information and the data from the slide, the following details regarding the witness' photographic equipment, the photographic exposure, and the object observed are furnished:

a. The estimate of the elevation (45Â°) of the object as reported by the witness is far out of line. The average elevation is much lower.

b. The witness reported that the shutter speed setting for this picture was 1/500. This means the object traveled a considerable distance while the picture was taken. At a distance of 7,200,000 nautical miles per second, 1/500 of a second, the object would have traveled approximately 14,400 feet. If such an object were to be seen all, it would appear as a linear streak approximately 1400 feet per second. If such an object were to be seen at all, it would appear as a linear streak.

c. Utilizing the speeds for 10 nautical miles distance and average of the 1-3 seconds during which the witness reported the object was in view, this object would then have traveled approximately 14,000 nautical miles.

d. The slide gives indication that the camera was not pointed directly at the object as would be expected under the circumstances, but was with the horizon.
