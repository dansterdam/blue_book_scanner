There is no photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a filled out form from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE? 
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE? 
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
HAVE ANY SOUND?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?

WHAT DID YOU ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

RAS JUST PASSED BRIGHT
LIGHT IN THE SKY.

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

MOSTLY DISAPPEARED OUT OF SIGHT.

DOES THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? 

JUST PASSED THIS RADIO TOWER.
