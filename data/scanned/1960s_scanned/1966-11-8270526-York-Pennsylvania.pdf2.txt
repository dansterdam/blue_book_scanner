35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or is necessary explanation of your sighting:

Several years ago I seen or noticed what appeared to be a round object hovering about 100 to 150 feet above the ground, did not make a sound and could not rotate it could not rotate it over, or any kind of it, and the object was perfectly round and white and looked like it was made of metal. I was alone at the time and there was no one else there to see it. This was about 11 PM at night and everything was dark all around, and this object just hovered there silently for about 5 minutes and then just took off like a shot and was gone in a matter of seconds. I could not figure out what it was or where it came from.
