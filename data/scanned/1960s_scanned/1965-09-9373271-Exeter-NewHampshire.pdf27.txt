silence of the thing."
Further confirmation came from the testimony of Mrs. Clyde Lever, whose home the Muscarello sighting was made. She told how, on September 2nd, between 9:30 and 10 p.m., she watched a brilliant light cross the sky over her home and at a distance. This was about four hours previous to the sighting by the police in the same area.
Also, shortly before Muscarello's arrival at the Exeter police station, a phone call by SAUCER WATCH to the Air Force UFO spokesman had revealed that the sighting by the two policemen is UNKNOWN.
Officer Bertrand talked to led woman parked in an automobile just prior to the arrival of the police and asked her if they needed help. Jr told him that, as she was driving from nearby Epping, U.S.., she did circle her car, giving off a brilliant red glow. She went on to say that it dived at her car several times before departing. Unfortunately, the woman did not take the names of these women, so they cannot be reached as additional evidence to the already impressive file we now have on the case.
The two police officers and several other people were greeted by Force officers from Pease Air Force Base. The policemen were told to turn the incident from the press, so as to "avoid alarming the local public" was too late, as several reporters already had the story. Then later, that an Air Force officer went to stores selling the Manchester Leader - containing the story - and bought up all the copies, of course denied.
A phone call by SAUCER WATCH to the Air Force UFO spokesman had revealed that the sighting by the two policemen is classified as an UNKNOWN.
