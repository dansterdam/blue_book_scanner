March 24, 1964

Dear Children:

Thank you for your letter of March 18, 1964, which you reported seeing an Unidentified Flying Object, and enclosed a very fine drawing of one like that you observed.

Mr. George Adamski's books are classed as science fiction. The writings he and other adventure stores you may have read in school are just yarns of Cosmic Housand Leagues under the Sea type. Under present day conditions, they are exciting to read, but they are not necessarily valid accounts of experiences by the author.

The Air Force has investigated over 8,000 case reports of Unidentified Flying Objects during the past 15 years, and has never found one bit of evidence that these objects are any type of spacecraft from another planet. In almost every instance the reports have been of familiar objects under unusual circumstances, and therefore was not unusual at all. Sometimes experimental balloons high up give a most unusual appearance. Airplanes flying shiny white chests that reflect the sunlight or objects light from a city have sometimes baffled observers, but they are also phenomena such as meteors, comets, fireballs, like what you kids saw, are really startling the imagination even on a dark night. Airplane pilots have been known to report Unidentified Flying Objects which turned out to be more conventional objects distorted by Atmospheric conditions may account for an object be observed and appearing as something else. There are a number of situations which might arise where you may tell what you think you see, but simply could not recognize.
