SOUTHERN RHODESIA
From the Salisbury Rhodesia Herald, June 2 -
"What was the mystery 'ball of fire' which was sighted over the South Street area of Salisbury during the early hours of Tuesday morning? Witnesses saw a Mount Pleasant garage proprietor hurriedly leave his premises and drive towards the object as it was leaving the area, shortly after it had been spotted.
"It was a bright object, reddish in color, and left a trail of smoke. It passed in a north-easterly direction at a high rate of speed, and disappeared in the distance, moving from south-east to north-west. The Department of Civil Aviation stated that it was not an aircraft, nor was it a meteorological observation.
"A Meteorological Office spokesman said 'It is extremely unlikely that it was anything of an astronomical nature. Some kind of unusual activity, possibly a meteor, but details are not known,' he added."
