The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page of text from what appears to be a Project Blue Book UFO report document. As per the instructions, I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Apparently there was some interference going on. Near the edge of the woods Ronald reported sighting the object. Coming out of the woods it seemed to glide and then came out of the woods in back of the house. About a few hundred yards it disappeared. The object did not make any sound. Earlier they did say out neighbors. Mr. and Mrs. They claimed to have seen something. The report was apparently made in the standard manner. As usual nothing was on the face of the house. Watermeyer family reported that no unusual prints or marks appeared on the lawn or house and that no strange odor was noticed. Except for the unusual "look" and "hand prints" at the trees, their report seemed to be straightforward and reasonable in view of the circumstances. Apparently traces of the incident were later found which seemed to indicate the presence of "humanoid" type creatures. Traces taken of the apparent landing site further substantiated this. However, Watermeyer was unable to furnish any additional information concerning the size, shape, or number of these creature traces or prints. As previously stated, no such marks or prints were found around the house or on the lawn itself.
