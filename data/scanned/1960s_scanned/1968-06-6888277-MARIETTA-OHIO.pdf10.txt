The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The diagram shows a circular shape with different colored regions labeled "Yellow", "Red", and "Yellow" again. There is additional text below the diagram that asks about the angular size of the object and instructs the viewer to "hold a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a street lamp or the moon" to determine how much of the object is covered by the head of the match.

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON, INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS VIEWED OR PHOTOGRAPHED, AND INDICATE CLEARLY ON WHAT TRAILS INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. HOW WOULD YOU HAVE COMPARED THIS ANGULAR SIZE TO THAT OF THE MOON OR OTHER KNOWN OBJECTS IN THE SKY AT THE TIME?
