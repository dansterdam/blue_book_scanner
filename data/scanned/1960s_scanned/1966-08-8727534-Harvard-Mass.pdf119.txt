Jungle Aviation and Radio Service
SUMMER INSTITUTE OF LINGUISTICS
LIMA - PERU
CABLE ADDRESS: "LINGUISTICA" SOUTH AMERICA

Sept. 28, 1966

United States Embassy
Lima, Peru

Gentlemen:

Yesterday a delegation of police officials and newspaper reporters came to our office to investigate the remains of an apparatus that had fallen from the sky. Apparently it was about 8 feet in diameter and saucer-shaped. It had remained suspended a few feet above the ground before falling on the edge of Lake Yarinacocha.

Witnesses had indicated that there was a transparent plastic balloon about a foot and a half in diameter attached to the device by three feet. There were also the remains of two resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors. Some of the parts apparently came from a small electric generator. The number 124 B 25 appeared on the circuit board.

We are not certain what type of device this was, but it is evident from the nature of the components that it was of an electronic nature. We would appreciate it if you would make an investigation of this incident and furnish us with any data that you may be able to obtain.

If you have any way 95 determining the place and date of the fall of this device, we would be glad to know. We feel that our neighbors in Yarinacocha would appreciate knowing the nature of this possible space phenomenon.

Respectfully Yours,

J. Wesley Swanson
Supt. of Radio Dept.
