The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch appears to be a compass rose diagram with instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction of a phenomenon observed. The smaller sketches show two different views of a landscape, with a person depicted in the center of each view.

Text from the document:

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "+" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATELY INDICATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. IN ADDITION, MARK THE APPROXIMATE AZIMUTH OR BEARING OF THE PHENOMENON AT THE FIRST SIGHTING AND LAST SIGHTING, ALSO THE ELEVATION ANGLE IF POSSIBLE. PROVIDE AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN, GIVING EXACT EXAMPLES OF HOW THIS IS DONE.
