1. The enclosed UFO sighting was reported to the Mill Valley Radar Site (ADC) as the enclosed letter indicates. However, by the time the information reached this office, it was too late for an on-the-site investigation.

2. This same phenomenon was seen by several other persons. Since these reports coincide with the enclosed information, statements were obtained.

3. The person who supplied the report and the color slide is a private individual.

4. Probable identity of this object has not been determined. As far as can be determined, there were no known aircraft, balloons or missiles in the area at the time of the sighting.
