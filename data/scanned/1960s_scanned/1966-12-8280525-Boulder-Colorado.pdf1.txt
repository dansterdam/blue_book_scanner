BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer watched a star-like object. The object's color was white, changing to blue-green and back to white before disappearing after the 20 minute observation. The observer was convinced the object was not normal when the object was stationary while the stars were moving.

The description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation, similar to a stellar magnitude of -2.9 is quite bright and when low on the horizon is often mistaken for a UFO.
