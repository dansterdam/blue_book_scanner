Dear Dr. Steinhoff:

In reference to our telephone conversation of 3 September 1964, please find attached hereto the promised prior stone.

It has a degree of hardness of 6-6, contains quartz, and is a pulverized state can be utilized as a mafic, including silica and other radiation.

I am convinced that the examination of this specimen could lead to an interesting result, especially in view of the fact that the world's best research facilities are at your disposal.

Should you have an interest in other materials, I can also make these available to you.

I personally am not in possession of these meteor stones; however, I can act as the go-between to procure them.

Respectfully yours,
