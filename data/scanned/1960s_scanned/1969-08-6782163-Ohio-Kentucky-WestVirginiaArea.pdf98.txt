The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with handwritten text that reads "ALL THIS VARIATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PRESENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS EXPLANATION ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDES A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING." The text also states "All informed the police and the previous witnesses" which appears to be referring to something mentioned in the report.

ALL THIS VARIATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PRESENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS EXPLANATION ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDES A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.
All informed the police and the previous witnesses.
