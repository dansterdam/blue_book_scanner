The incident began about 7:00 pm when 3 luminous, elongated objects were sighted maneuvering in the sky. They were observed for about 15 minutes. The objects were 25 cm long and 25 cm deep, and seemed to change size and color. They caused panic in the location and were compared to an explosive engine.

The report comes at about 10 p.m. local time (no details were given about the sighting itself).
