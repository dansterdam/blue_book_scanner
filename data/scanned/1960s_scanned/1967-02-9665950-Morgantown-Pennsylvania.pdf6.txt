The image contains a diagram with geometric shapes and annotations, but no photograph. The text in the document reads:

Calculation, the correction for the real diameter.
Notes: the apparent diameter is really the hypotenus of a right triange; and since this one is in a 45 degree over the correction merely multiplying the apparent diameter by 1.414 which is the ratio of the hypotenuse to the adjacent side of a 45 degree triangle.
