Dear Sir:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 3 April 1960 and the film received under separate cover which you believe contained evidence of an unidentified flying object.

We have examined the film thoroughly and compared it with the usual nature and motion of known aircraft. From this analysis, we are not able to substantiate the film as evidence of an unusual aerial object.

The film is being returned to you herewith.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE R. TACKER
Major, USAF
