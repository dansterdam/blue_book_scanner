The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and another curved line labeled "B" that appear to depict the reported path and trajectory of a UFO sighting. The second sketch shows a landscape with a road and some buildings in the distance, along with a smaller sketch of a structure in the sky.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where you first saw the object, and a "B" at the position where you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
