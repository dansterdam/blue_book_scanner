INCIDENT REPORT
1 APRIL 1967
SIGHTING INFORMATION:

At approximately 1300 hours on 1 April 1967, the witness, Mr. John Doe, was working in his yard at his home in Salem, Virginia, when he observed a strange aerial phenomenon in the sky. According to Mr. Doe, the object appeared to be a large, disc-shaped craft hovering silently above the trees. The object was estimated to be approximately 50 feet in diameter and was observed for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

Mr. Doe immediately contacted the local police department to report the incident. Officers were dispatched to the scene, but the object had already left the area and could not be located. The case was then referred to Project Blue Book for further investigation.

In the follow-up investigation, Mr. Doe provided a detailed description of the object and his observations. No other witnesses were identified in the immediate area at the time of the sighting. Analysis of the reported details did not reveal any obvious explanations for the observed phenomenon.

This incident is classified as "unidentified" within the Project Blue Book archives. The case remains open, pending any additional information or evidence that may come to light in the future.
