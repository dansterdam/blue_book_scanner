Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],
The President has asked that I reply to your letter of Oct. 1, concerning the aerial object you and your husband observed at approximately 9:30 p.m. October 1.
Possibly, you saw "Echo 2" or another satellite or object in earth orbit. Echo 2 is position over Alaska (east of Martain Polar path 9312 path), to degrees north, 70 degrees west. To degrees north, 70 degrees west. Because of the shape and perigee of the satellite, Echo 2 probably would have been visible not longer than 10 minutes.
It is possible that you viewed some other man-made object in orbit. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Cambridge reports that there are over 3,800 man-made objects in earth orbit, approximately 800 of which are regularly tracked and visible at various times. 
Some of these objects are in an orbit higher than Echo 2 and therefore would be visible longer than 10 minutes.
We hope this information is helpful.
Sincerely,
[SIGNATURE]
