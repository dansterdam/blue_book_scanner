34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 19 October 

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific paragraph above:
It was observed at 6:20 pm and I saw the object. I called to tell it was observed. It appeared to have a white light and proceeded in an easterly direction. Appeared to be moving at a tremendous speed. It followed it on Beaver Valley Road. While following I observed it go south to north and watched it until it was stationary in the north and then proceeded north and then west down the Road so I could get a closer view of the object. It moved back into its path north, stopped and winked out. After it had passed beyond me, I got back in the pickup and drove back-and-forth and the object was no longer there. When I drove out from the house where the object was observed, the object was gone.
