Oxnard, California 91202

Dear Sir:

This letter is in regards to sightings of objects on the nights of August 26 and 31, 1965, including a close encounter of the second kind. During this time, objects were observed in the sky that demonstrated unusual capabilities, such as hovering, accelerating rapidly, and changing direction abruptly.

The letter goes on to discuss the importance of the observer's report and requests the observer's intelligence in assessing the significance of the sightings. It also mentions that the observer may be able to visit in Valentine's, California if he is interested in further investigating the matter.

The letter concludes by stating that the author assumes objects A, B, and C were concurrently visible for a portion of the night of August 26-27, and that only object D was visible on the night of August 27.
