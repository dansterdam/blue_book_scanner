EXETER, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
3 SEPTEMBER 1965

One observer was hitch-hiking on Route 101 at 02:15 when he observed a bright red light appear over a group of trees about 1/4 mile away from where he was standing. The lights were in a line as if attached to an object and they were so bright they lit up the area. Only one light would disappear at a time. Observers watched these lights for approximately 15 minutes until they finally disappeared behind some trees and seemed to go into the distance. At one time the objects came so close that observer jumped into a ditch from being frightened by what he had seen.

Second observer arrived at Police Station after contact with woman in a car who claimed a light had been following her and stopped her for some time before moving on over the field.

Third observer arrived after having been called by second observer. He observed the lights which were still over the field, out toward the horizon. As he watched, the lights started to move around over the field. The lights were so bright it was difficult to make out any distinct shape. There was no sound or vibration but the farm animals nearby were upset and scared. When the lights started coming near again, the observer ran for his car.
