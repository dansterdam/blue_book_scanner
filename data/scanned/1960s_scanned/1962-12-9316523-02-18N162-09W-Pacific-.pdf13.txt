The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs, but rather a detailed description and analysis of an "Impressive Stellar Display" in the night sky and spacecraft Mariner's encounter with Venus in December 1962.

The text reads as follows:

ASTRONOMY

Impressive Stellar Display

Just a glance at the sky and the spacecraft Mariner will make the first close-up 
investigation of Venus in December.

ALTHOUGH ONLY ONE of them, Mariner, the spacecraft made an impressive display by passing Venus as it made its way to closer investigation of that planet.

The star, which is the one that is brighter than all others, is Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. It is shown just to the west (right) of the brilliant planet Venus, the bright object that is moving in towards the planet. To the south (down) is the constellation of Aquarius, the water-bearer, and to the northeast (upper right) is the constellation of Aries, the ram.

It is pointed out that on the evening of December 14th, at about 7:30 p.m. (standard time) at the beginning of the month, Venus will be the brightest object in the sky, outshining even Jupiter, which is very prominent in the south.

It is located in Leo, the lion. By midnight it has moved off to the west. This will continue through the month until Venus reaches its closest point to the Earth on December 14th, when it will be even more brilliant than at present. Then, as the month goes on, it will grow smaller and less bright, and by the end of December it will be low in the southwest and near another very bright star, and its red color will make it easy to identify.

The third December evening planet is Saturn, the ringed planet. At about 8 p.m. on the 14th, it will be high in the south, appearing as a bright star. Jupiter, Saturn and Mars are all planets - members of the solar system, this earth, and beyond.

The stars, however, are about suns much more distant than the planets, and their positions shift hardly at all from night to night as seen from the earth. This shifting is so slow that it is hardly noticeable to the unaided eye. Thus it is nearly 14,000 miles distant is about the same as the stars.
