I have become alerted to a series of small, bright lights, coming from what appears to be a metallic, cigar-shaped object, which is presently hovering over an adjacent field. The object is clearly visible and appears to be approximately 50 to 100 feet long, and the lights seem to be located along the side of the object. The object is emitting a pulsating light, which is varying in intensity. On occasion, the object appears to be rotating and the light can be seen moving along the side of the object. At times, the object appears to be reflecting the sun's rays, indicating a metallic surface. The object seems to be making no sound and is hovering approximately 100 to 150 feet above the field. I have been observing this object for over 15 minutes, and it shows no signs of leaving the area. I am unable to identify the object with certainty, but I am convinced that it is not a conventional aircraft. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
