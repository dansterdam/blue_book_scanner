No Case (Information Only)
30 January 1961
Greenfield, Massachusetts

On January 30, 1961 near Greenfield, Massachusetts a report was relayed to me by the Rev. Robbins Memorial Congregational Church in Greenfield. The report was concerning a home view from the church (of Greenfield) at 5:30 P.M. Her car was passed by a low flying object of huge size, which showed large, very bright white lights at the front and back and a flashing red light in its center. Miss Kemgas stepped into her car motor and watched the aerial object then turn off, pass directly overhead and move away at increased speed and vanish in the distance. It made a slight sound, like the hum of a child's spinning top, the said.
