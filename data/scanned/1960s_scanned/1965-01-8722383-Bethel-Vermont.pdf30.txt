Dear Mr. Bartell:

At 1:15 I have your card and thank you for making the report on the sighting of the strange object you saw on January 19th while observing near Bethel, Vermont.

Since no photographs were taken, all we have is the report from the observer. This, of course, is valuable in helping to establish the reality of such sightings. I wish to thank you for your cooperation in making this report.

Yours very truly,
C. P. Oliver
