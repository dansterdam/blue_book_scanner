CALIFORNIA

ENCOUNTER - 7 AUGUST 1969

WITNESS: Mr. Smith (pseudonym)

LOCATION: Near Los Angeles, California

DATE: 7 August 1969

TIME: Approximately 2030 hours

SIGHTING DETAILS:

Mr. Smith, en route home from work, observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to be moving erratically, rapidly accelerating and decelerating. Mr. Smith stopped his car to observe the light more closely. As he watched, the light appeared to split into several smaller lights that scattered in different directions before rejoining into a single, larger light. This sequence was repeated several times over the course of 10-15 minutes. Mr. Smith was unable to determine the nature or origin of the lights.
