The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The image does not contain any photographic content, but rather a diagram and associated text.

The text in the image reads:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was placed above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was placed when you last saw it. If it rose or fell during the observation, place a "C" on the corresponding part of the curve.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the observation.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
