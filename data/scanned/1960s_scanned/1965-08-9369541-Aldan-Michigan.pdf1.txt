10. CONCLUSION: Photo (not presently available) is consistent with probable identification of a known object, almost certainly a weather balloon. This sighting, in view of other similar reports, illustrates a continuing problem in the USAF that must be dealt with intelligently.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: According to the report, the observed object appeared as a bright, shiny, round object at a high altitude, moving in a straight path from horizon to horizon. It is concluded that this was probably a weather balloon, based on the physical description and the fact that "other similar reports" were considered.
