TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Headquarters USAF
Washington 25, D.C.

Attention: SAFOI

Dear Sirs:

Certain Hoover of the USAF New
Writer "should contact you regarding
a sighting. The circumstances are as follows:

At 5:30 to 5:45 a.m. on December the 12th, the writer was proceeding along the Susquehanna Turnpike, between Middleport and Stamford. I noticed a very rapidly moving red object crossing the sky, dead ahead. In a few seconds, it entered the Susquehanna River Valley, dropped down very near the surface of the car which I was driving in an approximate westerly direction.

Initially, the object glowed bright red and left a trail, then suddenly at about 10 seconds, a visible intensity change was noted; i.e. similar to a flash bulb going off; then the trail changed to a pulsating or oscillation-type motion.

The object appeared to be much closer than a normally viewed meteor or satellite, in fact, the intensity was considerably greater than the writer had ever observed for falling stars, and its color was much more the color of red phosphorous than the white of a meteor.

The writer would be pleased to supply any additional information he might could actually pinpoint the location of the automobile to within one mile if necessary.

Very truly yours,
