The image contains three sketches or illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved horizon with an object above it, and instructions to indicate how high the object was above the horizon. The second and third sketches show different views of a landscape, with a person standing in the foreground.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
