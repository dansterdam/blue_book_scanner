Reference the attached letter from ____ requesting information on an UFO sighting of 9 Aug 65. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear ____

Your recent sighting of 9 August 1965 is characteristic of many reports we receive. It tends to indicate an atmosphere of abnormal activity in the area, however, any major objects reported during this period usually have a satisfactory conventional explanation. A detailed track is not made. It is quite likely that you observed the remnants of one of these smaller fragments.
