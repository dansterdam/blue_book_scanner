CAN YOU BELIEVE THE CAMERA EYE?
SANTA ANA, Calif. Sept. 3 - Rex Hefline, 38, an airplane pilot, claims to have photographed two "flying saucers" that passed over his home here Saturday evening. On Aug. 31, Hefline was out in his backyard taking pictures of the sky when he says he noticed the two objects about 8:35 p.m. He says the objects were visible for 15 seconds and that he took two pictures of them with his camera before they disappeared. Hefline says the objects were oval and disc-shaped and were flying in a northeast direction. He says the objects were traveling at a rapid rate of speed. Hefline says he does not believe in flying saucers, but that he has the pictures as evidence and "if you don't believe me, you can see it for yourself." U.T.
