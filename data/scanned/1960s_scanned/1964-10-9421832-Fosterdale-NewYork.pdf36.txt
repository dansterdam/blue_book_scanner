Object Near Bowie, Arizona

Three adults, Mr. and Mrs. William Moss and their daughter, were driving near Bowie, Arizona, at 8:15 p.m., October 9, 1964 when they observed a strange object in the sky. 
Mrs. Moss was the first to spot the object. As soon as she did, she pointed it out to her husband. It appeared to be about the size of a baseball, glowing, and moving upwards. It appeared to ascend a short distance, then stopped. They watched the object for about 5 minutes and then it suddenly shot across the sky towards the mountains.
The light was not emitted from the object itself but seemed to be cast upward from the object into the sky. It was not observed to have any doors, windows or other appendages. As it ascended, it seemed to be a solid, single unit. Mrs. Moss reported that the object made no sound. The light was not blinking, but was a steady glow. She estimated that it must have been about 1,000 feet in altitude. For no apparent reason, the object then suddenly shot across the sky to the west and disappeared behind the mountains. 
At that point, Mrs. Moss turned to her daughter and asked if she had seen the object. Her daughter replied that she had and that it was "brilliant".
