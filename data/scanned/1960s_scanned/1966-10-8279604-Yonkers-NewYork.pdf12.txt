Yonkers, N.Y.
10/13

Gentlemen:

I am sure you must have received many hundreds of reports in regard to a flying saucer etc. and I trust you will not file mine in that category.

Because I am sincerely concerned in regard to the safety of our country, I feel it is my duty to report a strange object I saw in the sky last Sunday night at approximately 7:15 P.M. in the vicinity of Yonkers. The encounter occurred on Central Ave.

I had parked my car on Kimbolton and went to assist my wife to alight and at the time said object flew past at terrific speed.
