TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

The report of Unidentified Flying Object(s) was submitted by JOSEPH R. COVINGTON, the witness, on 6 November 1967. The report was filed with Project BLUE BOOK, which was the official U.S. Air Force program for investigating UFO reports.

The report states that on 6 November 1967, at approximately 1600 hours, Mr. Covington observed an unidentified object in the sky near Covington, Indiana. The object was described as round, silver in color, and approximately 50 feet in diameter. It was observed for several minutes before disappearing.

The report includes a photograph of the alleged UFO, though the quality of the image is quite poor and it is difficult to make out any clear details.
