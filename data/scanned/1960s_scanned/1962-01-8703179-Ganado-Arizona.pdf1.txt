10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Bright light above horizon directed toward southwest initially. Suddenly it moved rapidly up, accelerating sharply to incredible speed. Changed course and direction and disappeared into distance within a matter of seconds. No smoke or trail visible. Seemed to change also in size and intensity.
11. COMMENTS:
This is probably some type of light source, either natural or man-made. However, the incredible acceleration and disappearance within a matter of seconds is rather unusual. Cannot positively identify this observation.
