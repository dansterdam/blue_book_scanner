November 29, 1964

Dear Sir,

On November 9, 1964 Monday evening, Bridgewater, Mass, I looked up at the sky to see two strange oval shapes that appeared to be very clearly defined and they were spinning around and around and the shapes were colored a little bit of greenish yellowish color.

The objects appeared to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter and they seemed to be joined together. I also saw two other similar objects that were too small to be noticed, and the objects were so bright they seemed to be emitting some kind of light from within. It was a clear night, and the objects were going very fast. The objects changed direction quite suddenly, and I watched them go out of sight.

I suppose the Air Force would like to hear about this, and the objects were such a strange sight I don't know what to think. It made a tremendous impression on me, and I would be glad to give any other information if needed.
