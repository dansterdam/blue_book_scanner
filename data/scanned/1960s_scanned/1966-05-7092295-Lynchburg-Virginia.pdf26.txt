Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your letter of December 19, 1966. The United States Air Force does not investigate sightings of unidentified flying objects. This function is limited to the U.S. Government.

Enclosed is a brochure on Project Blue Book which describes the Air Force program on unidentified flying objects.

Thank you for your interest in our project.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch Division
