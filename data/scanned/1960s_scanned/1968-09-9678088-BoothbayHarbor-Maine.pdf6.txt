The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch shows a compass rose and instructions for indicating the sighting location and direction of motion of an unidentified object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "G" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN one object, then how many were there, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
