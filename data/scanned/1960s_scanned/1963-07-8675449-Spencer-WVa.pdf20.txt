'OLD BOMB MAY
BE ANSWER

Center mystery

A BOMB dropped 50 years ago could provide a clue to a mysterious wartime incident in which two Yorkshire miners were killed by an explosion. The explosion which took place on August 21, 1913, killed two miners at Bentley Colliery, near Doncaster, and there have been many attempts over the years to discover the cause. Now it is suggested that the explosion may have been caused by an unexploded wartime bomb. During the First World War, experimental bombs were sometimes dropped by aircraft for target practice, and some of them failed to explode. It is surmised that one of these may have been dropped in the area and lain undiscovered until detonated by the miners years later. There was some misunderstanding at the time about the cause of the explosion, and it was assumed to have been caused by a build-up of gas in the mine. This theory has now been discounted. There were a few other minor indications of some kind of wartime weapon being involved, but the full circumstances were never established. But we are now forced to conclude that this is the most likely explanation' says a spokesman."
