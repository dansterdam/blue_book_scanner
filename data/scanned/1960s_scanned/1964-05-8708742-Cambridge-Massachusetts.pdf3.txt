Dear Major:

I finally got around to calling you. This sighting was reported to a local news case from a campus police officer, who turned in the sighting of a flying object which took place here on our campus at the observatory a few blocks from the Observatory. On a very clear day, one came to see the objects from Logan Airport and also indicated that this was a very clear day with about 0.4 minutes coverage. He was in the parking lot with his assistant, two years old and they had been looking at some fairweather high in the sky, and since his son had been restive in the car, he suggested that he didn't come up to the window for the sighting, and it was at that time that he saw the object. 

The direction of the sighting was to the northeast of the horizon to about forty degrees above the southwest horizon where it was out of sight by the roof of the observatory. The duration of the sighting was only three or four seconds, and the object moved about forty or fifty degrees during this time. The statement made in his original letter that the object was moving from 1000 to 3000 seconds are per second at a time which he can't be sure, is erroneous tracking error. However, he is an experienced man who has been one of the men employed at the satellite tracking range, and so he seemed very reliable. The object remained unidentified, and there is no basic discrepancy between the data contained in this letter of 28 December. 1964 and that given many months later by telephone. Although there was one witness, he observed the sighting was a satellite, and operated a satellite tracking camera for three and one half years in Iran. It is for this reason that I took his observations very seriously, and I did what I could to supplement the phone call by my phone call. Yet, except in minor points, the account was identical with that given in his original interview. For the record, it might be good to go over a few of the essential points. He said he was fairly typical in the sky and had a feeling he was watching a fast. flat object which hovered in the sky and had a faint near-motion that was not failing.
