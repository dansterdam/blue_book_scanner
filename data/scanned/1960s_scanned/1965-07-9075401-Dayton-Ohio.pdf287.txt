34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 1/25 Feb, 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The observer states that the object appeared to be in a steady hover during the sighting. It was an elongated ellipse in shape, approximately 50-60 feet in length, and emitted no sound. The observer describes the object as having multiple lights that seemed to be part of the structure, rather than external lights. The object was observed for about 10-15 minutes before it accelerated and disappeared from view.
