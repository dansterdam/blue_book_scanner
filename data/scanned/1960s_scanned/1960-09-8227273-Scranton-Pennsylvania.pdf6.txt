I was rather surprised to find myself in the position I was in after the strange event which occurred. I had heard there was to be an unidentified flying object in the sky that evening and decided to go out and see if I could spot it. Sure enough, after going out and looking around, I saw a very bright light in the sky. It seemed to be hovering and then started moving around in a very erratic manner. I watched it for several minutes and it made some very strange maneuvers. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It would dart around quickly and then just stop and hover. At one point, it seemed to change direction instantly, almost as if it was responding to something. The whole experience was quite unsettling and I felt a little afraid. I'm not sure what to make of it all, but I know I saw something very unusual that night.
