The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on what appears to be an old document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

This is not exactly the sighting I
had in mind. I cannot recall at this
time all the details, but the object was
sighted by a number of people in the
vicinity of Pleasant Garden, N.C. It
was observed to make a steep dive and
then level off before disappearing. No
other details of the sighting are
available.

Pleasant Garden, the location
reported by the witness, is about
approximately 7 miles southwest of
Greensboro, N.C.
