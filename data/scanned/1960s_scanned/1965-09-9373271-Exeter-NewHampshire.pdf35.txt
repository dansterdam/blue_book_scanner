Request for UFO Information

Hq USAF SAFOICC (Mrs. Hunt)

1. We have delayed our reply to Mrs. Hunt's letter concerning the Exeter, New Hampshire sightings of 3 and 12 September 1965. This investigation from the U.S. Air Force Base was submitted to our office on 15 September 1965 and continued statements from local residents. This case has apparently caused considerable public interest in the sightings refueling area. The "Trapper" and refueling area "Down Wind" was observed intermittently during this period and was under constant observation from the controller over this refueling area and we were informed that they were closed from 03/15/65 to 03/30/65 for military operations. Our investigation indicates that these aircraft were of a military nature and the sightings were caused by the normal operation of the refueling.

2. The initial information of an object aircraft from the 4th Air Force operation "Big Blast" was the cause of the lights observed during this incident. The Air Force indicates that aircraft from "Big Blast" were refueling and apparently the air crews found the refueling area interesting and illuminated these aircraft for a possible evaluation or inspection.

3. The earlier sightings of two unidentified women and those of the Air Force tankers from Operation "Big Blast" cannot be specifically identified. 2 A. M. are regarded as UNIDENTIFIED. It is requested that you send a copy of their reply to these gentlemen.
