On Tuesday, March 8th I traveled to Hillsdale with Ann [REDACTED] and his driver - to investigate the Hillsdale case. We called first at the home of [REDACTED], County Civil Defense Director and neighbor of [REDACTED], Funeral Home. He has his pilots license, was in the Air Force and is a very knowledgeable and objective person. 

Mrs. [REDACTED] had "seen" an object the first call, a report from the girls dormitory - there were blue, red and white lights visible through the dormitory near the ground. Van Hom went to the back roof of his house and for 15 minutes scanned the skies and could see nothing. He said he did see a white light in the sky which appeared to change altitude from 210 to 270 degrees. His wife and son David observed it for about 20 minutes. He said it wasn't a star, and not an aircraft because it remained in the field of the binoculars for five minutes. But he could not identify what the object was.
