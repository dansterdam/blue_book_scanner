Mrs. Dixon Predicts
By Robert F. Manning
Mrs. Dixon who has been able to predict future events with startling accuracy, stated at a recent meeting of the Gaithersburg, Maryland, UFO Discussion Group that "the U.S. and Russia will have a space shot together within the next few years." She based her prediction on her contact with beings from another planet who have told her of their plans for the future betterment of the world. Mrs. Dixon feels that the time is rapidly approaching when the public will be told the truth about the existence of flying saucers and their occupants, and that this disclosure will be made by the U.S. Government.
