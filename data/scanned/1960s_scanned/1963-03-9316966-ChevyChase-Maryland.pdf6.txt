Fireball Over Eastern Seaboard

The night of March 22, 1963 produced a brilliant fireball at about 10:00 p.m. which was seen by thousands of observers as it passed over important cities along the Eastern seaboard of the U.S.

Coming from the north, the object passed over Allentown, Pa., Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. It was also seen as far south as Norfolk, Va. and Roanoke, Va. Long flaming trails were observed behind the object.

The object was seen over Pottstown, Pa. and along Maryland's eastern shore. Most experts agreed, however, the object was a meteor. However, Mr. Christie Urvick, an electronics engineer for the Air Force at the Germantown RCA plant, felt that the object's trajectory was not correct for a meteor.

The object appeared white with a long tail of orange and green toward the latter part of its flight. Pieces appeared to break off from the main object, leaving sparks. The main object also emitted flashes of light which were very brilliant. Hunting parties were organized to search for the object as some witnesses felt it had fallen to earth. However, no trace of the object was found.
