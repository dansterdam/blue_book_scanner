"On June 9, 1967, at approximately 1845 hours, Mr. T.L. Wallis of Excelsior, Minnesota, called the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office and reported observing an unidentified flying object. The object was described as being spherical in shape, silvery in color, and hovering about 50 feet above the ground. The object was observed for about 10 minutes.

Mr. T.L. Wallis stated that the object moved erratically, at times seeming to "jiggle" in the sky. It then shot straight up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. Mr. Wallis was unable to provide any additional details regarding the size or exact location of the object.

The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office notified the U.S. Air Force and provided a report of the incident. No further information is available regarding any follow-up investigation or analysis conducted by the U.S. Air Force."
