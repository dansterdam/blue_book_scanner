Transcription of the text in the document:

Mr. Chardron, Ohio - August 17, 1954, 4:00-6:00 A.M.
Mr. Chardron (name from citizen) and a civil defense volunteer witnessed an object, possibly the same object, from outside the police station on the bottom of the hill about 1 1/2 mile from city limits for about 15-20 minutes. He said it hovered from 4:00-4:30 A.M. and appeared to be metallic. He said, but "couldn't figure out what it was".

Mr. Farmer, and said that without his binoculars (Mr. Young's), he could not have seen it as well. With the binoculars he said it appeared to have "light-bulb-like" surfaces. It was about 1,000 feet up, he saw two objects, one larger and one smaller, circling each other. The larger object disappeared completely for about 10-15 minutes. Yet, no sound was heard. No trails of smoke or vapor were noted. Mr. Farmer said the object had risen to a higher angle of elevation. Mr. Traiman wore.

Summation: Only one object of large size, which might be the planet Venus, observed at approximately 4:30 A.M. during the time of observation. No trails, no sound, higher angle of elevation.

Editorial Comments:
It is still only one bright object seen in the eastern sky at 4:30-6:00 with the sunrise. No dark object was seen where the bright object was observed previously. The Farmer's object could have been Venus. The U.F.O. object could have been Venus.

Summation: Large bright object was the planet Venus. Atmospheric conditions contributed to some of the effects, making the light appear to be objects moving.

Editorial Comments:
Sighting: Lake's Tracking Center blackholed the whole sighting with Rofo I, without adequate knowledge.
The newspapers: The Telegraph and the following "paper."
