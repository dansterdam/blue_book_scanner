INTERVIEW WITH [redacted]
(The following sequence of events was given by the youths at the gravel pit where the object was sighted.)

The three youths drove into the gravel pit area sometime after 12:00 pm on February 19 (Sunday morning). They drove the car to the edge of the road and made a "U" turn, pointing the front of the car to the north. After making the turn, they noticed an unusual light off to the right of the car (east).
The source of the light was described as crescent shaped, giving off a pale-bluish white light. The object appeared to be on the ground. [redacted] was not specific as to the size of the object, but he did report that it appeared to be illuminated by reflected light. No sound was heard.
Weather at the time was heavy rain.
[redacted] had difficulty describing the details of the object on his first sighting. The youths were frightened and went into the town of Vachon, about 1 mile distant, to bring friends to the area.
Length of the sighting was estimated by [redacted] at about one minute.
They returned to the area with [redacted] and walked into the gravel pit and on the access road.
