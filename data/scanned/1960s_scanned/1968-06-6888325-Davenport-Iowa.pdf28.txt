The image contains two sketches or drawings, but no photograph. The larger sketch appears to be a compass rose diagram, with directions labeled around the perimeter. The smaller sketches depict two landscape scenes, showing a human figure standing in the foreground with a hilly or mountainous landscape in the background.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE - PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN; PLACE A DOT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A DOT AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. COUNT THE DEGREES BETWEEN THE X AND THE DOT. COUNT CLOCKWISE FROM TRUE NORTH. DRAW A SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

The text in the image provides instructions for the observer to use the compass rose diagram and sketches to indicate the position and direction of the observed phenomenon.
