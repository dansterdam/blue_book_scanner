The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet, which summarizes an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text in the document states:

"We were seated outside the dining room on approximately 12 June 1960. About 7:30 p.m. the area around us was lit up as if by a flare. From an eye level at about the top of the mountain there appeared a greenish light which seemed to travel towards the base of the mountain at about a 45 degree angle. It seemed no more than 5 to 600 feet over our heads, and was moving downwards in a southerly direction. It seemed to pause about a thousand feet below us and switch to a grayish-green color. We watched and listened but heard no sound."
