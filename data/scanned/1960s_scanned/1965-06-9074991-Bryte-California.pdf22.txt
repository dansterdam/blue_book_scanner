   On 7 June 1965, the Los Angeles office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) forwarded a letter to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, reporting the sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) near Bryte, California, on 6 June 1965. 

   The letter from the FBI stated that a male civilian witness reported that about 10:15 p.m. on 6 June 1965, he observed an unusual light in the sky while returning home from work. The witness stated that the light appeared to be hovering over a creek bed near Bryte, California, and then suddenly disappeared. The witness immediately reported the incident to the local police, who in turn notified the FBI.

   The FBI indicated that the witness appeared to be a reliable person and that the incident was reported in a straight-forward manner. No other witnesses were reported.

   No further information was provided by the FBI concerning this incident. A check of the Project Blue Book files revealed no additional data.

   This report is being forwarded to ATIC for their information and any action deemed appropriate.
