The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

Infrared Spectroscopic Methods:
1. The infrared spectrograms did not show the presence of any organic material. It did describe the presence of carbonate.
2. A chemical test for carbonates was negative.
3. A sample was heated slowly to 1100Â°C with no apparent change in weight or dimensions. This was some indication that it was from white to brownish material.

III. CONCLUSIONS:
1. The chemical composition of the sample is that of a bentonite clay. The material was consistent with sodium, potassium and calcium ions.
2. The object could be formed by a sudden application of heat, as a lightning bolt or as an air-to-air collision. The material has been exposed to heating, or in water dissolved and recrystallized to the present state.
3. The composition and nature of the object shows beyond doubt that it could not be part of a space vehicle or other space equipment.
