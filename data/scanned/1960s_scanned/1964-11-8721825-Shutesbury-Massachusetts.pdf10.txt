Dear Mr. [redacted], 
This is in reply to your letter of December 9. The letter describes a sighting of a UFO sighting. Fifteen years of research of over 12,000 UFO sightings have been consolidated and analyzed by the Air Force for scientific and control purposes. Thousands of UFO observations have been determined to be hoaxes, astronomical, or conventional. 

The Socorro, New Mexico, sighting is still unresolved. The object was described as a vehicle on the ground. Since we cannot find a satisfactory explanation, the case remains unresolved.

The glassboro, New Jersey, report is definitely a hoax. The object described was a vehicle parked on the ground, and the observers determined that the reported sighting was a hoax and could easily have been done by applying weight or any other simple means.

The newspaper you forwarded on the Shutesbury, Massachusetts, sighting on November 30, 1964 indicates there was no verifiable evidence or information. Whatever information was provided cannot be substantiated, and the report has to be classified as unidentified.

Since the report was not forwarded to NORAD, we assume that the object was an unidentified flying object, but the object was not proven to be of extraterrestrial origin.
