U.S. CLASSIFIED UFO
STATION A.IL
COL OPERATING
DEC 2 4 DECEMBER

"Stationary in a north-westerly position while against a clear
night sky a small disc 'lights' started to move in a procession
of one after another the same single file order they held while
still . . . By this time the six objects had circled our car
keeping the same approximate altitude and distance when they
abruptly stopped. Up to that time we were trying to out-run them
from about 70 m.p.h. to 130 m.p.h. (high stroked 396 83 Chevy).
However, they kept up and stayed slightly ahead as if mocking us.
. . . Finally they stopped off the passenger side, in turn we decided
to stop. As we both got out . . . the objects still in single file
separated. The last one moved a few thousand yards behind the
group after which the next to the last one (5th) slowly descended
to hover above the tree tops. After making these maneuvers they
remained so for a few sec. . . . At this point they gathered at
the spot where we had been and lined up in a front line position.
After circling the area they proceeded to buzz us resuming finally
their original positions. Upon reaching a sparsely populated area
the chase ended."
