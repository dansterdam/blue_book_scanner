The image appears to contain two illustrations. The first one is a compass rose diagram with directional arrows, labelled with abbreviations for the cardinal and ordinal directions. The second illustration is a larger sketch depicting a person standing on a road or path, with mountains or hills in the background.

Now, acting as an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

6A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X AT THE POSI- TION TO THE PHENOMENEN WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A B ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A B AT THE POSITION IT WAS LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO DO THIS.
