The image appears to contain a typed report or document describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting that occurred in Minneapolis, Minnesota. There is no photograph included in this particular page.

As an OCR system, I will now extract the text from the document:

Gentleman of the Air Forces:

I have photos of a UFO. You people will call it something else, due to the fact that you put down people who tell the truth about these things until the time comes when they are proved to be right in our time and space or not.

My name is E. J. live in Minneapolis, Minn. On Aug. 2, 1966, at approx. 7:30 pm, the object was going south in the eastern sky. It was not a plane, it did not have the type motors, running lights, etc that planes have. I filmed the film somewhere, and was not able to find it again. It looked like pictures in late magazines on current subjects and that is the type object that was at about 2 or 3 thousand feet we would estimate.

Time was about 7:00 & 7:30 pm. No airplane was around at that time.

Path was zig-zag, shutter of camera was open at about 4 to 5 seconds, exposure was also not too long, and the film has unusual markings and shadows on it caused by the strange object. Sometimes, and made-made material in the sky does not zig-zag.

Speed was about or over 1000 miles per hour.

Color of object was orangeish-white and looked more disk than round.

Sky was clear ( see stars in picture ). There was no lightning, nor was it a child's kite. And there was no heat or sound of any kind connected with the object. I got the tail of the path of the object, but do not know much about the object itself, other that it made pictures out of the negative, said "I don't know what the object is-".

Please send photo back to:
Minneapolis, Minn.
