The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document:

C. Weather and winds:
1. Light and scattered.
2. High scattered.
3. Cloudiness 5/10.
4. Visibility 7 miles.
5. No thunderstorm activity.
6. Ceiling temperature inversion from ground to 15,000. STG: 74 F.
7. No data.

H. Weather data: No. 2-7 obtained from Stewart AFS Weather service for OCOOL 17AUG.
I. N/A.
J. No air traffic and no weather balloon releases in the area.
K. Could have been a planet, which is the reason both that it was stationary at a high altitude and its velocity - the other possibility is that it could have been a planet, which is highly doubtful in my mind.
