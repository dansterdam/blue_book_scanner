There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a UFO report document related to Project Blue Book.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:                   15        October      1966
Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I can't remember anything else. Previous letter sent to you may fill in what I can't remember now.

I hope this information will help you in your studies. Being a schoolteacher, I always live up to the superlatives at school would not approve. I would appreciate it if you wouldn't write me further.

If there is something I remember that I haven't mentioned I will write you.

Respectfully,
