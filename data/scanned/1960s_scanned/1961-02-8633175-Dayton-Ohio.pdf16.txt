The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s and 1960s.

Text from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "T" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or man's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Plane with aircraft below it was seen to fly behind it and disappear 8:15 P.M. Feb 8, 1961. So it did not actually disappear.

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object or objects you saw.
Plane with aircraft below it was seen to fly behind it. So it appeared as if the plane and aircraft were one object since they overlapped each other.
