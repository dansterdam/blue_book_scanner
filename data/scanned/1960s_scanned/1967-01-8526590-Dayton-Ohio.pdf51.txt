SAM THIS REPORT A STUDY OF "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS". SOME FACTS WHICH HAVE COME TO LIGHT: A CAREFULLY CONTROLLED SCIENTIFIC STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT WHICH WOULD INDICATE EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN OF OBJECTS OBSERVED IN THE SKIES. MOST REPORTED OBJECTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, WEATHER BALLOONS, OR OTHER KNOWN PHENOMENA. SOME REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, BUT THESE LACK SUFFICIENT DATA FOR POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION.

AFTER ANALYSIS OF VERIFIED SIGHTINGS, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT WHILE SOME REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF THEM REPRESENT TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OR VISITATIONS FROM OUTSIDE THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE. PREVIOUSLY REPORTED "FLYING SAUCERS" OR "DISCS" HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED AS MISIDENTIFICATION OF KNOWN OBJECTS. FURTHER STUDY OF UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA CONTINUES WITH INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED SCIENTIFIC TECHNIQUES.

MYSTERY OBJECT SEEN OVER DAYTON. ANOTHER REPORT OF A STRANGE FLYING OBJECT CAME FROM DAYTON OHIO WHERE A CROCKETT RESIDENT, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY, TOLD THE DAYTON JOURNAL-HERALD HIS STORY. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL PEOPLE ABOUT 8:45 P.M. ON JANUARY 8. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A BRIGHTLY LIT OBJECT MANEUVERING IN THE SKY. SHERIFF DEPUTIES ALSO REPORTED SEEING THE OBJECT. THE U.S. AIR FORCE STATED THAT THERE WAS NO UNUSUAL ACTIVITY RECORDED IN THE AREA.
