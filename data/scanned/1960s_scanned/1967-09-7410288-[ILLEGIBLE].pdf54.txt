The image does not contain a photograph. It shows a sketch with diagrams and instructions related to a UFO report.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the sketch to indicate the point where you first saw the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the sketch to indicate the compass direction (azimuth) where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place a "D" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course of the motion.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Approx. 9. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
