JUPITER JOINS SATURN

Jupiter, in the constellation of Ophiuchus in the east, and Saturn in Aquarius to the south, will be visible in the evening skies.

By JAMES STOKLEY

AROUND this coming October we have two planets joining the stars of the night sky. These are Jupiter and Saturn.

Jupiter, in the east about 7:00 p.m., is now very bright. And in the east about 9:15 there is brilliant, yellowish Saturn, in Aquarius, the Water Bearer.

As the month goes on, the two planets will appear to draw closer together, until by the end of the month they are only about 4 degrees apart, appearing like a single bright object.

While they will not actually merge, they will appear one much fainter than the other. Every 2 years, 2 months the two planets go through this apparent close approach or conjunction.

At the time in the east about 7:00 p.m., Jupiter will be nearly overhead, shining even more brilliantly than Saturn. Around midnight, with Jupiter lower in the west, Saturn will be highest in the south, of the constellation figures but apparently they will appear separated by about a degree or even less.

The reason we say apparently they will appear separated is that their relative positions will really be determined by the line of sight. They actually will be millions of miles apart in the solar system. Their nearness is just an optical effect, as if you held up your thumb and forefinger a couple of inches apart and looked at distant mountains between them.

The southern edge of Aquarius lies just south of Saturn and the northern edge of Aquarius contains the star Sadalmelik, which was considered by some classical astronomers to be the "mouth" of the watery Aquarius figure.

Andromeda is in Northern Sky

High in the northern sky, Andromeda is ascending, said George Lovi of the Hayden Planetarium. Its brightest star Alpheratz, also called Alpha Andromedae, is now up in the northeast corner of the sky as darkness falls. To the left of Alpheratz lies Mirach. Below her royal spouse, the King Cepheus.

Just to the left, below Cassiopeia, is the compact star group of Andromeda, The large, bright star near the center is Mirach.

Use Mirach, the big bear, of which the stars are a part, to show nearly where the center of the Andromeda Nebula is located. This fuzzy patch of light, shaped like a fan, is one of the nearest major galaxies outside our own Milky Way.

Low in the east (Cygnus) the Northern Cross, with its brilliant first magnitude star Deneb, stands out brightly in the evening sky.

Aquarid Meteors

A little farther north. in Aquarius, is the radiant of the South Aquarid meteors, also called the Southern Aquariids. These are a minor meteor stream, peaking around September 1-5. Their normal rate is only about 10 per hour - but occasionally they produce some brilliant and unexpected fireballs.

According to the pictures on old star charts, Aquarius is an unusual mythological figure, a man pouring out a stream of water. Some astrologers have claimed this means Aquarius is a water bearer, but actually the figure represents a person swimming in the water, as you might expect for a water-bearer constellation.

Aquatic Animals in Patterns

A little farther south, in Cetus, the Whale, is a notable aquatic creature of the stars. This creature is represented as the monster who was supposed to devour Andromeda, until saved by the hero Perseus.

In the mythological lore, Aquarius, the Water Bearer, and Cetus, the Whale, are two of several aquatic animals and creatures in the patterns of the stars of the northern hemisphere sky.
