The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

"Am fact interested in UFO reports and have read several books and articles on the subject, Since about 1950 I have been studying the subject as much as I could on my own. I have not yet come to any one conclusion on the subject but do feel that more investigation could and should be made on the subject.

After reading the January 1962 edition of Science Digest which contained two articles on UFO investigation and UFO reports I decided to send a copy of this report to the Air Force's "Project Blue Book" organization to see if any investigation could be made of this sighting. It seems organization should feel it necessary to send one of these investigators to my home for a personal interview so I could answer any and all of their questions to the best of my ability. I am presently enrolled as a student at the Detroit College of Law. My address is as follows:

Walled Lake, Michigan
48088

I know there is nothing very unusual about my report in relation to others you have received, but I thought you might be interested in reading this report."

Very Respectfully
