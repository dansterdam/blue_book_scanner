9 April 23,
There was something strange that happened to me last night that I thought youought to know about. At about 9:00 p.m. an object that looked like a saucer, about 30 or 40 feet in diameter, hovered over my house for over 15 minutes. It had a brilliant light that seemed to be the source of the light itself.
I wanted to report this to you as soon as possible. Please let me know if you would like any further information from me.
Sincerely yours,
Richard Melby
