13. DID THE PHENOMENON:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COURSE?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN OR ROTATE?
MAKE A NOISE? (If so, describe)

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

Glistening above us at a 20 degree angle, slowly moving away, made no sound. It faded out (Corle sight) until it was gone.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
