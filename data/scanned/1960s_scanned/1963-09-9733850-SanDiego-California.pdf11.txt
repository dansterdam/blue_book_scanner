TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

We would receive many written reports from the witnesses of unusual aerial sightings. (See Sept. 1) and would carefully analyze them for pertinent information to help us determine the nature of the various phenomena. Los Angeles.

Since the date of Sept. 10, (I understand) there is information which reaches us on Sept. 3 and 9 from other witnesses at the scene of this particular sighting.

These additional witnesses and somewhat anonymous associates express certainty that what was seen (as far as we can determine) is not a conventional aircraft. For a careful analysis during the early summer, tentatively, we would indicate that the object or objects sighted have a less conventional characteristics, for similar obvious reasons, and other interpreatation must be considered.

We have reason to believe an aircraft encountered was seen to pause, to hover, to exhibit sudden accelerations, and then disappear. This information has even received.

Since case witnesses, and other concerned people, to attract this thing case, we two enclosed sheets is other pertinent information; one is an article that discusses a sighting data extract observation, such as it is not known whereabouts or status of the object or disappearance, but at radio or secondly to 20 or 30 seconds, and at a later a further report 1 minute or 1 1/2 minutes, at approxmatily one second (possibly not the highest).

No specific conclusion can as yet be drawn on the definite shape, size or color of the object seen, as details of observation by witness were relatively scanty. It will appreciate if such further data as may available can be provided.

NOTES: "52-4" was not seen upon the date of the conclusion of this report.

The cover sheet was made out on 7/30 and the continuation was dated 9/27, 1963.
