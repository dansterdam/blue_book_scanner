The image does not contain a photograph. It is a photo analysis report from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 6-64
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: Redwood City, California
PHOTOGRAPHY: One 35mm color slide provided by USEW
QUALITY: Poor
PURPOSE: This report answers work order #64-120 submitted by Major Quintanilla USEW. The request forwarded a photo and color slide of a purported unidentified flying object.
ANALYSIS: Microscopic study of the attached 35mm slide by the photo analysts and photo processing personnel revealed the following conclusions:
a. No true photographic image is visible on the chip.
b. The visible image could be film flaw or a duplicated flaw or chip in the emulsion.
c. The constant density from film edge to film edge could indicate that the image was not exposed in a camera, but rather had been exposed.
