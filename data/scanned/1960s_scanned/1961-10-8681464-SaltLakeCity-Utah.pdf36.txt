'Saucer' Soars in S.L. Pilot After Chase

THE PILOT reported he had sighted what he thought to be a "flying saucer" about 2:30 p.m. Monday over Salt Lake City Airport.

Mr. Harris told officials the object moved away in a series of short climbs and dives, and then shot straight up and out of sight.

THE AIR FORCE said no further investigation was under way regarding the reported sighting, saying that the plane was not acting in an unusual manner.

SALT LAKE CITY, had just landed, said he didn't see anything unusual except that the object "wasn't there when I came back."

CLARENCE WILLIAMS, some of whom used binoculars to observe the object, said they saw a silvery disc-shaped craft.

The airport radio tower operator, Doyle Card, said "I saw it, I'm sure of it." He said the object moved in a series of up-and-down movements for about five minutes.

ALL OF THE witnesses reported the object moved at a terrific rate of speed.

LITTLE SEA WEATHER BALLOON

The weather bureau said it had no weather balloons in the air at the time. However, some balloons had been released shortly before the reported sighting, and some thought the object might have been one of them.

The weather bureau said it had recorded 75 to 150 weather balloons in the air at various times during the day, some registered as being from Dugway Proving Grounds, Tooele.

MANEUVERS IN THE SKY

The object, according to several witnesses, hovered and then made a series of up-and-down movements at a terrific rate of speed. At one time, it almost looked like a solid object, and all of us have seen these things before, but never this close or this long.
