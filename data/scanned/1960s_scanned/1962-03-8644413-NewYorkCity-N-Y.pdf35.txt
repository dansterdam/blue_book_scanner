"BRISTOL SAUCER

Mr. T. F. Lilley, a draughtsman, stated that on March 17, when he was the Bristol Saucer appeared in the sky at about 7:15 p.m. and was observed for about 10 minutes.

He described the object as being a bright silver, circular shaped, and apparently 40-50 feet in diameter. It was first seen hovering over Kingswood and then moved slowly across the sky in the direction of Hanham, near Bristol. The object then appeared to turn on its side and descend at a 45 degree angle, disappearing into the distance.

Mr. Lilley stated that he saw the object clearly defined against the sky. He was watching it through binoculars and could see that it was definitely not an aircraft. The object appeared to be making no noise. This sighting was confirmed by a number of other people in the area."
