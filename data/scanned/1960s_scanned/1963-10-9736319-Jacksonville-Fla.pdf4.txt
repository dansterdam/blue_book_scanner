FLYING SAUCERS ON THE MOON: The following is quoted from an article in the "Information Only", Volume 1, No. 7, March, 1965.

"Last for over sixty years without being sighted again." On Oct. 29th and Nov. 27th, 1954, 8:30 p.m., Dr. James E. McDonald, professor in the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, University of Arizona, Tucson, saw two brilliant circular, lenticular, diamond-shaped and U-shaped objects hovering and maneuvering across the sky for over three miles. They performed incredible formations and feats across the sky at a distance of about 500 feet. They were visible for about 10-15 minutes. These circular, elliptical, diamond-shaped and U-shaped craft were silent and made no sound and appeared to be under intelligent control. They were almost 700 feet in diameter, clearly visible, and occasionally seemed to merge in and out of each other. At times they left a trail of light and sparks behind them, and at times they were absolutely silent as they moved. 

"And that's not all between these 'spats' there were missilings for these so-called "spars" or "spats" were either going to at least 500 feet and since they were discernible, They went back and forth across the sky. I saw a great metallic lights going on and off according to an initial pattern and just blotting out the stars behind them. There was an utter absence of noise or sound, and of course, this is the main thing that can be deduced from a sight like this. These craftsmen behaved in ways which astonished me in their technical features capability of advanced maneuvers, speed, and courage to acknowledge that this is strange and not-according-to a normal pattern of aviation. I was convinced that I was witnessing beyond any shadow of a doubt a manifestation - and a rather awesome one - of unidentified flying objects."
