34. Date you completed this questionnaire:        3        March        1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a descriptive explanation of your sighting.

An object similar to the one described in this questionnaire was sighted on 7/30/66 at 10:30 PM EDT west to east over the area end of Frankfort, Kentucky. It appeared circular in shape and exhibited a brilliant white light. Witnesses estimated its size as 1,200 - 3,000 feet. It moved at a slow speed and in an erratic manner. Witnesses who observed it were in an automobile and stopped their car to observe the object. It remained in sight for about 10 minutes, but it appeared to be moving very high. It got smaller and disappeared. I can find no other details except that it appeared to be closer than my husband estimated (I would guess it would be between 1,000 and 1,500 feet) . The sighting area has been used for many years by the US Army and USAF as a research and training site. Details are sketchy, but the object was most unusual. I cannot give any other information as to its identity.
