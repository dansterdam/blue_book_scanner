The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a report document, specifically from Project Blue Book, which was a US Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The page is mostly blank, with some text at the top and a header indicating "APR 80-17(CI)". The rest of the page is empty, likely intended for the witness to provide a detailed description of the sighting.

Here is the text from the document:

APR 80-17(CI)
