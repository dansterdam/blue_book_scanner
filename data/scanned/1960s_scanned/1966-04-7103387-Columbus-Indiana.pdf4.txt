Dear Sir
I would like to thank you for your letter and the booklet Project Blue Book. I found them very interesting.
At approximately 9:30 April 16, 1966, three friends and I were outside when five objects flew over our heads traveling SW. The objects were easy to see against the sky. They had a white glow and they moved very fast.
Friends:
