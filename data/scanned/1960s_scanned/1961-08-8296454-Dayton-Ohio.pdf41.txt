The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a marked point "A" and "B", and an object above the horizon line. The second sketch shows two larger scenes - one appears to be a landscape with a person standing on a road, and the other appears to be a landscape with some hills or mountains in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (eyeline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show the position of the object when you last saw it. Show how high the object was above the horizon (eyeline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
