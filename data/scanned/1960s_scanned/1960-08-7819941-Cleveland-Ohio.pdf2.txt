The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The document appears to be part of a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads:

"7-10-66
Mr. Edgar Horton
7-13-66
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

As requested, I am returning the original document, as I was unable to make any copies for my own use. I sincerely hope you can find some use for this information.

Thank you for your interest. I shall await your reply.

Sincerely yours,"
