The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, that includes handwritten text describing a sighting or observation.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:      Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
We observed the object at about 1:30 a.m. on December 6, 1965 in Waterford, Pennsylvania. The object was round shaped, glowing a deep orange color. It appeared to be hovering approximately 50 feet off the ground and was maybe 15-20 feet in diameter. We observed the object for approximately 10 minutes as it slowly moved across the sky going from the west to the east. The object then suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. No sound was heard during the sighting. The night was clear and visibility was good. This was a definite unidentified flying object that we observed and could not be explained by any natural or man-made phenomenon.
