UFO 8-47 23 1962
At about 8:15-8:30 p.m. on April 23, 1962 I noticed two weird looking objects east of Lincoln Park, Michigan.
They appeared to be floating or hovering in the sky and remained stationary for over a half an hour.
They were about the size of standard electric light bulbs but longer and more slender. They emitted a steady stream of standard electric light.
They seemed to be as close as a electric light setting, although there was no standard type of electric light anywhere near the scene.
A few times the lights would get dimmer and then return to normal in a couple of seconds.
I checked against buildings by standing and it was lower than the electric light utility poles to the west.
The objects remained in about the same spot for over 30 minutes less than 200 ft away.
But still is last i had that this is a aerial phenomena. I cannot explain what i actually saw.
Sincerely,
