The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will proceed to extract all the text from the document:

And radio station explained the report with detail. I have in Elyria, South of the city and other object was going northward. As I was listening to the broadcast, I became interested at the object. It was stated that the object was very large and bright light. I have never seen anything like it before. They stated that it hovered on the site and then left very fast. As I looked at it closely it appeared to be several lights, red, green and white revolving around the center. It got beyond me so clear with the binoculars. I decided to call my wife to see if she could see it, as I do not get excited about such things. And decided that I will turn on the television, but the opposite side of the set.
