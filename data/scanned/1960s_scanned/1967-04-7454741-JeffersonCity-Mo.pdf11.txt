Attn: TDPT (UFO)

Reference: Your letter of 23 April 1969
Subject: UFO Sightings of 3 April 68 from Cochrane, Wis. and
17 April 1967 from Jefferson City, Missouri  

To: Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

1. Enclosed is copy of letter to Mrs. - dated 18 February 1969 as requested in your above referenced letter.

2. I am unable to send you the first transcript of my conversation with the witnesses because inadvertently something had gone wrong with my tape recorder and I got nothing but a garbled sound. I can assure you that the contents of the second tape are largely the same as the first.
