Northwestern Airlines Lights
August 13, 1963

"Strange lights" reportedly 4 to 8 in number, approximately 15,000 ft. and moving at high speed, were observed by the crew of Northwestern Airlines Flight 263 going from Chicago to Denver. The crew stated they were moving faster than a plane behind a plane [sic] near Chicago. 

The crew reported seeing the lights at 8:45 p.m. as they were cruising at 15,000 ft. The pilot stated the lights were flashing and white in color. The flight engineer reported they were very fast, traveling at an estimated speed of 1700 mph. The pilot said they were very high and traveling at tremendous speed. The pilot said they were in view for about 20 seconds. The pilot also said the lights he saw were not aircraft lights, and he does not believe they were stars or planets.

This report is supported by Mr. Alexander, the flight navigator, who stated he also saw the lights.
