To Officer in Charge:

Middle River, Md.
November 5, 1962

I am a night operator for the Electrical Boat Co. in Middle River. About 5:30 A.M. this morning on my way to work, I observed a light in the sky which appeared to be moving considerably faster than any ordinary aircraft. It was not blinking and traveled in a horizontal level manner, covering a wide area before disappearing. I called the control tower at Essex to verify if any aircraft were in the air at that time, but was told none were. I have never seen anything like this before and am quite puzzled by what I observed. I would appreciate any investigation your office could make regarding this incident.

Sincerely yours,
