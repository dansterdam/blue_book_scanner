The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report with text describing and analyzing photographic evidence.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 55-44, DATED 16 November 1966

Frames #6, #7, #8 and #9 - Once again, multiple moon images indicate that several different exposures were made.

Frame #10 - In frame number 19, it appears as though the camera was swung to two different light sources in order to make two tracings.

Frame #11 - Two, possibly three, exposures were utilized to make this photography in a dual-imaged background.

Frame #12 - The spaceship is in an ideal location and approximately the correct intensity that would correspond to the peculiar highlight on the front element of a camera lens pointed directly at a bright light.

Frame #13 - This is probably a single exposure since the moon image is smaller than in the other frames. Once again the spaceship is probably a peculiar highlight caused by the light source to the lower left.

It is the considered opinion of this office that the furnished materials and photographs represent primary evidence that the imagery was allegedly created by the Chief, Photo Analysis Branch.
