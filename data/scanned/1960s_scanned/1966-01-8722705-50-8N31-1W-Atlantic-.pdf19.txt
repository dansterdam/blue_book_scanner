SUBJECT:
Unidentified flying object report.
On March 29, 1966 at approximately 2214Z, while conducting routine electronic countermeasures training over the Atlantic Ocean, the crew of an EC-121J aircraft observed an unidentified object at approximately 16000 to 18000 feet altitude.
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
The object was described as round in shape, approximately 20-30 feet in diameter, and highly luminous, with a red-orange glow. It moved in a straight line at a very rapid rate of speed, covering an estimated distance of approximately 20-30 miles in a matter of several seconds. The crew estimated the speed to be in excess of 3000 knots.
SUPPORTING DATA:
The object was observed visually by all crew members and detected on the aircraft's airborne radar. However, due to the extremely rapid speed of the object, no radar lock-on or tracking was possible.
WEATHER:
The weather conditions were clear with visibility of 10-15 miles. The wind was from the southwest at 15-20 knots.
CONCLUSIONS:
The object could not be identified as any known type of aircraft or phenomenon. The extreme speed and manner of flight ruled out the possibility of a conventional aircraft, satellite, meteor, or any other natural phenomenon. The crew was highly experienced and has reported numerous other unidentified aerial objects during their many years of flight operations.
