Subject: Unknown sighting.
1. On the evening of July 8, 1964, this observer was alerted to the presence of strange lights in the sky near his residence by a neighbor. Upon looking, the observer saw two strange lights maneuvering in the sky at an estimated altitude of 2000 to 3000 feet. The lights appeared to be round or oval in shape and had a grayish color. They seemed to pulsate and vary in intensity. The lights were observed for about 15 to 20 minutes before they suddenly disappeared. During the sighting, the observer attempted to attract the attention of other neighbors but was unable to do so.
Respectfully,
