The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with handwritten text on it.

INFORMATION WHICH MAY HAVE ANY BEARING OR RELATION TO THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IS NOT ACCURATELY CONVEYED IN THIS COMMUNICATION.

The text appears to be a detailed first-hand account of a UFO sighting, describing the object's appearance, movement, and the witness's reactions. The text mentions the object being "bright" and "ball-shaped," and that the witness felt "very upset and nervous" while observing it. The text also discusses possible explanations or theories about the nature of the object, but ultimately concludes that it was not something identifiable.
