14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It went over the trees and disappeared.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes. IF you answered Yes, it moved behind.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes. IF you answered Yes, in front of.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound - It made no sound b. Color - White or color dim
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and estimate how much of the object is covered by the match head. if you have performed this experiment, how much of the object would the match head cover? At water it would cover 1/4 its size.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing the direction of motion, relative size, color, and specifically indicate trails or visible rotation or other characteristics which you observed. Diagram contains a drawing of an oval-shaped object with a "trailing angle" and labels indicating "Oval," "Quite white," and "Traveling angle."
