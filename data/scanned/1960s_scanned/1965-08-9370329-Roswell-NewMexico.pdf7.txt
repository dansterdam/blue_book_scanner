Dear Mr.
Reference is made to your report of an aerial obiec' which you observed on 24 August 1965.
The dimness of the object, horizontal flight of approximately 30 degrees, and the other characteristics described are typical of an observation of a bird as a sight.
Although reports of this nature are rare, we do receive an average of four a year.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Community Relations Division
