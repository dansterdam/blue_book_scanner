CAUSE OF OUR STRANGE ELECTRICAL PHENOMENON WAS EVIDENTLY EXAMINED THRU COMPLETE MILITARY CHANNELS AND PROCEDURES FQR INVESTIGATION AND EVALUATION. 

REPORT OF THE UNUSUAL ACTIVITY WEST OF FRANKLIN SPRINGS, N.Y.

THE TYPE OF PHENOMENON WITNESSED WAS APPARENTLY OF THE SAME GENERAL NATURE AS HAVE BEEN RECORDED BY THIS STATION BEFORE ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS. THE PHENOMENON CONSISTED OF AN INTENSE LUMINOUS ACTIVITY OBSERVED OVER A SPECIFIC AREA OF THE COUNTRYSIDE, ACCOMPANIED BY MARKED ELECTRICAL DISTURBANCES. VISUAL OBSERVATIONS BY MANY WITNESSES ESTABLISH THAT THE LUMINOSITY WAS OF GREAT INTENSITY, AREA COVERAGE,AND DURATION. ELECTRICAL EFFECTS ON RADIOS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT ALSO WERE NOTED. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE OCCURRENCE WAS NOT WITHIN THE NORMAL REALM OF NATURAL ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA, NOR DID IT BEAR CHARACTERISTICS OF ANY KNOWN MILITARY OR EXPERIMENTAL ACTIVITIES IN THE AREA.
