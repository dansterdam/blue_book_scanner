The image contains a photograph in the upper half of the page. The photograph shows a sketch or diagram with instructions for the viewer. The diagram includes a curved line labeled "A" and a compass-like dial. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine themselves at the point shown and to draw a picture of the motion of the object or objects observed.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Please draw an arrow from horizon (skyline) to show the direction (bearing) when you first saw it. Please an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
