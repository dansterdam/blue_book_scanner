The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

As an OCR system, I have produced the following text from the document:

I have made a diligent search among the files available to me in an effort to locate any information which might be of assistance to you regarding the object which was reported to have been observed at Niagara Falls, New York, on September 8, 1966. I will, of course, relate to you all of the facts and details that I have been able to ascertain in connection with this case. 

This people had a white color, and seemed to be surrounded by a slight glow of a pale-blue color. The object was approximately 15 to 20 feet in diameter and was observed to have a very rapid hovering and darting motion. It was reported to have been observed by four persons and they were all trained observers - a detective, a college student, a businessman, and a former member of the Air Force. Their testimony indicates that the object was in view for some 5 to 10 minutes, and they were able to make a good visual observation of it. They reported that the object appeared to be under intelligent control, and that they observed a slight pulsating motion, and a humming sound was audible as the object approached and departed. 

I regret that I do not have any additional information or physical evidence which I could make available to you in this case. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to assist you in your investigation of this incident.
