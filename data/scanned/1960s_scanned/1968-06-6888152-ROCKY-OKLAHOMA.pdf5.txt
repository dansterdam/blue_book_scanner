M2m0 FOR THE RECORD
27 June 1968
Subj: UFO Observation, 19 June 1968
Lt Downey called on 21 June 1968 at 1135 hrs to say that disaster control had checked the area and that there is only normal background activity. I asked Lt Downey to check local police, state police, and local at Hobart, Cordell etc. and see if they received any reports. See if local radars tracked anything either identified or unidentified at or near the time of the sighting. I also asked him to transmitt all the above information (including statement that there was no abnormal radio activity in the area) to us. I also told him that in the future they should also transmitt a 7DX to the University of Colorado in accordance to 80-17A but that I would do it for this case.
