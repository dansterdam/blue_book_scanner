The UFO sighted at 1:15 a.m. on 5 May 63 over Arlington Heights, Illinois, was observed by two witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. The object was first observed through a window of their residence. It appeared to be a brightly lit object with an apparent diameter of about 30 degrees of arc. The object hovered for about 15 minutes, then began moving at a rapid rate of speed to the east. During the observation, the object was seen to change color from bright white to red and back to white. When the object moved away, it appeared to diminish in size. The witnesses were impressed by the brightness and apparent size of the object. They had no explanation for what they had observed. The weather was clear at the time, and no other aircraft were observed in the area. The report was submitted to Project Blue Book for investigation.
