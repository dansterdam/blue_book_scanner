Analysis and Conclusions: THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS ALL OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A VERY BRIGHT VERY FAST MOVING OBJECT. IT WAS SEEN FROM A POINT TO A POINT BY SEVERAL OBSERVERS AND THERE SEEMS TO BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE UNUSUAL NATURE OF THE OBJECT. THE FACT THAT A GEIGER COUNTER WAS AFFECTED GIVES SOME SUGGESTION THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN OF RADIOACTIVE NATURE. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BRIGHTER THAN THE BRIGHTEST STAR AND STREAKED ACROSS THE SKY WITH AMAZING SPEED. IT FAILED TO CONFORM TO ANY OF THE USUAL PHENOMENA.
