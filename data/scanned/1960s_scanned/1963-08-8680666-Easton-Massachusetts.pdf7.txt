There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a document that contains handwritten text.

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

I have seen in the air what seems to be strange and inexplicable in the heavens around 8:30 or 9:00 and the things are still seen clearly on nights when there are only a few clouds.
The phenomena observed approximate from 100 to 1500 feet altitude. I came here on the 18th at the appropriate time to see if possible whether this was still noticeable and I saw the lights as described on several occasions though I was not able to get a photograph of them. I would be very happy to furnish any details I can on this subject and provide specifics as to times and location of the observed phenomena if so desired.
