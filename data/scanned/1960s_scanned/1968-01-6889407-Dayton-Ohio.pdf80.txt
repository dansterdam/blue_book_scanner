REPORT OF INVESTIGATION - UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
(BASED ON USAF PROJECT BLUE BOOK ACTIVITY)

DATE: 29 Dec 1959

CASE - GT-3-59
FROM: Captain Ruppelt, Project Officer
THRU: SAFOI - U.S.A.F. 
TO: USAF

Dear Colonel Report:

Enclosed is the report of a case of a very strange and unexplained incident that occurred on 29 Dec 1959 near Phoenix, Arizona. Considerable investigation has been conducted by this project, and the results are presented herein. Public information is given where classified data is not involved.

No doubt, my request will be brought to the attention of SAFOI regarding our investigation of UFO sightings. Information and advice would be appreciated, as our director feels that this case warrants a very careful and thorough investigation.

My own feeling is that many UFO sightings do indicate the existence of strange aerial vehicles, the origin of which can be foreign or domestic. Their capabilities may exceed those of the best-known aircraft and often perplex professional observers of Air Force, National Guard, and civil aircraft. Every effort will be made to accumulate facts and determine the true nature of this case.

May I hear from you? Thank you very much for giving this matter your attention.

Sincerely,
RAYMOND H. FOWLER
