cont'd.

At the time the UFO disappeared, I noted the time to be 1345 local (1245z). The total time of the UFO sighting was no more than two to three minutes.

It is interesting to note:

a. During the sighting, all the clouds in the general area maintained their relative position and as the UFO maneuvered, it was easy to observe its relative position in R-250.

b. The presence of these clouds and the haze layer had a tendency to camouflage the visual sighting of the UFO.

c. The UFO maintained its altitude within the top of the haze layer. Because of this I was not able to discern its exact shape or substance.

d. It left no trail and flew through the atmosphere blending well with the existing weather phenomena that prevailed at that time.
