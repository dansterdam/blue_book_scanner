11. COMMENTS: The object reported for this date was probably an observation of a high bright star or planet, and the reported movement and position changes are those expected for a celestial object under atmospheric refraction. The brightness changes described are also typical of a bright star or planet under varying atmospheric conditions. Therefore, the description and motion of the object reported is not consistent with a true unidentified flying object, and no further investigation is considered necessary.
