SIGHTING INFORMATION:
My objective reaction was one of real mystery and awe. The object was approximately 3 feet in diameter, an 1 to 1.5 feet thick. It was brilliantly lighted, and seemed to be revolving slowly around a horizontal axis. It was virtually silent and appeared to be located about 300 feet above the ground. I watched it for approximately 5 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. It is obvious that what I saw does not fit into any conventional explanation. Although I am not claiming it was an extraterrestrial craft, I do feel I saw something highly unusual which deserves further study and investigation.

AS WHEN DID YOU REPORT THAT YOU HAD SIGHTED THIS PHENOMENON?
