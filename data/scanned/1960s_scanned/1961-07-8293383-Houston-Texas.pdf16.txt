...Going Up!

By Nick Divine
Staff Writer, the Union

Sacra-mento Union writer Van Vogt says
that if the missing Sacra-mento Union
newsmen turn up in another world, "I think
they'll be going up in the air, not down."

The Union's interstellar claim:

"Things often go up, and it's my theory that
the Union editor has been preparing for an
upward departure. He is literally going up,
and his departure seems imminent!"

The Union Tuesday let down. And
as upward departure for the Sacra-mento newsmen has not materialized.

A cynic al reader wrote to Van
Vogt about the headline, "Going up."

"If you're so sure they're going
up, how about a picture of them
doing it?"

Van Vogt, who is an expert in
space travel and metaphysics, was
unable to produce such a picture.
But now, the Union has obtained
one. This dramatic and authentic
photo clearly shows the newspaper-
men beginning their mysterious
leap into the ether. Space officials
are investigating the incident.

The Union carefully notes that it
cannot identify the persons shown. But
the photo does seem to provide
"a suggestive glimpse of their fate!"
Close the New York Times, Washington Post, Sacra-mento Union - the
Union has the story. So let the reader draw his own conclusions.
It is sufficient to say: They're going up!
