The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The document discusses a UFO sighting on January 23, 1968 near Columbus, Ohio. It mentions that the sighting was reported to the Base UFO Officer (Col. Hinkle), who had received two reports of UFOs on that date. However, the sighting was not investigated further because it did not fall under the category of valid UFO reports according to regulations. The document states that Col. Hinkle indicated he would probably receive a Congressional inquiry about the report and that it would have to be investigated. He replied that he would do what he could regarding the investigation.
