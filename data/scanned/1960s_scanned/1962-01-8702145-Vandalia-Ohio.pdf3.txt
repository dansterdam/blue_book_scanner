BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: A BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHT WAS OBSERVED TO BE STATIONARY FOR A WHILE, THEN MOVED AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE LIGHT WAS BRIGHT ORANGE AND APPEARED TO BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THE TRAIL THAT WAS LEFT BEHIND. THE TRAIL WAS BRIGHT ORANGE IN COLOR. WHEN THE OBJECT MOVED AWAY IT TURNED TO A VERY PALE COLOR AND FINALLY DISAPPEARED.
EVALUATION CASE CATEGORY: PROBABLE AIRCRAFT
CONCLUSION: IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE WAS NOT A UFO SIGHTING BUT RATHER PROBABLY A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS ILLUMINATED BY THE ORANGE GLOW OF THE SUN SETTING BEHIND IT. THE TRAIL COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOME FORM OF EXHAUST OR CONTRAIL PRODUCED BY THE AIRCRAFT.
