SUBJECT: Ad Hoc Committee on Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)

TO: Members of Committee

1. You are invited to attend a meeting of the USAF Scientific Advisory Committee on UFOs at the Foreign Technology Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, on 3 January 1966. An agenda is attached (Atch #1).

2. In 1948, the Air Force initiated Project Blue Book to determine whether UFOs constituted (1) a threat to the security of the United States, and (2) whether any undue scientific or technical research. The objectives of the Ad Hoc Committee are to review the procedures and findings of Project Blue Book and to advise the Air Force as to any improvements that should be made in the program in order to carry out the Air Force's original responsibility. Correspondence for the meeting as well as other pertinent documentation is attached (Atch 2, 3, and 4).

3. Quarters for attendees will be available at the Wright-Patterson Visiting Officers' Quarters. Please let me know your earliest convenience when you plan to arrive so that lodging can be reserved. My phone is Area Code 697-8345/697-8545.
