HOLKE --2

The following responses to my questions were obtained:
1. Temperature was well above freezing (estimate 40'F).
2. Pictures of the ice were taken by reporters from the local newspaper, the Boechronicler Press.
3. An unusual odor was observed in the sighting.
4. The likelihood of a prank being played was rejected by Holke because of the large area affected.
5. It is reported that no samples of pond water had been taken.
6. No power lines are in the vicinity of the sighting.
7. No unusual impressions or physical evidence, other than the frozen pond, were found in the area.
8. A Nike missile launch site is the only military installation on the island.
9. A number of commercial radio transmitters are on the island.
10. 15:12 and another officer, Capt. Mailman, returned to the gravel pit area at 1 p.m. Sunday afternoon (11 hours after the sighting). The ice was approximately 1/2 thawed at this time.
11. A child's visit was made to the area at 1 p.m. on Monday, February 19. The ice was gone at that time. A large number of people had been to the gravel pit since the sighting and had heavily tracked the area. Several of the visitors had taken samples of the ice here to put in their freezers.

INTERVIEWER'S COMMENT

Holke was cooperative and appeared to be genuinely puzzled by the incident. His responses to my questions were carefully considered and, for the most part, concise. I would rate him as a good observer.
