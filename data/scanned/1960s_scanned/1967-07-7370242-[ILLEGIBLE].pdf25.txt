Contact was made with Lt. Ides, Corpus Christi NAS, Texas in regards to a sighting of a UFO. Lt. Ides called The NAS to report an object traveling down the coastline which appeared to be about 1/2 to 3/4 mile off the coast.

The object was about 130-150 feet off the water and appeared to be oval shaped and moving in his sighting. It looked liked it was level with his craft which was at an altitude of about 2,000 feet.
