There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page is as follows:

(1) The Air Force should capitalize on the belief of 50 million Americans in the existence of UFOs.

(2) Announce and maintain a scientific investigation policy to satisfy public interest.

(3) Initiate positive programs oriented at establishing contact with extraterrestrials.

We must establish a new image for Project Blue Book and we believe this can be done by acceptance of these recommendations.
