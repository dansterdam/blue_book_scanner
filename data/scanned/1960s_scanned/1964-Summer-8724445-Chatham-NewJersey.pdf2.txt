Dear Miss-

This is in reply to your letter concerning aerial observations which you have made.

At the time of the sighting, an investigation would have been under the Jurisdiction of the Air Force. It is not feasible to attempt an investigation at this time, over 10 years later.

I am enclosing the current report on Project Blue Book. I hope this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

John S. McClymont
