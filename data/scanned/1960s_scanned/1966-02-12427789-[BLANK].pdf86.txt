4. Suggestions for Further Exploration
In case additional information on the possible availability or the actual history of the specific sample is desired by the Air Force, or by some other appropriate agency, we suggest the following contacts:

A. Domestic Paper Manufacturers
There are several companies in this country which are capable of making products very similar to the unknown. We feel that discussion with these companies, including an opportunity for them to examine the sample, may be helpful to determine whether or not any of these companies do, in fact, manufacture a product identical to the unknown. Companies active in this particular segment of the paper industry would be able to comment on the present status of domestic production versus imports of products of this type and the probable channels of distribution. For primary contacts we suggest the following:

John A. Manning Paper Co., Inc., P. O. Box 328, Troy,
New York (C. E. Lanyon)
C. H. Dexter & Sons, Inc., 100 Canal St., Windsor Locks,
Conn. (Geo. D. Knight)
Crystal Tissue Co., Middletown, Ohio
Peter J. Schweitzer Division of Kimberly-Clark Corporation, 230 Park Avenue, New York, New York Delsta Paper Operations Division, Celotex Insulation Division, Pisgah Forest, North Carolina

In turn, discussion with each of these companies may develop further contacts worth investigating.

B. Users and/or Distributors
At least two types of organizations would be interested in handling papers comparable to the unknown: for lens tissue and for use as stencil tissue. We suggest that the following be contacted as converters or distributors of paper for lens tissue:
