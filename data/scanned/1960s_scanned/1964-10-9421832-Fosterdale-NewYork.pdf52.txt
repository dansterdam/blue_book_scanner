The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that describes the contents of the report, which includes three 8" x 10" photos, one 3" x 5" photo, and three negatives.

The text in the document says:

FOSTERDALE, N.Y.
31 OCT 64 - CASE INCLUDES
three (3) 8" x 10" photos,
one (1) 3" x 5" photo,
three (3) negatives
