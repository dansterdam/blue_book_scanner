DATE OF
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION Syracuse, New York DATE 26 October 1966
PHOTOGRAPHY
AF IR QUALITY Fair
P NRS One 35mm colored slide and one 3.5 inch by 5 inch colored print.
1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order Number 67-135 submitted by MOTR, which requested an analysis be made on the submitted photo slide and print which were reported at Syracuse, New York, 26 October 1966.
2. ANALYSIS: The cause of the image on the film cannot be positively determined. Elements of one silhouetted disc or light surrounded by several small specks are part of the image and not scratches on the emulsion. There is also a second, indistinct image of somewhat different and possibly printed image patterns. Also, small bubble patterns do not appear on the color print. Suggestive of secondary effects, rather than a primary light source. The original color material is not available. Without this material, the possible causes of the imagery cannot be made.
