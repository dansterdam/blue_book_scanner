Text extracted from the document:

Please to consider that this is strictly confidential fact that many facts have been collected that indicate it is no longer tenable for official management to refuse to acknowledge the reality of UFOs and the continuing flow of highly reliable reports from competent and trained observers. Failure to consider this information is not only a disservice to the taxpayers who pay for the management of this program, but may also carry serious political risks. Dark diecast Delavan (unreadable name) material harbor and the retical has been in dark and unapplanable for some 2 weeks now. The vehicle again has taken a report that it has been sited (sic) about 5 miles west of Bunkie, Louisiana, on August 9, 1965. The vehicle was hovering about 50 feet above the ground and was observed for about 10 minutes before it made a rapid departure in a SW direction. The observer was an adult male, sober, reliable and reportedly has a good reputation in the community. There is no reason to doubt the veracity of his report. Please forward this information to proper authorities for immediate consideration.
