Dear Mrs. [redacted],

Reference your recent observation of an alleged unidentified flying object (UFO). 

A study of the submitted information did not result in a positive identification. The red, green, and yellow-white lights are very consistent with that of an aircraft's exterior navigation and position lights. Unusual aircraft lighting configurations have in the past been responsible for numerous UFO observations.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. The latest edition of the report on Project Blue Book is enclosed.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch Division
