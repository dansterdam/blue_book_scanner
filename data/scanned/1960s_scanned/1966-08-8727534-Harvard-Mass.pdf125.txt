Gentlemen:

At 10:10 on the night of August 8, 1966, near Shutesbury, Vt., an object of the first magnitude was observed with the unaided eye. It moved silently and generally in a zig-zag direction. At 10:20, the object moved away rapidly at a sharp angle from the direction it had been traveling. 

Could you please tell me what this object was, or if not, could you tell me if you had other reports of it?

Thank you very much.

Sincerely yours,
