Dear Anyone,
On September 7, 1967, while in Van Cortlandt Park at 9:05, I saw a UFO. It was traveling at 500 feet (estimate) above the ground, in a NE direction. I observed this UFO and there passed it had a four light arrangement, the fourth light came on every second.
We could easily discern the metal between the four lights and this other thing reminded me of what I've seen in movies. This was reported to the BASE.
The UFO Then put on a burst of speed, disappearing in the N-SE direction, at TOP SPEED falling the object. The UFO Then put on a burst of speed, disappearing in the N-SE direction, at TOP SPEED falling the object.
A few seconds later another person came over to our bench. He then screamed "I saw up there!" We were followed where the man pointing and saw the same UFO preceding 1/2 miles the Hustler following it. He was not here the first time.
(Remainder of text is unclear due to redaction, but it appears to describe additional details about the sighting)
Nobody believes us, but we knew what we saw.
Sincerely yours,
