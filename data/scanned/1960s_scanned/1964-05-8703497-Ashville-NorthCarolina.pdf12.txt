The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate UFO sightings. The text on the page appears to be a letter discussing reports of unidentified flying objects in the area of a school. The author expresses their belief that the reports are not a joke and asks for a reasonable explanation, while also stating that the reports have not been disclosed to anyone except those involved.

Dear Sirs:
Enclosed is part of a series of reports which have been given to me by several students here at school. 
These reports concern the sighting of various unidentified
flying objects over or in the approximate area of the
school grounds.
I hope that you can find some reasonable explanation
for this other than the one which seems apparent, but
I am inclined to think, with several other students,
that no other explanation can be found. I assure you
that none of this has been done as a joke, because we
feel that this is not a joking matter. The only incident
which we have disclosed to anyone except those involved
is Incident #1. The reaction to this by most of the
school is to be expected. They think we have spring
fever and that it is all a big joke. I can not say
I blame them due to what my reactions would be if I
were them.
We have talked this over among ourselves and I
have been persuaded to give you the whole report,
complete , as is. The reason for hesitation is due
to the fact that this story might appear to be partially
doctored up. I assure that this is not the case. We
have not made this report except for the reason to
give you a true report of the happenings here over
these days. I can also assure you that the students
who gave me these reports are not making them up.
