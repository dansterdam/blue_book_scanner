"Mystery Satellite" Sighted At
Hong Kong, 9 July 1962. Local resident R. L. Hobson reported that he had
seen an unusual object in the sky which appeared as a bright white light, twice in two hours on the
evening of 9 July. The "Russian and American satellites" take,
according to Hobson, about 15 minutes to cross the sky. Russian and American
satellites take roughly 20 plus minutes
for transit.
