SAFOINGG/JAD/79079/27 Jun 67

Jun 8 1967

Dear Sir:

This replies to your recent correspondence in which you mentioned your unidentified observation of June 17, 1966 and subsequent photographs.

The delay in reporting your observation prevents a comprehensive investigation since details are normally destroyed after one year.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified object, please contact the nearest air force starting immediately.

For your information I have attached a copy of "Project Blue Book", the Air Force UFO program. Your interest in our program is appreciated.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Community Relations Division
