The image contains a black and white photograph of what appears to be a page from an official document, likely related to a UFO report. The page contains several questions and spaces for responses, indicating that it is a form or questionnaire related to a UFO sighting or observation. There are no human faces or identities visible in the image.

The text found in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Faded away
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes - No - Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what:
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes - No - Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what:
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound - very still, b. Color - brilliant blue
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The document appears to be part of a larger set of records related to a UFO sighting, likely from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO reports.
