14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
Brightness of the object oval colored
seemed to attract our attention as
startlingly intense an initial impression.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
The object oval vanished slowly while
the "segmented rays" then faded very
slowly, and no noise was described. The
sighting then ended abruptly as it was
observed in a clear night sky.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
[NO] NOT DESCRIBED.
