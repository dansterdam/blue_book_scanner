SUBJECT: UFO Report (Mr. ....)

TO: DL

1. As requested, please find attached copy of a report to ATIC (AFSC) from Mr....
regarding several UFOs seen by him.

2. Recent sighting of several UFOs, probably due to phosphorescent meteors or other phenomenon, has prompted this report. The objects of light were at a high altitude and their movement was erratic, according to the report.

3. The object sighted by Mr. ... in her final observation has been in the past the subject of considerable controversy. The validity of this report has been questioned; however, it is supported by the statement of an independent witness, according to the report.
