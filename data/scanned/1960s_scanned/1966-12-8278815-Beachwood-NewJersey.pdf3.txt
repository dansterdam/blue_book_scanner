Dear sir,

On the night of December 7, I sighted three unidentified objects in the sky. I reported them to your officer and I completed and filled out a form and returned it to you.

In what I believe to be the interests of your Air Force scientific findings, and in order to make certain that you may have all the data necessary to properly evaluate this sighting, I am still interested in this matter and would like to know if you found out anything more after I returned the form.

I would appreciate any information you could tell me about my sighting. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
