Dear Colonel Evans:

We have completed our examination of the material submitted with your letter of May 5. Microscopic analyses show the presence of fat, starch, buckwheat hulls, wheat bran, and soybean hulls. The material is predominantly buckwheat. Bacteriological examination and measurement of radioactivity gave results which are consistent with the cereal origin.

Remainder of the cake is being returned, herewith. 

Sincerely yours,
M. R. Galbraith
