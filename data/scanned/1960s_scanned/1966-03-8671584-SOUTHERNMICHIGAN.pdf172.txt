the home of _____ County Civil Defense Director and operator of the _____ Funeral Home. He has a pilots license, been in the Air Force, and is a very knowledgeable and seemingly efficient person. I talked with him at length about the sighting. Mrs. _____ wind taken the first call, a report from the girls' dormitory, to the effect that there were blue, red and white lights visible to the east from the dormitory near the ground. _____ went to the back roof of his house and for 10 minutes scanned the skies and could see nothing. He did see a white light in the SW which he stated was stationary at first, and then appeared to change azimuth from 210 to 270 degrees. His wife and some others observed it for about 20 minutes. He said it wasn't a star, and not an aircraft because it remained in the field of the binoculars for five minutes. But he saw nothing in the area of the sky to the northeast and east. This was reported to the girls but they called back at _____ and stated, in effect,"sorry to bother your, don't want you to think we are crackpots, but this is coming down" - it was straight down of the dormitory and probably is miles away, they stated. Van Horn called the State Police as well as the city police who arrived shortly, investigated the area and reported there was nothing to be seen. Because the girls continued to report lights, decided to go to the dormitory. He saw Mrs. _____ housemother at the dormitory, who took them to the second floor of the dormitory. They went to the room where Miss _____ girls were. The girls had the room dark and windows open and were looking down towards a swampy depression in the country side. _____ observed the lights then himself for the first time.
