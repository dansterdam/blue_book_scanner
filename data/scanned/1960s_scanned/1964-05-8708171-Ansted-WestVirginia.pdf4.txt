I can not recall the date because so much time had elapsed since it had happened. It was about 4:00 AM, official time, as I was a big part of the aircraft in this sitter. The reason I reported this was because it was a fact that was not in the story & also thought that it might be important as a possible booster or a possible boost in boston since it was so huge.
