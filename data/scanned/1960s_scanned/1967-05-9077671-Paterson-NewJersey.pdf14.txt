Gentlemen,

I am writing a report concerning report # 220, submitted by myself. 

This report involves an incident which occurred over Paterson, New Jersey. The object I observed was moving at a very high rate of speed and seemed to be flying between my home and Dover City. 

The object I observed did not shine as a regular aircraft light. It seemed to have a dull orange color. It made no sound that I could hear and there was no trail of any kind. The object changed direction in the sky continuously and seemed to be under intelligent control. I was not able to identify the object and no aircraft or satellites were observed in the area at that time.

It seemed to be continuing for sometime with no change in movement than suddenly it disappeared.

I would appreciate any information you could provide regarding this incident.

Sincerely,
