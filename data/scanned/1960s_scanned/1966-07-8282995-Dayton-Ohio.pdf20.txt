The image appears to show a page from a Project Blue Book report. There is no photograph present on this page. As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Glanced away and it was gone, reappeared, gone again.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound 2-3 seconds
b. Color -- bright light

18. We wish to know the angular size. Held a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. 
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[Drawing of object with arrow]
Object moved fast, then stopped & moved again, disappearing in the distance.
