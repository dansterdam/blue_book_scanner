There is no photograph present in this particular page.

OCR text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was shown, then place a "B" on the same curved line to show how low the object was shown. Place a "C" above the object to show how far away you thought the object was. Place a "D" below the object to show how close you thought the object came.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
