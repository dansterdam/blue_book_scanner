There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a form with questions about the sighting of a UFO object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):  Yes  No  Don't Know.  If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):  Yes  No  Don't Know.  If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color - Glowing white to yellow. Occasionally a short red streak.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
