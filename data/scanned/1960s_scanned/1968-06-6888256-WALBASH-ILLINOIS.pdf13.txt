WE WERE BOTH LOOKING AT STARS WITH TELESCOPE
WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A PLANET. WHEN TRIED
TO PUT TELESCOPE (95-POWER WITH 4-FOOT PAPON) ON IT, IT WAS MOVING. THEN, WHILE FRIEND (LEN ABESMANN)
WAS TRYING TO PUT TELESCOPES ON IT, I RAND TO CAR AND
TOOK BINOCULARS (7-POWER) AND PUT MY ELBOWS OUT, SO I
WOULD IT JIGGLE (BINOCULARS WERE ALREADY FOCUSED) AND
THEN LOOKED AT IT SECOND SIGHTING. MOVED FAST FROM EAST
TO WEST LOOKED THROUGH BINOCULARS,IT WAS THE SAME OBJECT. 
DISMISSED IT AS PROBABLE CLOUD, BEFORE FIRST SIGHTING, IT WAS
SILHOUETTED STAR SHAPED OBJECT TO NORTHWEST.
