(Time stopped me at 10 seconds.) (Case was about 10 seconds long.) This was the most unusual case occurred any of the witnesses seen a thing. No stars appeared brighter or changed in any way. No planes of satellites were seen. What it was that was seen can only say 5 miles away a small white light glowing like a star. It started to get brighter and brighter. Its was at first a stationary object then it began to move. It hovered over the trees for a few seconds. Then it started to move very fast in the trees and out of sight in few seconds. Witnesses said was looking very strange. One did get up and stepped a few feet to get a better look but the light disappeared as it went behind the trees. Two of the witnesses followed the light a short distance in a car but never seen it again. As to identification they are puzzled. Each one thought the other might know what it was. They can only say it was the strangest thing they ever seen and they know of no simple explanation for it. The air force was notified but they had no report at that time of any unidentified flying object in that area. That's about all the details I can give you. I don't know quite what to make of it. It was reported to the air force and I am passing the report along to you as received. If you have any other questions please let me know.
