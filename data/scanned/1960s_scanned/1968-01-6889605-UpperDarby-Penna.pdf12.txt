The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the top is a compass rose with directions labeled. The smaller sketches on the bottom show two landscape scenes, one with a person standing on a road and the other depicting a distant landscape.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE PLACED "N" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "V" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "V" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN THE FIRST AND LAST SIGHTING. ALSO PLACE AN APPROXIMATE ESTIMATE OF THE ANGLE IT MOVED CLOCKWISE OR COUNTERCLOCKWISE FROM THE FIRST AND LAST SIGHTING.
