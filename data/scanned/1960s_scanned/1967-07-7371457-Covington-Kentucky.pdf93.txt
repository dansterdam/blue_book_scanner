The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that describes a series of sightings.

Text from the document:

"Then, spaced up suddenly and disappeared in the distance. It was a clear night and stars were visible. This was not a star, meteor, or aircraft.

All these sightings have much in common:

All four were similar on the same object.

All four were silent and did not resemble conventional aircraft or helicopters, but did seem to be intelligently controlled.

With the exception of the last sighting, the objects all followed approximately the same course and disappeared at approximately the same speed and all landed in approximately the same spot.

The last sighting was following the opposite course of the others (east instead of west) and appeared to be either smaller or farther away.

All were sighted between 10:15 P.M. and 11:15 P.M."
