The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed or handwritten document from the Project Blue Book records.

As an OCR system, I will output the following text found in the document:

At the same time I gasped and "Paul" jerked his head up and followed 2 cylindrical white objects flying at a tremendous rate of speed. The objects came out of the corner of my eye, and "Paul" seeing the thing said, a V-formation, pointed part of the formations pointing in the direction of the first object. The thing descended, not like a glider, but rather with a bounding motion, like a rock skipping over water. This most peculiar lack of it and its motion--two or three seconds,or perhaps only one,or less than three seconds,if not less.(more like two seconds,but it is different--motion more like a graceful glide."There was absolutely no sound,what so ever.

"Paul" also saw it for the greater part of its flight. His report cracked out any lap ression.

I do not try to explain it. I merely state that I saw something,which in detail I described and "Paul" saw the same,and I do state that this report is correct and wish it to go down on the record as such.
