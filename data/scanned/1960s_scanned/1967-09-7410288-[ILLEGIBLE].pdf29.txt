The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on what appears to be an old document or report. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will transcribe the text found in the document:

"That Typical siting I suppose is out 
in the West, perhaps over Arizona or 
Nevada or New Mexico.  You know 
any sighting will be reported as of a 
disc over New Mexico or Arizona or 
Nevada. A.B. Hendrickson 10-5-57
