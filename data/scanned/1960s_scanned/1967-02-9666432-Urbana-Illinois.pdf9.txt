STATEMENT

Urbana, Illinois, student, University of Illinois, age 18.

"On the 25th of February, 1967, at about 2:00 hours, I left the auditorium. As I was walking across the campus, I noticed a strange light in the sky. It was a bright light, but there was no definite shape just a light. It seemed to be about 700 feet in the air. It was there for about 2 minutes and then it disappeared. I did not hear any sound. There was no cloud cover and it was a clear night. I could not see any lights or any definite shape, just a light."
