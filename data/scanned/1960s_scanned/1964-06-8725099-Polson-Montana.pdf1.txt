OBJECT II was reported hovering at an apparent high altitude and resembled an ECHO Satellite, which characteristically shows a slowing and dimming of the reflected sunlight at times. Observers report the object seemed to accelerate and then appeared to be obscured momentarily, then reappeared again. It then seemed to veer away at an apparent high speed and disappearance.

CONCLUSION: 
1. ECHO II  
2. AIRCRAFT

No other observations accompanying the one described were received, and the apparent abrupt turn of the object does not conclusively indicate anything other than the normal characteristics of an ECHO Satellite. The description provided is consistent with this conclusion.
