TRANSCRIPTION:

There were a number of people who saw the object. It was described as about 60 feet in diameter and it was silver in color and it had a bluish halo around it. The object made no noise at all as it passed overhead. It was traveling at a very high speed, much faster than any known aircraft. It appeared to be circular in shape and it had no projections or wings. It seemed to glow with a bluish light. The object was observed for approximately 30 seconds as it passed overhead and then it seemed to disappear into the distance at a tremendous speed. The witnesses stated that they had never seen anything like this object before and they were quite perplexed by what they had observed. They indicated that they had no explanation for what they had seen. The Air Force investigated this case but was unable to identify the object.
