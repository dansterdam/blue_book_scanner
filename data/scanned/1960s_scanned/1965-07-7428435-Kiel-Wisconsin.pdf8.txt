UFO Report: Mrs. ___, Kiel, Wisconsin, phone call.

Sorry I can't identify this for you, but the woman's story was simple and straightforward. She saw a brilliant light from the southwest to eastern horizons in the sky, and a small red light on the object that was as big as Keno. She said, she would have mistaken it for Keno, except that this was pulsating rapidly. However, even if this were a possible explanation, it did not flash on and off like a flashlight being switched on and off, as I don't know where we were.

One of the outstanding things in this sighting is the repetition of the fact that the object followed the circle of the horizon and did not cross the sky in a straight line. I neglected to ask her how close to the zenith it passed, but will drop her a note and ask.

This sighting is similar to the McKeesport, Pennsylvania sighting which was made the previous night, except that those lights were quite slow moving. Just a case of too many lights in the sky that don't belong there.
