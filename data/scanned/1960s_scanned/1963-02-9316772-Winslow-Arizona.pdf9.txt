NOV-DEC 65

Alberti (Province of Buenos Aires)
According to the Flying Saucer Review report, at 6:30 p.m. of that same day, they were surprised as they were standing in a field, when a luminous object of elliptical form appeared in the sky traveling at high speed. It stopped at a short distance from the ground. They stopped and got out to look at it. The object remained stationary for a few minutes. It then resumed its fast speed and disappeared. The witnesses stated that, judging by the size and brightness of the object as seen from the ground, they estimate it to have been about 15 meters in diameter and emitting an intense white light. They had the impression that the object had turned off its light. The witnesses rushed to pick up the paper to have printed a news article, but could not find a copy of it.
