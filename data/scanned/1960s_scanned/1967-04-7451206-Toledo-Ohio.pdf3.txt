COULD YOU HEAR ANY SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHENOMENON? DESCRIBE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PHENOMENON AND OTHER KNOWN OBJECTS OR PHENOMENA.

The observed object was dimly visible and appeared to "descend" to a certain distance where a horizontal (sideways) movement was observed. The object seemed to be opaque or dark in color and did not exhibit any discernible light sources or pulsing illumination. There appeared to be differences in the observed object compared to known aircraft or other phenomena, such as the slower and more horizontal movement pattern. However, no definitive conclusions could be drawn about the nature of the observed phenomenon.

A. DID THE PHENOMENON DISTURB THE GROUND OR LEAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE?  LIES      NO.
