The light was bright and very unusual. It behav move rapidly and changed direction rapidly. at times seemed to stop more or less and look back toward the source of the light, and became dimmer, as if gathering power or speed. The light was a definite white light, very bright compared to stars or any other objects I have seen, and seemed to move with an intelligence, hovering, popping up, and then moving very rapidly out of sight. The movement was most unusual.
