The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. It contains a compass rose diagram and two sketches depicting sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena.

The compass rose diagram provides instructions on how to use a compass to indicate the direction of a sighting. The two sketches show different perspectives of a sighting, likely from an observer's point of view.

Extracting the text from the document:

AS NOW INDICATED, YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE TWO POINTS WITH A STRAIGHT LINE. WHETHER THE LINE APPEARS TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LANG IN SKETCH.
