The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a questionnaire with written responses.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It appeared at the times mentioned suddenly, and then as it had some slowly.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One):
Yes     No     Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what: It moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One):

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: No sound.
b. Color: a bluish-white, with blue-green in the front segments.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or one's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the hand of the match. If you can perform this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? -- about 1 1/2 to 1 inch was seen on July 6. Second on July 7.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
