Dear Sirs:

I have heard that you have stopped investigating unidentified flying objects. 

Since you are not investigating them could you please send me a copy of the questions-hair's that you send to people?

Do you still get reports from cranpots about sacting "flying saucers"?

Thank you very much.

Yours truly,
