The text in the document is as follows:

These object showed descent from the horizon - apparently coming from a westerly direction - toward the ground - of a very bright intensely luminous appearance - The object "went out" near the ground - This was repeated 3-4 times - the object was luminous at all times - With all this - no sound was heard - only the sound of the wind - We saw it about 6:30 pm while driving in the car - it was near the horizon - and about 30 degrees up from the horizon - It was moving perpendicular to the car - it seemed to be about 15-20 miles away - The passage of time seems to have been no more than a minute - The day was clear and a little windy. R.M. aged 29 - Housewife - residing at 3701 S. Bannock Littleton Colorado - I had no idea what this object could be - but it did not seem to be an airplane or any known type of aircraft.
