"... and concerning sightings and incidence observed by trained observers in scientific fields. In this connection, it is noted that in Niagara Falls, New York, on 8 September 1966, an illuminated object was observed moving in a erratic manner across the sky and seen by a number of people. This object was sighted at approximately 11:00 p.m., 8 September 1966, and was seen by a meteorologist and others at this location. The object left no trail and moved with great speed and precision. Efforts to track the object with radar were not successful. This incident would be of interest and concern to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as being another sighting by trained and responsible observers. Therefore, this information is provided for your consideration and any action deemed appropriate."
