Dear sirs:

This address has been given me as appropriate for the present report, so please forward if so indicated. 

As a college professor of many years I have been concerned regarding the mysterious objects which have been frequently reported by observers. The attached "notes" of 2 local observers convince me that they will interest someone else. I wish them to fall into proper hands.

Very truly yours,

Dean of Faculty
