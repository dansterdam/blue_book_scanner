Seattle--Another Fire Ball 
On May 8, 1962 at 0215 hours, residents in Seattle were startled by the sight of a huge yellow ball of fire streaking silently northward through the sky over that city. The object was estimated to have been about the size of a full moon and was described as casting a bright yellow-white light. According to the report, it moved very rapidly from the southwest to the northeast before disappearing. It was sighted again a few minutes later over Tacoma, Washington. It was reported to be approximately 35 to 40 miles north of Seattle when last observed. There was speculation that the sighting was connected with a similar incident which occurred several weeks earlier in which a bright object was seen over the Seattle, Tacoma, and Bremerton areas. 
The first sighting yesterday at Jupiter-Washington occurred. The object was observed to emit a series of flashes or pulses of light before diminishing and disappearing. The sighting was reported to local police and representatives of the U.S. Air Force. Witnesses in Cambridge, Mass. later confirmed that some sort of object had been sighted in the Seattle area shortly before noon on May 8, 1962.
