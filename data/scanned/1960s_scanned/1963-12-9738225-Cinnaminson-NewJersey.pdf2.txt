APRO Member Sights
Green "Jet" In Jersey

At 5:20 p.m. on December 13, 1963, APRO member Michael J. Campione saw what he described as a flying object resembling an Air Force jet trainer, but which glowed with a light green phosphorescent color. To be more specific, the color was close to "spring green," a classification of crayon used in children's coloring books. All around the outline of the object was a fuzzy luminous halo. The report states that the two sightings over Long Island in September and the present instance are very similar.

The shape of the UFO was that of an elongated diamond. Two narrow wing-like projections extended out from either side of the fuselage in the same relative position as wings on a conventional aircraft. On each "wing tip" was what resembled a conventional wingtip fuel tank. The machine showed no evidence of a tail assembly.

Campione estimated that the distance this object traveled was about 8 miles. The estimated altitude was 3,000 feet. Campione said the UFO passed directly over the observer. Its estimated attitude was 3,000 feet and it made no noise.
