DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES FEB. 3-9, 1969
The contents in this publication are a product of the Weather Bureau, a division of the Environmental Science Services Administration, Department of Commerce. The charts are for one-day analysis and forecasts. They are produced by the National Meteorological Center and cover the North American continent and adjacent oceans. The symbols used on the weather charts are explained in the text.
The Surface Weather Map presents a synoptic-scale analysis of the surface weather pattern as of 7:00 a.m. EST. The tracks of well-defined highs and lows, shown by dashed lines, designate the centers of these systems. Frontal positions, indicated by appropriate frontal symbols, are also shown, as well as the wind direction and speed. Isotherms of temperature are drawn solid, while isotherms of dewpoint are drawn dashed. In addition, the height of the 1000-500 mb thickness contours are labeled in decameters. The flight contours are shown as solid lines and represent the height in decameters of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.
