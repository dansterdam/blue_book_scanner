When you came down here, you told your mother that you were going hunting. And you had your camera with you.
My BB gun.
A camera and a BB gun. You were going to shoot the UFO with a BB gun. 
All right, you came down the highway. Your mother -
I just walked down the road.
You walked down the road from your house with your camera and your gun. And you went all alone. Did you see anyone else in this area when?
No, I didn't see anyone else when I came down here.
How far is this from your home, Dave?
I don't know.
How long does it take you to walk it generally?
About an hour.
About an hour.
I think about an hour.
Is this an area that you come out quite frequently when you get a chance to get out?
Sometimes I come out here when, well, you know, sometimes when I got nothing to do, I think about things. And you say I come out here quite frequently?
But it's sort of a favorite area to come and sort of hike around here, isn't it? By gosh, I just stopped in this thing. And I attack it more than this one. Are you sure that this is the bus stop down here?
I'm positive that it was that one.
You're positive that it was the little one? Why don't we go on.
Story, you first noticed this object when?
