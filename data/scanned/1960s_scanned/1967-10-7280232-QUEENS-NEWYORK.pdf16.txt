The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch of the observed object or objects. The sketch depicts an oval-shaped object with some distinctive features labeled.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
By fading away until I could no longer see it. There was no abrupt disappearance.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (NO) Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (NO) Don't Know. 
If you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound The sound seemed to be a humming or buzzing noise
b. Color Grayish white in color, metallic looking
c. Size or apparent size Smaller than a plane or helicopter but not small

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the hand of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
One quarter of the diameter of the object was covered.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The provided sketch depicts an oval-shaped object with a slight indentation on one side, as well as a directional arrow indicating the object's direction of movement.
