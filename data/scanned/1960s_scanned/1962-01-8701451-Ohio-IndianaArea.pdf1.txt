This case involves several bright green objects with long tails moving very rapidly across the sky. Durations ranged from 1 to 6 sec. All sightings took place at night during a period of 1 to 2 min. Witnesses describe the objects as being very bright and fiery in appearance. The objects were viewed by both military and civilian observers. This sighting is richest on the third-order shower and other bright meteors (or the fireball class) which were not of the shower.
