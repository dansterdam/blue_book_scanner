NIGAP MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING SUBCOMITTEE

22 Excell Ct. 

Wentham, Massachusetts

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTINGS - EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS - APRIL 1966  
DATE: 25 June 1966
FROM: Raymond E. Fowlor, CAPT. USAF RETIRED, NIGAP MASS SUBCOM.
TO: NICAP Washington, D.C.
ATTENTION: Richard Hall, Assistant Director

Enclosed is a report from Massachusetts, consisting of UFO sightings by inspection and date for the period 10 April 1966. This report, submitted to me, contains data which may be of interest to your organization.

Highlights were the 12-22-66 sightings reported by several observers. These reported objects were under observation for some 40-45 minutes and exhibited extreme maneuverability. The 1-22-66 Middleboro report and the 4-10-66 Weymouth sighting cases contained useful data as well.

This SUBCOM are included in this package to supplement those already in your possession. The advertising plane was not reported as an UFO. In most cases, the sighting appeared to be caused by natural phenomena.

The 1956 Waldoboro, Maine, UFO sighting from the nearby town of Newcastle, Maine, is enclosed as an unusual case. Two 'power like towers' and signs the New Hampshire-Massachusetts reports refer to a 'tower like' object, which was observed to land and then depart slowly in the Massachusetts and New Hampshire area. In intensity, this sighting ranked quite high among those received by this SUBCOM.

Most of the UFOs reported were oval-shaped and carrying various colored lights. Some shone bright white light. Instances of 3 to 5 lights were commonplace. The probability is again, that natural phenomena accounted for a number of the sightings. Unusual maneuverability and performance were observed in a number of the cases.
