I received the attached newsclip on 2/18 and called the personnel police who in turn advised the name of the witness' company officer. He had received the same newsclip and the company's security people were notified. An investigation was made. The gas & electric company records showed Mobil Oil Company (622-6592) had investigated the unusual activity of lights in the Dedham area and stated that: The lights were a new booster station under construction by the company and these lights were used for security lighting at the site. The security guard on duty at the time saw the object at approximately 8:30 PM and called his superior who confirmed the sighting. The guard was told that the lights were from the new booster station and was satisfied that this explained the sighting. Some 9 days later, however, this same guard reported that at about 10:30 PM on the same night, he again saw the same or a similar object while on duty and reported it to his superior. Thus there appears to be some inconsistency in the explanations offered. The observer (witness) remained convinced that he had seen an unidentified flying object and that the explanation offered regarding the new booster station lights was not adequate. No vapor trail, no sound.
