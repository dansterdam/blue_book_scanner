OBSERVER: JAMES E. STEPHENS
DATE OF OBSERVATION: AUGUST 8, 1962
LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA
TIME OF OBSERVATION: 2100 HOURS
DATE AND PLACE RECEIVED: AUGUST 8, 1962, ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA
COMMENTS: AT 2100 HOURS ON AUGUST 8, 1962, I OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE SKY OVER ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA. THE OBJECT WAS WHITE IN COLOR, ROUND IN SHAPE, AND APPEARED TO BE HOVERING IN THE SKY. IT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES BEFORE ACCELERATING RAPIDLY AND DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW. I HAVE NEVER OBSERVED ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE AND AM UNSURE OF WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN. I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THIS INCIDENT TO THE AUTHORITIES.
