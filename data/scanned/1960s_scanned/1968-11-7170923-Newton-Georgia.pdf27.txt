out what's behind all this. And I now feel convinced that we won't find out what's behind it unless we attack the problem much more seriously that have so far.

Well, one of these serious people I'm talking about that will actually sit down and seem very interested in this brought the Post, I believe it was Dec. 17, 1966. It had an article by you in it, and I found this article to be most interesting. Now as a matter of fact, you might have that Post handy; if you do, if you'll look on the front cover . .

I don't have it handy, but I remember the front cover pretty well.

There's, I think it's an artist's conception, of two UFO's. If you will take the largest of those two and blot out the green lights that seem to be around the oval, you pretty well have the last sighting that I saw.

You say, last sighting, what do you mean?

Well, just before it disappeared.

Oh, I see, the last sighting of this.

Right, the last picture I saw/before it went out of sight. It was a large oval shaped orangish-red color.

Yea?, he was very, the Sheriff's dept. here in Albany was very interested in the situation. As a matter of fact, while I filling out a preliminary report for them, they called the local television station, and, oh, I've gotten some wonderful publicity. The TV crew came down and filmed an interview, the local newspaper was very nice to put a very nice writeup in the paper.

Well, I'm very glad that you didn't get ridiculed by them.
