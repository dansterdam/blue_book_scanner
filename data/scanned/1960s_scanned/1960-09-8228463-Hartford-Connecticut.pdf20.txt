SUBJECT: "Woodridge" - fall of suspected gravitationally oriented material

Dear Professor Brown:

Thank you for your letter of October 28, 1960, and the additional information concerning the "Woodridge" fall of suspected gravitationally oriented material which you wrote to me about. I appreciate your concern in bringing this matter to my attention.

This subject has not yet been physically examined, and I regret that the equipment required for a more comprehensive investigation is not currently available. However, I will endeavor to keep you informed as matters develop.

We are confronted with the apparent fact that material has fallen from the sky which does not conform to any commonly recognized meteorological or accidental processes. Even though this material may prove to be of natural origin, the implications are nonetheless significant if it is found to be of extraterrestrial derivation. I would urge that the utmost discretion be exercised, both in the handling of physical specimens and in the dissemination of information, until the matter can be more thoroughly explored.

The continuing changes in patterns of behavior, as exemplified by the recent activity at "Woodridge", is particularly perplexing. These may, in fact, represent a part of a larger pattern of activity not yet fully understood. It is my belief that a thorough, objective study of all available evidence is essential if we are to eliminate the possibility of a technological advance by an intelligence not of this earth.

In reading your letter, there are certain questions or areas of inquiry which occur to me, and I would appreciate your views on these matters.
