The image appears to contain two sketch illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon, and the text instructs the viewer to imagine the object's height above the horizon. The second sketch shows two larger scenes - one with a person standing on a road, and the other with a small object in the sky. The text refers to these as "larger sketch pieces" and asks the viewer to compare the object's position to the examples provided.

In the text, it appears to be instructions or questions related to a UFO sighting report, likely part of the Project Blue Book archives.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch pieces on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch to complete the larger sketch.
