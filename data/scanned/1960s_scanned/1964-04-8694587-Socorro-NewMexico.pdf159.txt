'Flying Bathtub' Seen by Motorist

SOCORRO, April 27 (AP) - Socorro police were called to investigate reports of a strange flying object over the city. Patrolman Lonnie Zamora said he was pursuing a speeding car when he saw a strange, shiny object in the air near the Cary Reservoir.

Zamora said the object landed and two people emerged from it. He said the object was about 15 feet long, oval-shaped, and silvery in color. He said when he approached it, the object took off again and disappeared in the southeast direction. Zamora said it made a roaring sound and scorched the brush and ground where it had landed.

Other officers who joined Zamora said they found indentations in the ground and burned brush at the site.

Heights Resident Saw Object Here

A resident of Socorro said her friend saw a strange silvery object flying over the State Fairgrounds last Thursday afternoon.

The resident, who asked that her name not be published, said the object was definitely not an airplane. She said her friend was traveling south on San Pedro between 3:30 and 4 p.m. when they saw the UFO.

She said the object was more or less egg-shaped, similar to the description given by Officer Lonnie Zamora of an object he saw land near Socorro.
