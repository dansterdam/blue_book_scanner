The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs, but rather has a form with various questions related to the sighting of a UFO object.

Text extracted from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Disappeared behind a mountain.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes. It moved behind a tree.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): No.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None.
b. Color: White.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? The fourth.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any colors, proportions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or wings that may have been noted.
