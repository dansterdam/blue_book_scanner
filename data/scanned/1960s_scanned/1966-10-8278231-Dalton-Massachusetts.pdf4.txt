The elevation of these lights in the sky - we cannot determine this as do not know how to determine this. I do not know how only of his examination.

Just one other point that is probably insignificant is traveling from its field to Boylston. We no longer see these strange + green objects which were to be a line ever a distance of perhaps miles.

I hope that the information will be of some use to you. These things are some sort of craft, that can easily discerned upon them. They are not airplanes, helicopters (too bright to swell for hours at a time), weather balloons (move down below a low cloud). Not planets or stars (altitude too low) and not were their immersion (move around too much). I spot them from wherever they are out. They are not that of a spot about 15/16 miles.

Sincerely,
