There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire with typed responses.

BLINKING

CIRCLE One: Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:                 THE OBJECT MOVED BEHIND A CLOUD 

In front of: CIRCLE One: Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what:

a. Sound: BLINKING

b. Color: WHITE YELLOWISH

We want to know the angular size of the object at arm's length. Hold a match at arm's length so its head just covers the object, then tell us how much of the match's head is covered by the object. 

Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
