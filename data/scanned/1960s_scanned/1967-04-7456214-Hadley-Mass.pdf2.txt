Dear sir,

but what I am only guessing at and what I can't be sure of as an identifying flying object. My father and I were over near Hadley about fifteen minutes and watched home. It was getting dark and we went to Belchertown to get some ice cream and when we came back still no sign of it. We came home and went to bed. The next night about 8:30 the same object appeared and we watched it for about fifteen minutes and then it suddenly disappeared (which was to far away and hidden by trees) and soon the light reappeared but it wasn't the same object. But I do know we were moving at a fast rate of speed. When I saw it I am quite sure it was not a plane, jet, helicopter or anything I have ever seen before. I had not seen one for half a minute.
I looked away to the right and when I looked back it was gone.
going at a terrific speed was quite quikly and returning in the same direction. So far away from where it disappeared that I looked around could not see it again. When the light climbed off the color was blue in the same plane. A notice went out that I saw and to go behind it that the news got out and a bottle view found that it was just gone.
