The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, but it does not contain any photographs. The page is filled with text that appears to be handwritten or typed, possibly a report or record related to the Project Blue Book investigation.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, MISSOURI
9 SEPTEMBER 1964

On 9 September 1964, at approximately 2100 hours, the control tower at Whiteman AFB, Missouri, observed a bright orange or reddish object in the sky, approximately 20,000 feet in altitude. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes. It appeared stationary at first, then began moving in a northerly direction. The object appeared to be metallic in construction and was oval in shape. No other details about the object could be ascertained.

Incident was reported to the 351st Strategic Missile Wing Command Post, and subsequently to the Air Force Headquarters, Offutt AFB, Nebraska.
