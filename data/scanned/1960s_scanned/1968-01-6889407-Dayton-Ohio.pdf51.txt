The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, consisting of a checklist of various UFO-related phenomena and an open-ended question about how the observed object finally disappeared.

The text in the document is as follows:

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE STRAIGHT LINE
SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY
SPEED UP AND QLBIDE
CHANGE COLOR
EMIT SMOKE
CHANGE SHAPE
CLEAR OR FLUORENT
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR
STILL LIKE A SPOT
FLUTTER
FLUTTER ON WOBBLE
WAS THIS YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

WARNIN DOG - NOTICED OBJECT

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
VANISHED

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
