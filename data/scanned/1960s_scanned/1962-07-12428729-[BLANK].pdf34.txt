Unidentified Flying Objects  
18 JUL 1962
AFNIN (Lt Col Dessert)
1. Attached is a proposed reply to Congressman Carl Vinson on the U.S. Air Force Unidentified Flying Objects program. This action is in response to your letter to me on the UFO subject, dated 10 July 1962.
2. Strenuous efforts by Major Keyhoe, a self-styled UFO investigator, to gain Congressional hearings on the Blue Book program have resulted in two Congressional briefings and numerous queries from the members of Congress. The first briefing was in the summer of 1958 and the second took place on 28 June 1962. Preparedness Sub-Committee, the House Armed Services Sub-Committee, the House Science and Astronautics Sub-Committee, CIA, and representatives from the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force.
3. A later effort of Major Keyhoe's to investigate a hearing on the House Space and Astronautics Committee during the summer of 1961 was unsuccessful. Congressman Joseph Karth of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, consistent background information regarding USAF force resources and the program, determined that the Air Force's approach to the program was appropriate and that Major Keyhoe's charges of mishandling were without grounds. A copy of Congressman Karth's letter to Major Keyhoe is attached.
4. Since it is apparent from Mr. Spoeight's letter that Major Keyhoe and others are attempting to force further Congressional hearings on the UFO program, Mr. Wilson's lengthy letter to Mr. Wilson is justified.
