Dear Sirs,

On the fifth of May, a mysterious hunched disc-shaped object was observed through binoculars for about 15 minutes. It was very high and made no sound. It appeared to be star-shaped when suddenly this object disappeared.

It was observed by Mrs. [redacted] and her daughter [redacted] approximately in the northwest area around 9:50 P.M.

It hovered or stood still and then moved laterally. It continued this motion for about 45 minutes, then moved out of sight to the north.

Enclosed is a statement regarding this matter.

Sincerely yours,

P.S. It was sighted 9/14/64 at 9:50 P.M.
