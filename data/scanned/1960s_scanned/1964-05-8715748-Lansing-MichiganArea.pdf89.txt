Toward duskier highway, or 623 feet away, plus the 30 feet the car moved before stopping.
Investigators found no traces of anything unusual on the road over a distance of about 0.2 mile. Where were some light impressions from tires, and some ruts were a car's tires had been and kicked up some local dirt that (the road material) was disturbed, but not beyond what their own car had done down the road.
The other investigators, Lt. Loomis, is not exactly the matter further, since just exactly the things observed which both sides or the road, or the metal, field. Standing water was noticed, near the spot where the object was supposed to have been, on the east side of the road. It was thought that some fog might have been caused to local conditions from this location.
The size of the object, drawn hereof the field trip to the location, corresponded very closely to the opening that can be seen between and under the bushes and fence like structure marking off the road. Anything that had landed on the road, such as a drifting cloud of fog, would, of course, take on the shape of the opening, flat on the bottom and a slightly flattened dome on top. It would seem, however, to correspond with headlight reflections on any fog that might appear, or at least determine if fog does arise shortly after dark.
The pilots basically saw a patch of fog drifting across the road; if that is the case, no other interpretation other than the description could be offered.
The pilots gave every indication of believing what they had observed, and it appears verified that they had stopped in a timely fashion.
