STATION ESTIMATE:

At 10:15 P.M., the object was observed to be stationary. It appeared to be cigar-shaped, about as large as a C-47 aircraft, and was very slow in moving. It appeared to be illuminated on the inside, and was as bright as magnesium flare. The object was sighted for about 10 to 15 seconds.
