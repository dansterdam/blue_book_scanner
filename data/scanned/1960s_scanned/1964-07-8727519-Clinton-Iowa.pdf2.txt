ILLINOIS HEADQUARTERS
SELECTIVE SERVICE SYSTEM
309 EAST WASHINGTON STREET
SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS 62701
22 July 1964

Major R. P. Casalaspro
Commander
277th Selective Service Squadron
Selfridge Air Force Base, D. C.

Dear Major Casalaspro:

If you think it appropriate I wonder if you would be kind enough to forward the attached report of a "flying saucer" to the Air Force office which is concerned with such phenomena.

Mr.        who submits this report, is a 63 3 clerk employed at this Headquarters for the past two years. He is honorably discharged from the Army after more than three years service in World War II. He is 52 years of age.

Mr.        is generally regarded at this Headquarters as a completely honest and reliable person. For this reason we consider it advisable to bring his report available to the Air Force.

This office as well as Mr.        would be most interested in knowing whether it develops that there is some explanation for the phenomenon.

Sincerely yours,

FOR THE STATE DIRECTOR

F. B. WOODWORTH
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Deputy State Director
