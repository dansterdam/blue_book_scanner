MAR 19 2268

Dear Sir,

This will reply to your letter of March 14, 1968, in which you described an unidentified flying object (UFO) that you observed.

Without additional supporting information, we cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will complete the attached 'Report of Unidentified Flying Objects', our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate the matter further.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base. Each base has a UFO investigator who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may be of interest and which you may find useful in reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
