The image appears to be a black and white photograph of an area of the ground. It shows a rocky, debris-strewn surface with what appears to be a shadowy, indistinct object in the center of the frame. The background is filled with branches and twigs, creating a cluttered and chaotic visual environment.

CASE NO. 66-78879
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT
Date: 6 September 1966
Location: Gwinner, North Dakota
Witness: Mr. John Jones

On 6 September 1966, at approximately 1920 hours, Mr. John Jones was driving on Highway 27 near Gwinner, North Dakota, when he observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to be descending rapidly and Mr. Jones pulled his vehicle to the side of the road to observe the object more closely.

Mr. Jones stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a brilliant white light. As the object descended, it slowed and appeared to hover approximately 30 feet above the ground. Mr. Jones then observed what he described as a "beam of light" emanating from the underside of the object, which illuminated the ground below.

After hovering for several minutes, the object then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. Mr. Jones immediately stopped his vehicle and went to the area where the object had hovered. He discovered several impressions in the ground, as well as some scorched vegetation.

The case was investigated by Project Blue Book and the Air Force determined that the sighting was of an unidentified flying object. No further information is available regarding the nature or origin of the object observed by Mr. Jones.
