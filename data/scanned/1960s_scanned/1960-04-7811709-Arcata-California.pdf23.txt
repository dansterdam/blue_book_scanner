TO: ATIC-482

Following is an extract from ATIC Daily Offices Report, Case No. FTD-479.

FACTS: A witness, an Airman First Class, Patrolman, Anniston Army Depot, Anniston, Alabama, reported to the military authorities that on 07 April 60 at approximately 0240 hours, while on routine patrol duty, he observed a "bright light" hovering over the installation. The light was circular in shape and gave off a pulsating brilliance. The witness watched the object for approximately five minutes, after which it accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared.

TECHNICAL ESTIMATE: The witness described the object as being circular in shape, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and hovering at an estimated height of 100 to 150 feet above the ground. The object was said to give off a brilliant, pulsating white light. No sound was reported. The witness stated that the object accelerated to a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight within approximately five minutes. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The witness requested to speak to a representative of the Air Force but was unable to do so. He further stated that he was not permitted to discuss the matter with anyone, including other members of the military police force. The witness reported that he recorded all observations on his duty log, which is reportedly being retained at the military police headquarters, Anniston Army Depot, Anniston, Alabama.

"Incident indicated the matter as "interesting" but with no apparent evidence that this was anything other than a natural phenomenon, such as a meteor or an aircraft. No further investigation appears warranted at this time."
