The image appears to contain a photographic report from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969. The report states that unidentified objects were found in a photo of the moon. The report describes the "areal anomalies appearing on the imagery" as most probably a combination of debris and reflections within the optical system, but notes that the resolution level of the specific identification of the areas indicated by the source to be UFOs.
