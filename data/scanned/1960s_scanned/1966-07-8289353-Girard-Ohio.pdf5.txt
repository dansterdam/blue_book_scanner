The OCR text from the document is as follows:

"34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 16 Aug 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questioned about your encounter:

There were a number of noticeable wind shifts and to the extent that the D. 0. F. (Direction of Flight) had to be corrected frequently. For example, 5 seconds one direction, 1-1 1/2 seconds the other direction, and as abrupt as the wind shift from East to west that would necessitate at times the complete correcting of the exhaust trail between readings. Occasionally the trail would become completely unsure which direction it was moving - it would literally just drift away, then reappear a split second later in a different direction. The movements appeared erratic, or a series of abrupt movements rather than a smooth continuous motion, as one would expect of a conventional aircraft. The object appeared a silvery white, metallic in structure, rather than a normal aircraft exhaust trail. It was unlike any conventional aircraft exhaust that I have observed. The total observed duration was approximately 20-30 seconds, with frequent abrupt changes in direction and attitude. When the observation terminated the object was still under power and still at an estimated altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet. There was no sound associated with this object. This rather confounding 'smoke trail' continued to puzzle me as to the nature of the power source and control system."
