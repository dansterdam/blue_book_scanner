The image contains a scanned document with text describing a report about a triangular-shaped object observed over Lyons, France on April 17. The report mentions that the object was observed by multiple witnesses, including at the Lyons-Bron Airfield, and that it exhibited various characteristics such as a changing azimuth angle, illumination, and slow traversal across the sky. The document also mentions that the British authorities were unable to "explain" the Hertfordshire object, and suggests that the French authorities may be more prepared to address this type of phenomenon.

FRANCE
Triangular shaped object over
Lyons
The Le Figaro on April 17 reported
that a mysterious luminous object was
observed in the sky over Lyons, France
on the evening of April 16. 
observers
in the sky would not have attracted
attention, and the object, which was of
a triangular shape, appeared to be moving.
At the Lyons-Bron Airfield it was also
seen by observers. Police received
calls from citizens who are unable to explain its presence
in the sky.
The object was observed with an
azimuth of 309 degrees and it even
showed a inclination of 32 degrees.
It presented an inclination of 32 degrees,
but this inclination slowly decreased
and after some minutes it was only 43
degrees. Observed with a powerful
telescope, the object appeared of
triangular shapes, powerfully illuminated by the sun which had already
gone down. It resembled a large empty
carton, or a big star, but the fact of
the matter is that something which was
slowly traversing the sky.
Experts say that interested to compare this sighting with a similar one
observed over England in 1962. The
full report of this incident witnessed
by numerous people to the National
Saucer Review, November-December, 
1963, issue. The photo, reproduced in this issue, taken 
by Mr Jan Willemyns who lives at
Rimby, Mern, may indicate that
the British authorities are unable to
"explain" the Hertfordshire object
as a weather balloon but for several
reasons this was nonsensical. It would
seem that the French authorities are
more prepared to let the facts speak
for themselves.
