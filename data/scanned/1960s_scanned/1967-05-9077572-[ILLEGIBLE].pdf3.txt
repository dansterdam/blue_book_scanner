The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a page from a document with technical illustrations and instructions. The page shows a diagram of a compass and an instruction to draw a picture that will show the motion of the object or objects observed. There is also a question asking if there was more than one object, and if so, to draw a picture showing how they were arranged and the direction they were traveling.

Here is the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point on the curved line to show how high the object (which you first saw) was when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where the object disappeared. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place a "B" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
