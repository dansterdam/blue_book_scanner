The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads:

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HELP DESCRIBE ITS APPEARANCE. WRITE A DESCRIPTION OF THIS SKETCH OR DRAWING.

What was the angular size? Hold a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a street lamp or a tree, and determine the match's apparent size compared to the known object. How large of an angular fraction of the phenomenon would have been covered by the match head.

The remainder of the document contains handwritten notes describing the observed phenomenon, but no further details or a sketch are provided.
