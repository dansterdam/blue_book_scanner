The image contains a diagram with a horizon line and a compass-like symbol in the top right corner. There does not appear to be a photograph in this particular page of the document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "Y" on the same sketch to show how big the object appeared to you when you first saw it.

28. On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being a weak motion and 10 being a strong motion), place a number to show the motion that the object or objects made. Place a "Z" on the sketch to show any changes in direction during the sighting.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
