The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or memo detailing a report from Major Metsoko regarding UFO sightings from various stations in South America on July 3, 1965. The text describes the sightings, including that the Chilean Commander reported the object as solid with magnetic distortions, traveling fast and hovering. The document also states that photos were taken but will not be available until March 1966, and that the Chilean Commander said it was a classic UFO sighting.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Memo For the Record: On 3 Jul 65 at 0940 hours, Major Metsoko from 1127th Field Activities Group called regarding UFO reports from Santo Domingo, Chile, British and Argentina Stations on a Rosefer Dispatch. (British UPI), R163 and R169, dispatched from Santo Diego 7 Jul at 753 pm. Three stations in Antarctic, Chilean, British and Argentina stations all reporting sighting an object over the horizon. Stations are all fairly far apart from each other. Objs observed on 3 Jul 65.
The Chilean Commander is an Air Force pilot who said the object appeared to be solid, had magnetic distractions, traveled fast, hovered. Speed was such that it was not an aircraft or anything made on earth. Major Metsoko said this was the classic UFO. British and Argentina stations observed it for ten minutes, zig zag overhead, stopped, hovered. They took photos. HOWEVER, THE PHOTOS WILL BE KAVAILABLE, BUT THEN CAN NOT GET THEM OUT UNTIL MARCH 1966. As far as Major Metseko knows the only kind of transmission service is by RADIO TRANSMISSION. They took ten colored photos.
A Santo Diego radio stationhad a radio interview with the Chilean Commander. British said it was not a star.
