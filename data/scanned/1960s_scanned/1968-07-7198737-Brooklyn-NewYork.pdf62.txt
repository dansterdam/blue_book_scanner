The image does not contain any photographs or images, it is a scanned document of handwritten text from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

OLD THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE AT ANY TIME
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME  
CHANGE DIRECTION OF FLIGHT SUDDENLY
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE
CHANGE COLOR
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS
CHANGE SHAPE
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR
LEAVE A TRAIL
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE
HAVE SEEM YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
IT WILL BE VERY CAREFUL TO SAY THAT IF IT IS
FOR LESS THAN A MINUTE,
PLANES TO LAND OR GROUND A UNIT, OR
LAND OR TAKE OFF FROM A FIELD WITHIN SIGHT.
A BOX IS IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
MOVED VERY FAST, SEEMED TO DROP OUT OF SIGHT.
DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
SEEMED TO MOVE TO FRONT OF SOMETHING CAN'T SAY WHAT.
