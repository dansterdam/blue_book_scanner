The text from the document is as follows:

"Kent, Ohio - 25 April, 1964 - 8:30 p.m.
Three objects were seen in a field about 800 yards from witness' home at Glenda Glen. The objects appeared to be parked. The first two objects were lens-shaped, one yellow-white and the other orange. They were seen side by side through the willow trees. They stood out prominently among the trees. The highest object was oval-shaped, yellow-white. The second object over rose straight up over the willow trees and hovered briefly 5 to 7 feet above its base. It was about 15 feet in diameter and its shape was that of a dome or an ellipse. It too, went out of sight in the distance. The third object started at a slight angle to the right, passed over about 200 yards, then red three times and vanished. They weren't positive, but they thought the object had stopped during the blinking. The second object was compared to a light aircraft (150 MPH). The first and third objects were estimated to be 1,500 feet away when first seen. All objects were soundless. No trail or other lights. Duration - 30 minutes. Sighted compared to a light aircraft (150 MPH)."
