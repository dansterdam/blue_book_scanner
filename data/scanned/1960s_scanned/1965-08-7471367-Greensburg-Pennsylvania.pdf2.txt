This is to report a call I made to Mr. ------ of Pennsylvania, relative to his sightings of August 12th and August 23rd of his wife of August 12th and August 23rd.

Mr. ------ runs his own business called ------ Irc. which is not only a business of maintenance and programming data of building industries, but also computer services to corporations, title agencies, etc. Until he began his own company he was a nuclear physicist in Pittsburgh, working on nuclear rocket propulsion.

I had long talks with him. He is not only scientifically oriented, but he is also a member of the Pittsburgh Astronomical Group. He apparently gets into some hot arguments with the leaders of this group, however, as he seems to contradict their stand on certain things concerning astronomy and linking up with a number of other than up with activities.

His sightings, as far as motion was concerned, was good except for three cases the motion was from east to west. There seems to be no doubt this event did take place as he said they did, and when coming to his particular sightings, in all three cases a bright light, apparently very much brighter than Venus, when and then fading out as they approached the horizon. Until satellites, as far as ascertain was concerned, was good except for three cases the motion was from east to west. There seems to be no doubt this event did take place as he said they did, and when coming to his particular sightings, in all three cases a bright light, apparently very much brighter than Venus, when and then fading out as they approached the horizon.
