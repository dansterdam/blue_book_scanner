There is no photograph present in this page from the UFO report document. The image shows a form with various questions and answers related to the sighting of an unidentified object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes, but because of brightness of flames.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what: It moved behind a cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what: It moved in front of a cloud.  

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - silent 
b. Color - whitish, black, metallic, round

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 50 %

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
