Dear Major Airman:

December 14, 1968 I sent you some photographs of something which I do not know. I received back a request of information that you wanted in regard to this photograph. This I sent immediately to your headquarters and I am still waiting for a reply. I said in this letter that I would like my negative back as soon as possible and I would appreciate this request most urgently as I need it. It has been almost 3 months since I have sent it and I have been wondering if something has happened to it. Please send it as soon as possible along with your reports if any. Thank you for your time and trouble.

Yours sincerely,
