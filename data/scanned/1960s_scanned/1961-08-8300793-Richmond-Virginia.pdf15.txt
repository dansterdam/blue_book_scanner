1952 APRIL 25,69 G.M.T.
A.M.S. No. 2395
In our files are found 13 reports of an extremely brilliant fireball which appeared on the above date at 11:52 p.m. E.S.T. Out of the 13 reports to come from Washington, D.C. and its vicinity, none were close together, but were scattered over an area about 50 miles in diameter, centering about 30 miles southwest of Washington. Five of the 13 reports were from Washington, D.C. proper. The fireball was observed as brilliant light, green and its size excessive, estimates of the latter running from one-half to three times the size of the full moon. The fireball's apparent size was from one-fourth to one-fifth the angular diameter of the full moon. Its duration was about 5 seconds, and the beginning altitude at about 40 degrees or more, and the end at north about 10 degrees or less, moving rapidly but on a shallow slant. This is the light description from the reports which are very detailed - - - - - -
