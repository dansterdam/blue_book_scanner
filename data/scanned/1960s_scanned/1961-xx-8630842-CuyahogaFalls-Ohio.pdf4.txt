Dear Sirs:

We are probably aware that, during late 1957 and early 1958, Brazilian Navy personnel observed a number of unidentified flying objects over the island or Trinidad in the South Atlantic. The U.S. officials sent photographs to Brazilian officials for comparison with those which Brazil had taken of similar objects, but some were confirmed or denied.

Since the U.S. Air Force, by virtue of AFR 200-2, has control of UFO sighting reports, I would like to know the results of his and any other investigation.

You immediate attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Civilian UFO Research
