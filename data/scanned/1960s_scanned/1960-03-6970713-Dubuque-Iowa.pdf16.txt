Analysis and Conclusions: The strip of film was given a thorough examination, and nothing of an unusual nature, nor anything such as described by the witness, could be seen in any of the frames. A check was made to determine the possibility of the objects being known stars and there was none in the area at this time. The elliptical location was normal for a sighting of this type and a natural explanation is indicated. The temperature was a cold 14 degrees with a 14 knot wind.
