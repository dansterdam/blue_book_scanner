STATEMENTS:

#2 stated that she had faintly along with her mother in-law heard a strange noise somewhat like a shriek and she watched for a short while and saw the television set begin to react strangely with the picture becoming un-focused. She said the noise lasted about 5-15 minutes and the picture on the television set seemed effected for about the same length of time. She described the noise as strange and sounding round and round and making what strange noise.

No sightings of any objects could be verified but the strange noise was noted by these two persons. They seemed quite upset about the incident. It was noted that the sound disturbance they noted was about 0415 hrs.
