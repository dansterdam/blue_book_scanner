Proposed reply to letter from John Zoppi, 28 January 1967

Dear Mr. _____,

Reference your letter of 28 January 1967 regarding your photograph of an alleged unidentified flying object on the night of 17 January 1967. Without substantial data and additional information on the sighting, a meaningful analysis is not in order. In spite of the information which you submitted, it is impossible for you to have seen Jupiter, Mars, and Venus at the same time. As an amateur astronomer, I am sure you are well acquainted with the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac. According to the text, on 17 January 1967, Venus set at approximately 6:00 P.M. EST, Mars rose at approximately 11:50 P.M. EST, while Jupiter rose at 5:30 P.M. EST. Thus it would have been impossible for you to have seen the three planets at the same time, a mistake on your part, I am sure.

If you would complete the enclosed PFJD Form 164 on your sighting and in addition provide the following camera data, a detailed study will be made. The camera data necessary is as follows:

a. Type of camera
b. Type of film
c. Focal length of camera
d. Lens manufacturer
