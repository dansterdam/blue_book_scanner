The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch appears to show instructions or questions related to an object or objects observed in the sky. The text accompanying the sketch provides directions for the observer to imagine a scenario and draw a picture to show the motion or arrangement of the observed objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "P" at the point where you first saw the object. Draw an arrow to show how high the object was above the horizon (by line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
