Dear Sir:
I have listened to your request and have given it some thought.  I realize that this is a very unusual situation and I do not know how to handle it.  I was awakened the other night by a bright light which shone through my window.  At first I thought it might be the moon, but it was much brighter and seemed to be coming in through the window.  I got up to investigate and saw a strange object hovering in the air outside.  It seemed to be a large, metallic craft of some kind.  The light was quite blinding and I had to shield my eyes.  I watched it for a few minutes before it suddenly shot off at tremendous speed.  I am not sure what to make of this experience and I am a bit shaken by it.  I would be interested to know if you have had any similar reports in this area.  Please let me know if you have any advice on how I should handle this.  I do not wish to become the subject of ridicule, but I felt I should report what I saw.

Sincerely yours,
