[Handwritten text:] The object was a solid round white light, about 3 inches in diameter, emitting light or luminosity from its body. There was no flash-ing, it was steady in its flight, except for a slight oscillation to the left and right. It flew in a straight line across the sky in about 15 seconds and disappeared. There were no other lights or objects associated with it. The object was on the horizon in front of me and shot across the sky at an angle above the horizon of perhaps 10 degrees. The sighting was in daylight and the sun was visible, slightly to my left.
