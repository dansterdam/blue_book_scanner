CIRCULAR IN SHAPE
14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? YES GRADUALLY
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): YES IT MOVED BEHIND      Don't Know

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound NONE HEARD b. Color BLUEISH WHITE TO SIMULAR TO "AJAX" CLEANER
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY OBJECT APPEARED SIZE OF SOFTBALL
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
