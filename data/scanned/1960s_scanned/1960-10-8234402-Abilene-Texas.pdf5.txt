DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

31 October 1960

This will acknowledge your letter of 14 October 1960 concerning your sighting of an unidentified flying object.

Your letter was most interesting but contained insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, we are unable to still out the attached Air Force questionnaire, as I previously requested, compiled documentary reports based on the information for their analysis and evaluation.

Sincerely,
Lawrence J. Tacker
Lt Colonel, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information

Your questions are answered in my letter. Please refer to it.
