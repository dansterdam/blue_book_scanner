34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 24 10 67
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
(1) OBJECT FIRST APPEARED AS A BRILLIANT SEARCHLIGHT
(13.6) AS THE OBJECT WAS TRAVELING OVER US FROM THE EAST OF TOWN, TIMES, WHEN IT STOPPED DIRECTLY AT IT, SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 2-3 SECONDS OVER HEAD I STARTED TO GO OVER IN MY MIND WHAT I HAD OBSERVED AND I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOISELESS AND IT WAS VERY CURIOUS. 3 TO 5 MINUTES
TO SAY THAT IT APPEARED AND THEN SEEMED TO VANISH IN A SPLIT SECOND.
(2) THE SPEED OF THIS THING WAS UNBELIEVABLE. IT WENT FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON IN A FLASH, LIKE A SHOOTING STAR, AND AS IT PASSED, IT SEEMED TO BE HOLLOW INSIDE AND LIGHTED UP WITH A BRILLIANT LIGHT, BUT IT LEFT NO TRAIL LIKE A SHOOTING STAR. AS IT PASSED OVER, I GOT A REFLECTION AT THIS POINT, A PART FLASHLIGHT TYPE LIGHT, AS SOON AS IT PASSED DIRECTLY OVERHEAD, THIS LIGHT DISAPPEARED AND IT WAS GONE. 
I NOTICED A S-SHAPED CURVE OR WAVE IN THE OBJECT JUST BEFORE IT SHOT OUT OF SIGHT, AND IT SEEMED TO TRAVEL ABOUT 5 SECONDS
I HAVEN'T ANY IDEA WHAT IT WAS THAT FRIGHTENED ME SO, BUT I KNOW THAT WHAT I OBSERVED WAS NOT NATURAL AND COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED BY ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN OR HEARD OF BEFORE.
(3) WE WERE WATCHING FOR BEARS IN AN OPEN FIELD WHICH WE FREQUENTLY DO, WHEN THIS OBJECT SUDDENLY APPEARED THAT WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING WE HAVE EVER SEEN ON THE EDGE OF THE TREETOPS.
