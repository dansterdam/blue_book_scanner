Dear Sir:

I have written you two times previously for information on U.F.O.'s but unbelievably I've never received a reply.

The incident we saw was in a Lapp's yard on September 19, 1961 near Valparaiso, Indiana. We were looking up at the sky-line when we heard a sound like an airplane, but different. The object came across the sky and then stopped just above the horizon for several seconds, then shot straight up and was gone within a split second. It was stationary, blinking, and about 30-40 feet in diameter and up to 150 feet long and a kind of massed luminous white-yellow. 

We contacted the nearest air force base at Wabash, Indiana. They said they had picked it up on radar and sent an officer to the farm to interview us. From his observations, he stated that there was no logical explanation for what we saw and that we had seen exactly what I have described, which he said matched the radar track they had.

I am very interested and concerned about U.F.O.'s and would appreciate any information you can give me on this incident or any others that may be similar. Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

Cordially yours,
[Signature]
