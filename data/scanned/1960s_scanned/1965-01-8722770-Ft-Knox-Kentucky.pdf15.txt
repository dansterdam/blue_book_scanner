TRANSCRIPT:

At approximately 6:25 p.m. on 10 January 1965, myself and Wendell Wayman, a Deputy Sheriff of Hardin County, Kentucky, were called to investigate a report of a strange light or lights observed in the area of Fort Knox, Kentucky. 

Upon arriving at the scene, approximately 7 miles east of Vine Grove, Kentucky, we observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be hovering. The light was bright white in color and seemed to be approximately 50-100 feet off the ground. The light appeared to be approximately 50-75 yards in diameter. 

After observing the light for approximately 15 minutes, it suddenly began to move in a southerly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. The light was so bright that it illuminated the entire area for several seconds. The light then seemed to fade or extinguish as it moved out of sight to the south.

While observing the light, we received several reports from local residents who had also observed the strange light phenomena. All reports were generally consistent in their description of the object.

This report is submitted for your information and consideration.

Respectfully,
Patrick J. Sheeny, Sergeant
Hardin County Sheriff's Dept.
Dec. 29 65
