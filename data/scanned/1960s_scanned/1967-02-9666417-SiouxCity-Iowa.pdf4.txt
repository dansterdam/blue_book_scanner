Text from the document:

"Project Blue Book is the official United States Air Force investigation of UFOs. The purpose of the investigation is to obtain any scientific or technical information that may lead to the identification and investigation of unidentified flying objects. The program is conducted in three phases. The first phase includes receiving and initial investigation of all reports. The second phase includes field investigations of all reports. The third phase includes laboratory analysis and evaluation of all information obtained.

"Air Force officers in Project Blue Book are responsible for all phases of the investigations. The Air Force officials interview the observers, collect physical evidence, photograph the suspected UFOs and pursue other investigations as necessary to identify the object. 

"If the initial investigation fails to identify the UFO, the report is forwarded to the Project Blue Book Detailed Analysis section for more intensive analysis and evaluation. This section has scientists and technicians who apply scientific methods and analysis to the specific reports. This analysis includes a detailed study of physical evidence, scientific analysis of photographs, and evaluation of witness testimony and other information.

"If the final analysis by Project Blue Book fails to identify the UFO satisfactorily, the case is filed as 'unidentified.' A small percentage of all reports received are filed in this category. For unidentified UFOs, the existing evidence is insufficient to provide a positive scientific identification of the object."
