1. The attached photograph is forwarded IAW AFR 80-17. Request your analysis -
be most expeditious because of the extremely high news interest.

2. Background: A staff photographer for the Miami Herald photographed
the him for the Miami News. He claims the photograph to the 10 Sep 68. The two
news articles interested in determining what the Air Force
thinks about this photograph and will probably run an
article with his picture in tomorrow's paper. The reverse
side of the photograph contains a caption stating that the Air Force
gives a report - it is because of this news interest
and almost immediately forwarding this photograph as soon as possible, and requesting that you
expedite the analysis. The negative can probably
be obtained if it necessary for the analysis. This
report is not urgent, however, in the normal manner because
of the camera equipment not watching the thunderstorm. He
was not watching the storm itself and did not discover
anything until he developed the film today.

3. Background on the photograph: The camera was a Nikon F
with a 105mm lens and was shooting at 1/500th at f 8.
It was open for approximately 1-2 minutes. The camera
was pointing almost due South according to
the compass, which took an angle of approximately 40 degrees
from the horizon. Mr etc. took 22 time exposures, all
with the same settings. The last two had something
showing between 5:00 and 5:30 PM EDT (1700-1730z). His location was 12553 SW 27th St., in
Miami (roughly 25 degrees-44 minutes north, 80 degrees-
17 minutes west).
