UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT - NOVEMBER, 1964

This object appeared to be drifting or gliding, as the plane's engines were turning but no propellers were visible. The speed was nearly as fast as the jet plane traveling with it. The object was sighted for possibly 30 to 60 seconds and was noted as being quite bright.

The St. Petersburg Times newspaper of November 20 carried an item stating that the police had received a report from a resident of Pinellas County, Florida, who claimed to have seen a bright object in the sky the previous evening. This person was interviewed and provided information that matched the details in the official report.

The witness was not able to identify the object, but it was described as bright and glowing. No time was given for the sighting of the other echo satellites on the scope at that time, and it was not determined if this object could have been one of the other satellites. 

The air traffic controller had contacted Mr. Cambridge to request identification, but he was not able to identify the object. The witness was persuaded to do so and upon his request, the controller gave a description of the object, but it did not match anything known. The witness stated the object was not an airplane and he was not able to identify it.

The report indicates that the object appeared to be over 100 miles distant and seemed to be just a bright light. It was tracked on the radar scope for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The witness stated he had been appearing simultaneously with some 40 to 50 other objects on the scope, but this one seemed to be brighter and more distinct than the others. No identification was made.
