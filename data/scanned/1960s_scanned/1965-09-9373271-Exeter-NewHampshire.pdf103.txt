Dear Sir, 
I should like to my report to you concerning a series of remarkable sightings which occurred in the area of Exeter, New Hampshire on the night of September 3, 1965.

I was startled in this matter and I am indebted in this matter. I should like to know if these objects, Russian, United States or otherwise, are the things and what is their purpose. If this should know it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time. I would appreciate an answer at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
