There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report detailing an incident where multiple artillery flares were observed in the sky near Fort Carson, Colorado on August 13, 1965. The document provides details about the observation and the response from Air Force personnel, including the analysis that the sighting was likely an "optical illusion" rather than a physical object.
