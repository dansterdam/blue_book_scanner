There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a typed letter from the Project Blue Book Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base regarding some photographs that were sent in for analysis.

August 26, 1964

Dear Mr. *****,

Enclosed are the photographs which you brought over us and asked to have analyzed.

Our Project Blue Book Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has analyzed the set of photographs and finds them to be approximately 14 inches in diameter and 7 inches tall. The photographs are stated to be 20 inches in diameter and 14 inches tall. Photograph #2 shows the UFO at a close range with passing lights visible on the right side of the object and in a second set of flashing lights which are further away. Therefore the object is between the two sets of flashing lights which is further away. The project office considers the photographs to be a genuine UFO sighting.

If humanoids were inside of this alleged flying saucer, they would have to be 7 inches tall. The Project Office considers the photographs to be a genuine UFO sighting.

The photograph alleged fighting which lead to the photograph of the other object has never been officially received.

Sincerely,
