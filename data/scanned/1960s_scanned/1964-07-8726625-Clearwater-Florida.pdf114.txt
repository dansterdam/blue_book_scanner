The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Our son, the 4th party, watched them with his telescope. He saw they were about 35 to 40 feet long, shaped like saucers, and were hovering about 500 feet in the air, 1/4 mile distant. The two objects remained stationary for about 30 seconds, then accelerated and shot off at a terrific speed. The noise was the same as viewed by the other witnesses at ground level. All seemed to be the same as viewed by the others. The following case represents the results of visual illusions.
