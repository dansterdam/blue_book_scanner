"UFOs Sighted In Haverhill, Mass.
Unidentified flying objects, which the police chief claims were seen by a number of townspeople, appeared over Haverhill Sunday night, according to a published report. 
Several persons, including the police chief, said they saw the objects hovering over the city for about two hours Sunday evening. The objects apparently paid a call on Bradford and other nearby areas as well. 
Later, they manifested themselves over the Haverhill police station, the chief said. 
The objects, however, had said nothing unusual from that direction. A large group of people in the vicinity stood watching the mysterious lights in the night sky, but they could not identify them, the chief reported.
One woman, Mrs. Conway, told the Gazette she and her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Russell Conway, had watched the sighting from the Conway home. 
'Mother,' Mrs. Conway told her daughter, 'come and see those lights in the sky.' 
The chief traveled in a police cruiser investigating the sighting. He said the objects were hovering about 1,000 feet in the air, and they appeared to be about 15 to 20 feet in diameter. The objects moved up, down and sideways with 'incredible speed,' the chief said. They came in four distinct colors, including red, blue, green and white, he added.
Pollard, a school teacher, said the air was 'quite clear' that night when the objects were first sighted. He had never thought seriously about flying saucers until he saw them, but we did not say he was convinced they were something out of this world.
Meanwhile, residents of neighboring communities, including Methuen and Church, said they, too, had spotted a flying light, described as 'pulsating red and white, with the colors changing around the middle.'
Several persons, in addition to the police chief, were interviewed, including Fire Chief Mathews, who had been called to the scene from the police station."
