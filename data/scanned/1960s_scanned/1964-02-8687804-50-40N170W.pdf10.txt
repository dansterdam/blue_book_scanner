Object Sinks Yacht

The yacht, "Kattie D" - a converted Navy search and rescue craft - was struck by an unknown object about 25 miles off the rugged coast of Cape Mendocino, California, on Wednesday, 5 February, 1964. The yacht sank after a collision, killing 4 crewmen, the Captain and a German shepherd puppy. We are including this incident because it correlates with the official and unofficial sightings of UFO in the ocean in recent years.
