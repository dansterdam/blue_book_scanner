1. The following confirms information telephonically furnished to the Regional Supervisor Field Investigations Section on 30 August 1960, subject incident:
On 30 August 1960, Special Agent RICHARD A. HOLMES, Detached Duty, District No. 1, PIC HANSCOM FIELD, was contacted telephonically by a civilian source, name not 1930 hours. He stated that on 26 August 1960, at approximately 1930 hours, he, his wife, and three children sighted an unidentified flying object over Andover, Mass.
He stated as they were facing southeast, they observed the object hovering at an altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. The object appeared to have a yellowish-white light and was approximately the size of a "pursuit type" aircraft. The object hovered for approximately three minutes, at which time it descended at a very rapid rate of speed. The object then disappeared from view.
He estimated the speed of the unidentified flying object to be approximately 300 miles per hour. The sky was clear and bright although the object did not have any markings which would identify it as a known aircraft.
