Aug st 29, 1967
I saw a flying over my house, 
about 6:30 in the morning. It was a round object, 
about the size of a small airplane, 
and was hovering and almost stat onary.
I has about two feet from myself.
It object disappeared right by me 
and immediately shot away. 
I am a very good observer of objects in 
the sky, and this was not a known aircraft. 
It was much for a small plane or helicopter.
I saw about the length of time and only 
saw it a couple nights for all UFOS
organizations.
I hope this may help me, this is absolutely 
true, and I am not a student person by 
my mean.
