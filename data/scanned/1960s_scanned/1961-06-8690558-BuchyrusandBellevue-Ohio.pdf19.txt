TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

DEAR MR. ******,

YOUR THOMAS LOPEZ addressed to the Technical Intelligence Center of this office. 

Regarding the description of the sightings seen by your friend, and the details as given are probably the most comprehensive I have seen in connection with this type of report. The location, time, duration, direction of movement, description of the object, and the color and apparent size in relation to known objects are all very helpful in analyzing the report.

I hope that this information is helpful.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM A. COLEMAN, JR.
