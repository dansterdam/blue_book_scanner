Dear Mr. Mellinger,

I wish to express my sincere appreciation for your excellent report of 17 January 1963 which you submitted to the Aerial Phenomena Office. Your comprehensive report has enabled my UFO Office to properly evaluate the alleged Tucson UFO incident as a hoax.

Once again, thank you for the assistance you have given to the Foreign Technology Division. 

Sincerely,

RAYMOND B. SLEEPER, Colonel, USAF
Commander
