Salesman Chats
With Space Visitor
PARKERSBURG, W. VA. (UP) - With police and Air Force representative listening, Woodrow Derenberger, a tire salesman, told of his alleged meeting with a "man from outer space" who he said he talks to several times a week.
However, the "spaceman" did not show up, according to Derenberger, because, he said, the salesman had not complied with the "spaceman's" request to "take me home."
Derenberger, the salesman and father of two, told a strange story of his encounter with the "spaceman" while he was driving home from Marietta, O., on Interstate 77, Tuesday evening.
Derenberger said the "spaceman" communicated with him telepathically and was about six feet tall, with black hair and a ruddy complexion. He described the "spaceman" as about 40 years old "by our standards" and said the "spaceman" told him he was from a different "world."
DERENBERGER SAID the side of the UFO then opened up and a "door" appeared. The "spaceman" then invited Derenberger to enter for a 10-minute conversation, he said, the salesman continued through and his lips were closed in a tight line as if he did not want to discuss what was said.
