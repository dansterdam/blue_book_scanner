Akron Ohio
21 January 1961

On 21 Jan 61, several witnesses in the Akron, Ohio area reported seeing an unidentified flying object. The information from the witnesses was generally consistent. She objects were first observed at 2250 and 2300; appearing at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. The objects were further described by the witnesses as appearing as a circle or disc with the ratio of diameter to height as approximately 10 to 1.

On 21 Jan 61, the official monument at Akron was 2304. This time, of course, will be the approximate time of the sighting, as the position of the observer. However these deviations will be small. The moon was approaching first quarter and was illuminated.

When the moon is just rising or setting, it often assumes an elliptical shape with the longer diameter parallel to the horizon. This is caused by atmospheric refraction, modifying the true shape. There is for apparently no luminosity associated with the bodies; there were no layers of discontinuity in the atmosphere, the distortion will be even more marked. The distortion involved is not the direct result of the moon but is caused by the refraction. This is probably the reason the witnesses did not recognize the object it was identified as a flat or "saucer-like" craft.

On 21 Jan 61 at 2258 the weather at Akron-Canton Airport was a 2,000 foot overcast, scattered 7/8, visibility was 7 miles, and the temperature was 38Â° F.

It is the Air Force conclusion that the witness object viewed by the witnesses in Akron, Ohio on 21 Jan 61 was the setting moon distorted by atmospheric refraction. This conclusion is substantiated by the facts that the moon was nearing first quarter and the approximate time of moonset with none occurring after 2305 which is only one minute after the official moonset time for Akron, Ohio on 21 January 1961.
