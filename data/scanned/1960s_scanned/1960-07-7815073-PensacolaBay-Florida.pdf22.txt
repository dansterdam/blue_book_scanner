Only now, almost 6 months later, has a detailed fighting seen last July 1st become a matter 
of public record. It happened at Montpelier, Idaho, on July 1, 1960, and appears to be one of the most 
highly polished metal having the shape of two dinner-plate size faces to face. One
of the witnesses claimed that it had a diameter of 135 feet, and was 14 feet thick 
through the center. They transparency bubble projected from the bottom. 
The object was viewed by a family of 5 and took some 15 minutes to disappear. It 
shot on toward the ESE at tremendous speed. There was no evidence of jets, rocket exhaust, 
propeller, flame, or smoke, and no sound was heard.
