Based on the instructions provided, there does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image seems to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

29 March 1966, received telephone call from Jack Grohne 
620 Londerry, Findley, Ohio and spoke with Airman Elmer. 
Mr Grohne took photos of an object he observed this morning 
at 4:50 am. Observed object in the eastern portion of 
town, about 1 mile from him. He waited till it got in 
distance where he could get a phone. It came out completely 
black (film) no light whatsoever. Object was hovering and 
went back and forth and oscillating until 6:20 am it was 
100 feet off the ground. Object seemed to go straight up. 
Asked if we could have the film and analyze it. Informed 
him that we would return it upon completion of analysis 
and we would also send him a form to fill out.
