CASE NO. 30
LOCATION: NORTHOLMSTED, OHIO
DATE: NOVEMBER 6, 1967
INVESTIGATOR: WILLIAM SPAULDING
SUMMARY OF INCIDENT: On the evening of November 6, 1967, at approximately 7:30 p.m., a resident of North Olmsted, Ohio, observed a strange light formation in the sky over his home. The witness, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that he was standing in his backyard when he noticed a cluster of lights in the sky, slightly to the east-southeast and at an estimated altitude of 5,000 feet. The lights, which he described as pale orange or yellowish in color, appeared to be moving in a northwesterly direction.
The witness observed the lights for approximately 10 minutes before they gradually disappeared from view. He reported the incident to the local police department, and an investigator from NICAP was subsequently dispatched to the scene to gather further information and evidence.
INVESTIGATOR'S FINDINGS: The investigator, William Spaulding, interviewed the witness and took several photographs of the area where the incident was reported to have occurred. The photographs, however, did not reveal any significant details or anomalies. The witness was unable to provide any additional physical evidence to support his account.
CONCLUSION: Based on the limited information and lack of physical evidence, the investigator was unable to determine the nature or origin of the light formation observed by the witness. The case has been classified as "unresolved" pending further investigation or the availability of additional information.
