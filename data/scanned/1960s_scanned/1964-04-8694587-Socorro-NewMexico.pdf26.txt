"Saucer" Reports

SOCORRO â€” Dr. J. Allen Hynek, special unidentified flying obje.?ct consultant to the Air Force, arrived here' Tuesday night to begin his investigation of the Socorro policeman's report that he saw a mysterious flying object land and take off again.

Dr. Hynek said he hoped to talk to the policeman, Lonnie Zamora, and to return to the site where Zamora said he saw the object land Tuesday morning.

Zamora, a policeman, reported that at 5:45 p.m. Tuesday he saw a flame on the ground and an object described at an egg-shape, about 12 to 15 feet long, on the desert floor. He said as he approached, the object rose rapidly and flew off.

Dr. Hynek said he would visit the Socorro Observatory and the adjoining Langmuir Laboratory, where a new telescope, the largest in the world, was being installed when the incident occurred at Espanola, where it was reportedly spotted, as a follow-up to the investigation.

Hynek said the findings of the probe would be turned over to the Air Force. Meanwhile, the investigation was being conducted by the office of the Aerial Phenomena Branch of the Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.

Sgt. David Moody of the base already was in Socorro, joining in the investigation with Dr. Hynek.

The report was another in a series which have kept New Mexico and military authorities busy since Zamora's original report Friday. The reports continue to come from points following a line from south of Espanola.

Implications have been hinted at involving the director of the "Aerial Phenomena" Branch of the Air Force, but officials said today they knew of no such implications.
