There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document containing text about a reported UFO sighting.

Output of the text from the document:

On July 25, the Daily Express reported the ball landing in a barley field near Meredith, New Hampshire. Police and a local pilot inspected the field but found no evidence of a landing. Meanwhile investigations continued and the reports were being evaluated. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, scientific consultant to the Air Force on Project Blue Book, was called in to investigate.

It was not very difficult to respond satisfactorily to the questions proposed by Dr. Hynek. The day after the alleged landing, Mr. Howard Meredith, the owner of the field, showed him the site. There were no marks on the ground and no evidence that anything had landed there. The possibility that a weather balloon had come down in the field was considered unlikely by Dr. Hynek, since there was no record of any balloons being launched in that area at that time.

The Command had therefore to reject the report as being without foundation. The British Museum representatives who had investigated the matter independently came to the same conclusion.
