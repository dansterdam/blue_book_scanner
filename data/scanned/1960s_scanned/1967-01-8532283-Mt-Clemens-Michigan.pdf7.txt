DETROIT - 57279 UFO - REPORT OF THE NATION'S LEADING EXPERTS ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. ON JANUARY 6 A, 1960, THE DETROIT SUN-HERALD MAD HIS CLAIM THAT PHOTOGRAPHS OF A FLYING SAUCER OVER MOUNT CLEMENS, MICHIGAN, WERE TAKEN. THEIR PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRIKING. THAT PHOTOGRAPH IS BEING CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK WHICH COLLECTS ALL REPORTS FOR THE MILITARY, CONSIDERED IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS ANYTHING OF VALUE THAT COULD BE INFERRED FROM THE ALLEGED SGHTED OBJECT. CLARIFIED FACTS TAKEN LAST WEEK NEAR THE DETROIT SUBURB OF MOUNT CLEMENS.
THIS IS SO FAR DESC BUT DOES NOT SHOW ANY INDICATION OF AN OBVIOUS HOAX.
ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, THE OBJECT WOULD BE DESCRIBED AS A ROUND PLATE SHAPED FIGURE, SILVER IN COLOR AND EXTREMELY BRILLIANT WHICH HAD VERTICAL PATTERNS ON ITS SURFACE AND ALSO 1b VISUAL DESCRIPTIONS I'VE TAKEN FROM EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNTS. 
NO REPORT HAS BEEN MADE OF THE SELECTION, WHICH MAS BE WITHHELD BY THE OWNER, UNTIL SCRUTINY IS COMPLETED WHICH SHOMLD BE IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS.
THE PICTURE BEING AS IT APPEARS TO BE, WAS TAKEN AROUND SAID P-M ON - JANUARY 6, - 1960. TWO COLOR PICTURES WERE ACTUALLY EXPOSED, WHICH WOULD SUPPORT A VISUAL DESCRIPTION OF THEIR SHAPE AND BRIGHTNESS.
ALL THE "EYEWITNESS" CLAIMS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE CAREFULLY EXAMINE ANY SIGHTED OBJECTS OR AIR FORCES WHICH THEY PERMITTED ON THE AREA THEY SAW THE. THEY WERE AFRAID THAT IT MIGHT BE SOME TOP SECRET MILITARY PROJECT, AND SO DID NOT TO LET THE AIR FORCE EXAMINE THE ORIGINAL PRINTS..
