Dear Lt., someone-- illegible, approximately 4-5 words--
and I am -----. that they are --
I hate to bother you with this letter, but I must tell you what happened to me last night, July 14, 1960.
I was driving to the U.S.C.A.R and on my way home about 10:30 PM ----- I saw a strange light in the sky. At first I thought it was an airplane, but it was much larger and brighter. It seemed to be hovering or moving slowly. As it came closer I could see it was not an airplane, but some kind of unidentified flying object.
It was round in shape and emitted a bright light. I watched it for several minutes as it moved across the sky. Then it suddenly took off at a terrific speed and disappeared. I have never seen anything like it before. I am quite sure it was not an airplane or any other known object. I would like to report this incident to you, as I feel it may be of interest to your organization.
Please let me know if you would like any further information. I will be glad to give you all the details.

Sincerely yours,
------ illegible name--
