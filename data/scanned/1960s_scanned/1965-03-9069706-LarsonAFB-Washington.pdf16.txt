Professor Reports E-M Phenomena

A University professor in Victoria, B.C. informs us that he was awakened Sunday, 7 March, by a strange noise. He turned on the lights and went outside to investigate. He saw an unidentified flying object hovering over his house for about 2 or 3 minutes. The object was silent, oval-shaped, and had reddish-orange lights on the side. It made no sound and eventually moved off to the northeast. 

The professor then drove down to Victoria from Swartz Bay as usual when, on the last 100 yards of his drive, his car engine and lights failed. The engine restarted normally as he approached his home in the country, all of his electrical systems having returned to normal operation.

The next day he took his car in for a check-up and the mechanic found nothing wrong. The professor later learned from his Civil Defense monitor who alerted him to the UFO sighting that a similar incident of engine and light failure had been reported in Victoria that night.

The document states that these phenomena might be considered unrelated incidents and possibly they are - but they have been observed in conjunction with UFO sightings previously, so the incidents are included in this report.
