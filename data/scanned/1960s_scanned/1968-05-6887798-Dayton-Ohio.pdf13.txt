AS YOU IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

1. IN THE SPACE BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW A LINE CONNECTING THE "X" AND THE "+" TO SHOW THE APPARENT COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. WHEN THE PHENOMENON APPEARS TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO THE SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
