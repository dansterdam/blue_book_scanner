The image contains a report form from Project Blue Book, which appears to be filled out by an observer who witnessed a UFO sighting. The form does not contain any photographs, only a hand-drawn sketch in the bottom right corner.

The text from the form is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? no

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound a strange, high-pitched whining noise
b. Color bright reddish

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

(A hand-drawn sketch of a saucer-shaped object is shown in the bottom right corner of the form, with an arrow pointing to the right.)
