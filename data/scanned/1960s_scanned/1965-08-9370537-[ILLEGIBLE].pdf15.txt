Narrative of Sighting of RAFL Air Station 
The witness, a retired officer, all phases of his career were managerial and administrative. He is considered a reliable and respectable observer. 
At about 2:30 A.M. on 7 August 1965 the witness was awakened by what he described as a "pulsating light" hovering over the field just outside the station perimeter. The light was approximately 800-1000 yards distant and about 200-300 feet off the ground. He observed it for about 5 minutes before it accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared. He said the light pulsated with a regular rhythm and changed size and intensity as it moved. 
The witness considers the incident unusual and perplexing. He said it was unlike anything he had ever observed before and he is at a loss to explain what it could have been. Although interested in the subject of UFOs, he has not reported any previous sightings. 
The report was submitted to M.C.A., UFO, Central Security Section for evaluation.
