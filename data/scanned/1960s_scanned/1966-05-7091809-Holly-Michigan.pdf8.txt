August through the viewer of a Polaroid camera. It could be the object moving or it could have been the object going into or out of the camera. The camera the object moved rapidly. It could have been an accident for the reel not being moved slightly is that I moved the camera slightly action I seen it move and it disappeared. It was about 20 feet away from me. It was about 6 to 8 inches in diameter. There should be no detective clues across as the camera exposed to light for test exposure intended to be made was made.
