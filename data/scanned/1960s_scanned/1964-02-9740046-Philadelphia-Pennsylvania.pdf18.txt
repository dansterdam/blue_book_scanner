Dear Mr. [redacted],

The Office of the President has asked the Air Force to reply to your letter.

There is no truth to allegations that the Air Force maintains unidentified personnel (flying saucers) who function as a reconnaissance or investigation group. 

All investigations of unidentified flying objects and similar phenomena are conducted by the scientific staff of Project Blue Book, the official Air Force program for the collection, evaluation, and analysis of information on unidentified flying objects. Individuals are assigned to support this program on a part-time basis as required and are not maintained as a special investigative force.

As of this date, no indications of a technological break-through to the extent claimed have been discovered by the Air Force scientific investigations. There has been no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force which would substantiate the existence of vehicles under intelligent control from outside the range of present scientific knowledge.

Your interest in Air Force activities is appreciated.

Sincerely,

C. R. CARLSON
Colonel, USAF
Deputy Chief
