JETS CHASE FLYING SAUCERS OVER WASHINGTON, D.C. - "An incredible UFO sighting was made in the nation's capital on the afternoon of January 23, 1965. Five US jet interceptors from Andrews AFB near Washington chased a formation of fast-moving unidentified objects over the city for nearly an hour. The pilots reported that the objects were metallic, round, and maneuvered with fantastic speed and evasive tactics that seemed to defy the laws of physics. Two or more of the objects appeared to be much closer than the others and seemed larger in size. The pilots stated that they were convinced the objects were under intelligent control. It was an incident that received national attention and whose significance has never been fully explained. There was no question in the minds of the pilots that they were dealing with visitors from another world, whose technologies were vastly superior to our own. They expressed frustration at their inability to shoot down these elusive craft, and amazement at the seemingly impossible things the objects could do. The news of this sighting eventually became public, but the Air Force's official explanation - that the pilots were actually chasing the planet Venus - was met with widespread skepticism and disbelief. Many feel that the truth about this and other dramatic UFO encounters is still being kept from the public.
