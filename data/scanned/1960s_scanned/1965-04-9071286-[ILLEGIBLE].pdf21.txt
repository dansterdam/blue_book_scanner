The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document says:

24. Date you completed this questionnaire: (16) Sunday, April - 1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a comprehensive explanation of your sighting:

The object I saw had no colored lights.
The object appeared to be roughly spherical, much greater in apparent size than a B-52 or other well known aircraft at the same distance. The motion of the object could not be described as normal powered flight or gliding. It had a sort of floating, drifting motion. The object seemed to be under intelligent control, as it would alter its course and/or speed quite abruptly. The report could not be compared to any known aircraft or other object. The object was much larger than any conventional aircraft, and showed no visible means of propulsion, wings, tail surfaces, etc.
