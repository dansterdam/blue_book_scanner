What he may have mistaken for mere observations might have been attempts to reach it. He claims to have had an experience while visiting a relative in the hospital, and that he almost lost his life in the process. Another thing that strikes me as peculiar in his resume is that someone only 25 years old claims to have 20-20 vision, but is this with or without glasses?

If there is anything to his story besides his own imagination, it is strongly suggest that someone other than Hytek ask the questions. He seems to be somewhat mentally disturbed, and I do not trust the judgement of the observer.

I can be along way off, and I suggest some new leads and new thought. I shall be satisfied.
