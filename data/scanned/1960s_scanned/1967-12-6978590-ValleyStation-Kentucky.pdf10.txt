E. SPECIFY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS OR
HIGH-INTENSITY LIGHTS. DESCRIBE THE ILLUMINATION, WHETHER IT WAS STEADY, FLASHING, ETC.

It (the object) appeared to be a point of light from a distant source. Die 2 diameter was estimated to be 4500 ft. and about 4 or 5 swept of a search light from a aircraft. The reflecting light had a white color cast to it but due to the darkness it possibly could have been any color.

The object was definitely self-luminous and gave off a white light.

The shape of the object is unknown, but is believed to be solid. One only comparable objects I know which would be close are either a large star or a white recognition light on an aircraft, but due to its very erratic flight pattern it could not have been one or the other.
