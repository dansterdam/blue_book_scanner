35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionaire or in previous explanation of your sighting:
I saw at this relative altitude a very bright silvery object at approximately 7:30 a.m. and again at 2:30 p.m. (night) since the sighting we have reportedly recalled the area - typical night. However, the object came straight down and may be any object I can not identify. Quite mysterious as to the creatures flight. But there is no thing abnorm ally in the area of the sighting - it is completly empty.
