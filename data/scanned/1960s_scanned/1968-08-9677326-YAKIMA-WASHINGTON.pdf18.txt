LEAVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY
BREAK INTO SMALL PIECES
CHANGE DIRECTION VERY FAST
MOVE BEHIND CLOUD THEN OUT AGAIN
FLASH VERY BRIGHT 
HAVE DE-APPEARED
SUDDENLY APPEAR AGAIN
SEEM LIKE A STAR
COULD JUST BE CLOUD 
WHAT WAS YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON

The object moved in a straight line at first, then suddenly sped up and ran away. It broke into small pieces, changed direction very fast, moved behind a cloud and then came out again, flashed very bright, disappeared, and then suddenly appeared again. It seemed like a star at times, but could have just been a cloud.
