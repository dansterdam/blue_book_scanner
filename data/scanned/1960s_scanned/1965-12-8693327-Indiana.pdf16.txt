Dear Dr. [redacted],

Please excuse our delay in answering your letter regarding your unidentified object observation. A heavy backlog of correspondence and reports has prevented our answering all inquiries as promptly as we should like.

The object which you observed, south of Pittsburgh, on the evening of December 9, 1965, was definitely a brilliant celestial body. This same object was reported to the Air Force by numerous observers in Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

Your interest in our program is appreciated. Thank you for reporting your sighting to us.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
