NCFO SUMMARY 1965
Dec. jan. 24, 6.9
Dear sir,
I am writing to report an incident that occurred in 1965 which I have some more details.
My family and I sighted a 24'30" oval-shaped while watching TV. It was hovering motionless for sometime. Suddenly it started to move at incredible speed and disappeared into the distance.
I called the military but they seemed disinterested. I thought it was worth reporting it again in case you have more information on similar occurrences. It was a white light a few miles away. It was a definite UFO, it started to move up and to the north at such a high speed that it immediately disappeared.
It could have been a secret military craft, but if that's the case, it was far more advanced than anything I've seen. The change of color from white to light green and then to white again was very surprising.
It was a light orange in color. It was made up of a half circle with what looked like a huge, retractable antenna on the back.
