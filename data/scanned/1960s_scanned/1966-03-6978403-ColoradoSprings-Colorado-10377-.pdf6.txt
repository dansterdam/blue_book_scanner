UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO
MARCH 6, 1966 - 10:37 P.M.

THE OBSERVER STATES HE WAS DRIVING FROM COLORADO SPRINGS TO COLORADO CITY WHEN HE OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT OVER THE MOUNTAINS NORTH OF COLORADO SPRINGS. AT FIRST HE THOUGHT IT WAS A SHOOTING STAR, BUT AS HE CONTINUED DRIVING, THE LIGHT CAME INTO VIEW AGAIN AND HE DESCRIBED IT AS BEING VERY BRIGHT AND DISTINCT. HE STOPPED HIS CAR TO OBSERVE IT FURTHER AND SAW THE LIGHT MOVING IN AN ERRATIC PATH, BOTH HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY. THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

BECAUSE NO OBVIOUS EXPLANATION IS APPARENT FOR THIS INCIDENT, IT IS CLASSIFIED AS UNIDENTIFIED.
