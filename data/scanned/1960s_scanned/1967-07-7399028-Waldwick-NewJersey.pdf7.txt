The image contains a photograph. The photograph appears to be an official U.S. Air Force form or report, which contains several diagrams and instructions related to reporting unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The form includes instructions for how to indicate the position and direction of an observed object on a compass-like diagram, as well as instructions for drawing a diagram to show the motion of the object or objects observed.

Text Transcription:
In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same compass when you last saw it.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and tell in which direction they were traveling.
