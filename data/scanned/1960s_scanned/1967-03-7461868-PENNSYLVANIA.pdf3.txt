"page 2

We saw a bright light for a while. It was so bright that it almost hurt the eyes to look at it. It was real bright like a flash from a camera and after it disappeared the eyes did not see it immediately again. The light was not steady but it flickered. After the light was out every thing seemed dark. We could see for a while but then everything became dark again.

At this time we continued investigating the entire ship and we were on one side of it and we saw the light again which was real bright and high. We were looking at it and it seemed to be directly behind the trees. That immediately attracted our attention and we started checking the direction of the light. We turned our flashlights in that direction. 

The light was under constant observation from the moment we first saw it. The light, as they came on, did not blink but remained steady.

The light was under constant observation from the moment we first saw it. The two lights did not blink but remained steady.

We several times watched the light and we could tell that it was some kind of object in the sky, one light mixed-up with anything else which could have been a part of the object.

I have made this as plain as I could and I hope I have enclosed information may not be as I want it to be.

I will gladly answer any questions you may have.

Summerhill, Pa."
