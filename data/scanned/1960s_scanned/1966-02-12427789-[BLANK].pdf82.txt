Man Recounts Run-In With 'Saucer Robot'
BROCKSVILLE, OH - It made a "whistling noise" and was about 5 1/2 feet in height or even taller, retired longshoreman John P. Reeves said yesterday in describing a bizarre incident he claims to have stumbled onto in the Brocksville area.
Reeves, who admits to being "past 69," told a story of a being or creature that appeared to take his picture. 
REEVES, WHO LIVES ALONE at a trailer park's mobile home unit, said the incident occurred at mid-afternoon on Wednesday as he was walking along Highway 20 about 700 yards from his residence.
"I saw the object when the robot-type creature appeared and walked toward me," Reeves said. "It was blush-green and reddish-purple in color with two pieces of cloth-like paper as it headed back to the saucer."
Reeves said the creature flashed a third time and then rushed back to the saucer, which had remained about 100 feet away. "THEY WERE FROM outer space," he said. The team said the creature's actions were more like those of a "moving machine, some blinking open and shut." 
Reeves said the team started circling and rushing, then started straight up. It was out of sight in 10 seconds.
The two pieces of paper were turned over to an investigator. The team said the Air Force would be notified of the incident for further investigation.
