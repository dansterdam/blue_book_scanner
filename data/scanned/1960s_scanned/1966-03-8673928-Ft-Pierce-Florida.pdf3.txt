Dear Sir's:
I am a-typing this letter to you because I am a believer in U.F.O.'s. So this is the story of when a friend of mine and I saw what we believe is not swamp gases, balloon's, or anything like that. My friend and I were going to scout's on March 29, 1966. We have to walk through the woods to get there.So we were going along when we saw a bright object. We thought it was a rocket, so we stopped to watch it. In our town, we can see rockets go off. A downrange rocket can be bright, so we didn't think it was a flying saucer. Then I stopped to think, rocket's aren't seen taking off from the south. I told my friend, he agreed, to though it it was a balloon, the kind painted with fluorescent paint. So we sat and wondered go, go, we went on, then it got brighther. We stopped again. Then it got so bright, we couldn't look at it. So then we got to wondering. No balloon does this! So it went out like when you turn out a light. So we went walking around where we thought it was hovering. Sure enough, it was on the ground. As soon as we got close enough to see what it was, it blew up! So we hauled buggy out of there. We told my brother who was in St. Louis. He is in the Air Force. We told him when he called home one night. He didn't believe me. So far he is the only one, except my sister, & 2 cousins who I told. So the next day, my friend and I did a little investigating. We called Pal m Beach airport. We asked them if they sent any balloons up the past 2 weeks. They said NO. Then we called Pal m Beach airport. They said they haven't sent any balloons up the past 2 weeks.
