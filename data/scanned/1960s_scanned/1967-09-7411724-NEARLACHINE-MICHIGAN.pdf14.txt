There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is as follows:

(226) WE WERE SITTING IN A PICK-UP TRUCK PARKED 
ABOUT 200 FEET FROM THE ROAD, JUST WATCHING THE LANDSCAPE. SUDDENLY THE WINDSHIELD WENT UP AND SLID BACK, EXPOSING US TO THE AIR. WE WERE SHOCKED.
THE ROOF THEN WAS PUSHED UP ABOUT A FOOT AND STOPPED. WE COULD SEE THROUGH THE ROOF AND WITNESSED SEVERAL SHAPES MOVING ABOUT.
THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OVAL IN SHAPE.  ABOUT THE SIZE OF A CAR HOOD. IT MOVED DIRECT TO US, THEN IT STOPPED ABOUT 65 FEET IN FRONT OF US. IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT THE WINDSHIELD WENT UP AND THE ROOF STARTED TO GO UP.
A BRIGHT LIGHT APPEARED AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE OBJECT. WE COULD HEAR A FAINT HUMMING SOUND. 
AS CLOSE AS WE WERE, WE DID NOT FEEL INTENSELY HOT OR COLD, JUST A VIBRATION THROUGH THE TRUCK.
SUDDENLY THE OBJECT ROSE STRAIGHT UP OUT OF SIGHT IN ABOUT 2 OR 3 SECONDS. WHILE IT WAS THERE WE COULD SEE THROUGH THE ROOF. AFTER IT WAS GONE THE ROOF AND WINDSHIELD RETURNED TO NORMAL.
WE STAYED IN THE TRUCK FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES BEFORE THE CONSERVATION OF FUNCTION WAS RESTORED.
SENT TO S.O.S.

DEAR SIRS,
THIS STUDY OF AERIAL PHENOMENA IS OF GREAT INTEREST AND FASCINATION. THE DOCUMENTATION YOU COULD SUPPLY WHICH WOULD HELP US UNDERSTAND THESE OCCURRENCES IS URGENTLY REQUIRED. OUR TRAINING PROCEDURES FOR U.S.A.F. OBSERVERS MAY HELP WOULD BE SINCERELY APPRECIATED.
IT IS KNOWN THAT FIELD STUDIES COULD BE APPRAISED IF POSSIBLE TO SUPPLY.
