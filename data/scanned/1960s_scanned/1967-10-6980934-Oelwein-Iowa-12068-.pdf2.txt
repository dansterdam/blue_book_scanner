The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a night sky filled with stars. There are several small, bright objects visible in the sky, which could be UFOs or other astronomical phenomena. However, the image quality is poor and does not allow for a clear identification of the objects.

OELWEIN, IOWA 
On the evening of October 6, 1967, a deputy sheriff on patrol noticed several unidentified objects in the sky over Oelwein, Iowa. He estimated the objects were flying at an altitude of about 2,000 feet. The objects appeared to be round or elliptical in shape and were emitting a bright, white light. The deputy sheriff observed the objects for several minutes before they suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. 

The incident was reported to Project Blue Book, the US Air Force's official program for investigating UFO sightings. An investigation was conducted, but no definitive explanation for the sighting was determined. The case was classified as "unidentified" in the Project Blue Book records.
