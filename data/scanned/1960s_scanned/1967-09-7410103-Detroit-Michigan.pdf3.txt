a strange, highly illuminated object might have been a celestial body. but the brightness seemed extraordinary, and the object appeared to be low on the horizon. it maneuvered strangely, disappearing and reappearing at different positions. the object seemed to be an artificial, self-luminous aircraft, which might have been a spacecraft of some advanced design. it did not resemble any known type of aircraft or celestial body that i am acquainted with. i do not know what the object was, but i feel that it was an unusual and unidentified flying object. the sighting was brief, lasting about 1-1/2 minutes or less. but the object's behavior and appearance were most peculiar.
