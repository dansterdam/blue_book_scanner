Unidentified Flying Object With Bad Smell Reported in Toccoa

TOCCOA, Ga. (UPI)--An unidentified flying object accompanied by an "offensive odor" was reported near the South Carolina border.

Wilford Reid, a police counter intelligence officer, said the object, described as being white and round, came in low over a field and gave off a bad smell. Reid said he and a group of 20 persons observed the object for 10 or 15 minutes as it hovered 75 to 100 feet over the field.

According to Reid, the object appeared to be the size of an automobile and was traveling at about 600 miles per hour. It made no noise and left no trace of its presence, he said.

The incident was reported early Tuesday night, but no explanation of what the object was has been given so far.
