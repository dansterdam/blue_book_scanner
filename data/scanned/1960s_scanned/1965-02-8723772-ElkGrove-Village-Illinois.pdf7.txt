There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter from J. Allen Hynek regarding a UFO sighting in Elk Grove Village, Illinois on February 8, 1965.

Text from the document:

Major Quintanilla
4 June 1965
Elk Grove Village, Ill., February 8, 1965

orange-ish tinge than reported by her reporter and coupled with the fact that the sighting, considerable doubt must be thrown on there having been a separate glowing globe croduced from the setting moon.

NBC wishes me to come in at the end of this documentary to discuss these sightings, as it ought to be easy. Since the Barrington Hills case is a controversial subject, this case at Elk Grove Village is not especially helpful and this is a real puzzler. It is a "Levitlland" case right in our own back yard. It is unfortunate that CHase did not report it officially so that it could have been investigated much sooner than it has been.

Sincerely,
J. Allen Hynek
