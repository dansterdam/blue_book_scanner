"Dear Bill:
Some interesting things happened the night of Sept. 3 in Exeter, N.H.
At about 3:00 AM Patrolman Bertrand Brassard observed a bright reddish-orange object in the night sky. It was estimated to be about 40-50 feet in diameter and it was traveling in a north to south direction. At one point it came to a complete stop for about 30 seconds and then proceeded on its southerly course at a tremendous rate of speed. 
At about 4:30 AM the object was again sighted, this time by Patrolman Eugene Bertrand near Rt. 101 and Epping Rd. He watched the object for about 20 minutes. It moved very slowly at first, then picked up speed and headed northwest at a terrific rate of speed. At one point it hovered over the area for a few minutes then took off. 
At 10:26 PM the same night, September 3rd, the object was again seen by both Patrolmen heading northeast at a fast rate of speed."
