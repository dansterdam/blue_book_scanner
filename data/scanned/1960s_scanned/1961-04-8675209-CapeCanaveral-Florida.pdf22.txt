PAGE TWO REPORT SIC
GET TO RECEIVE THE SECOND INTERROGATION THAT WAS TRANSMITTED. THIS 
PHENOMENA WOULD THUS CAUSE AN IFRPT FLASHING AT 50-70 MILES FROM THE 
COAST AND COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A SEARCH ALONG PHENOMENA. THE 
REASON THAT OUR IPS-23 DID NOT EXPERIENCE THIS ACTIVITY WAS BECAUSE 
WE HAVE OUR RADAR AT 300 P.F. BUT OUR IPS AT 130 P.F. THIS ENABLES 
US TO EXPERIENCE A SECOND OBJECT AT CLOSE RANGE THAT IS STILL THUS, THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE IPS-23 HAD UNKNOWN AND THE 
IPS-23 DID NOT. WE HAVE RECOMMENDED TO WRITE THAT THEY MIGHT TELL 
US MORE COULD BE CONSIDERED AT OUR RADAR COULD BE SOLVED.
HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT GIVE US ANY INTEREST OR BOTH THE INTERROGATIO-
NS FOR THE IPS-23 AS WELL AS FOR THE IPS THE P-1020 WAS RECALLED 
AND ACCOSTED AS SUCH. CONCURRENTLY, THE PILOT LSPC WAS ACCOSTED BY 
MARSHVILLE ON-7 AP.31. THE PILOT LSPC LEAD TO THE LIEUTENANT THAT 
HE SAW THE OBJECT. IT THUS APPEARS THAT THE CUMMULATIVE SIMUL-TANT 
WITNESSES THAT WE HAVE TO PROBLEMS. ONE IS RELATING TO THE INTERROGA-
TIONS PHENOMENA AND THE OTHER OF ACTUAL PERSONNEL OPERATIONS
ALTHOUGH THE ADC ACTIVITY WAS KEPT QUIET DURING THIS PERIOD, THE 
PRESENCE OF ADC WITH HIS HARKINGS COULD CAUSE LACK OF ACTIVITY TO 
BE EXPERIENCED. THIS HINDERING ET IS DISCOURAGED THAT
