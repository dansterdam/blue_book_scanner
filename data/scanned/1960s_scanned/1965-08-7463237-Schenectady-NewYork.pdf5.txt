Dear Mr. Sunderland:

Reference your unidentified flying object observation of 3 August 1965. The information which we received from Griffiss Air Force Base, New York was not sufficient for evaluation. They did not photograph or obtain any additional data. The object was observed at 8:10 p.m. on 3 August for approximately one minute.

The Air Force wishes to thank you for your interest in this program.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM B. QUINTANILLA, JR.
CHIEF, PROJECT BLUE BOOK
