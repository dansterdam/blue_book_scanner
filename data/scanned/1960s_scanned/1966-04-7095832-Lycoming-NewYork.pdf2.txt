34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 6 April 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or is overative explanation of your sighting:

There were several very brightly lighted objects in the sky moving in a very erratic manner. There were at least 3 objects. They were hovering and moving very rapidly from one point in the sky to another point. The objects seemed to be controlled, and were constantly changing course and speed. Their speed was estimated to be around 1000 mph or greater. The objects appeared to be about the size of a small aircraft, perhaps a light plane or helicopter. They were very bright, apparently self-luminous. They illuminated an area of the sky as they moved about. The sighting lasted for about 15 minutes. I have never seen anything like this before, and cannot offer any explanation as to what they were. I am a reasonably skeptical person, and have no preconceived ideas about UFOs, but this sighting has left me quite puzzled.
