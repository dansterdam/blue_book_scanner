The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch appears to be a simple line drawing depicting a circular or disc-shaped object with some additional details.

Around the last week of October, 1966, my wife and I were walking and suddenly spotted some strange still-looking stars. This, however, was nothing of the usual kind. We spotted what still looked like stars but they, all of a sudden, had doubled in size and were rapidly moving around, up and down, and sideways. This was still going on when, the next time I looked, they were gone. The first week of November, 1 had just come back from a visit with my mother. However, this one had and extraordinary light, much brighter than the ordinary one in mid-air. The time: 10:00p.m.

Since the late August. Since not only 1 but many of my friends have spotted numerous UFOs. I feel that I and my friends may have discovered an observation point readily by me.

Also, could you please send me some more information about Project Blue Book, and how I might help you with any observation records made by me.

Thank-you
