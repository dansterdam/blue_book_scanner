However, the report indicates that one or more witnesses felt this identification was incorrect, and viewed the object as something else. Obviously those were the two sons of Ward Campbell. One son apparently had a fairly detailed explanation to offer in support of his contention that the object was not a weather balloon, but rather some other type of aerial object. The report notes that the witness "does not believe the incident was a hoax". It provides that just as the witness was about to reveal what he felt the object was, a sudden noise caused him to step away from the phone and that he was unable to give any further information. The report concludes by stating that the air force was "unable to ascertain the true identity of the object".
