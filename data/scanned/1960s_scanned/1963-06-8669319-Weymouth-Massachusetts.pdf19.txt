On the evening of July 28, 1963 my brother and I interviewed two families on Commercial Street, East Weymouth, Massachusetts in regard to the sighting of an unidentified flying object which was seen, heard, and photographed in the Southshore area during the night of June 25th and the early morning hours of June 26, 1963.

Attached is a photostat of a completed UFO Data Sheet which is based upon a USAF Technical Information Sheet. The drawings on the UFO were done by Mr. Sawatzki as we went through the form together objectively filling in the information. Both Mr. and Mrs. were signed the completed form. The following is a brief account of our interview with them and a family who live next door.
