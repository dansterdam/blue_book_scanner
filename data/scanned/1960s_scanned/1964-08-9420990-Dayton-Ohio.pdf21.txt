The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a sketch or drawing that shows a horizon with an object or objects in the sky. The sketch includes angles and diagrams to describe the motion or appearance of the object(s). There is no photograph present in this particular page.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the horizon high, the object was shown and note how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the horizon where you last saw the object.
28. Draw a curve that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "e" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, show how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and show the direction that they were moving.
