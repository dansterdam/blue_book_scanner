4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: None

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The object was described as "like a light, changing brightness, 1/2th the size of a star". It was observed by one witness at Lynn, Mass. It was described as brillant and swaying from the northwest to overhead and northward slowly. The cause of this sighting is not available. Therefore, it is classed as insufficient information, but probably a balloon.
11. COMMENTS: This object was observed by only one witness and the description indicates that it was a familiar and normal object, such as a star, planet or balloon. It would have been rather dim and swaying in a typical balloon manner. The length of the sighting and the location do not contain sufficient information to establish the nature of this sighting conclusively.
