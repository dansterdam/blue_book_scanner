This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with instructions for drawing a picture that shows the shape of the phenomenon and including any details that might indicate the type of phenomenon observed. There is text at the bottom of the page that asks the observer to estimate the angular size of the object based on a physical reference point, such as a familiar object, and to describe how much of the object was covered by the reference.

The text in the document is as follows:

18. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED. SUCH AS SIZE, COLOR, NUMBER OF PARTS, TRAJECTORIES, AND INDICATE STATUS OR MOTION. TRACE OR SKETCH OUTLINES WHEREVER POSSIBLE.

18. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH OR A PENCIL AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR OTHER SMALL OBJECT. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD. HOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
