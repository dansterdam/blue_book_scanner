This page from a Project Blue Book document contains a sketch and a compass rose diagram, but no photographic image.

The text OCR output is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curve: line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "Y" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass rose to show the direction from which the object came. Place an "B" on the compass rose to show the direction in which the object moved.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

OBJECT MOVED FROM NORTH TO SOUTH, SEEMED TO BE SLIGHT VARIANCES IN SPEED. STOPPED - HOVERED A MOMENT - THEN STARTED SIDE OF EACH OBJECT SEEMED TO DIPPED AND GRADUALLY FADED OUT.

29. IF there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arrayed, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
