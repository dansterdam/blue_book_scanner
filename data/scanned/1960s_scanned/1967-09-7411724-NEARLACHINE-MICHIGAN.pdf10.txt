The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch. The sketch includes a curved horizon line and several angled lines to represent the angle and elevation of the observed object. There is also a compass rose diagram in the top right corner of the image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

90° 75°
60° 45°
30° 
0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

OUR LOCATION IS IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE CORRIDOR.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
