The image contains a diagram that appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The diagram shows a curved line representing the horizon, with instructions to indicate the positions of a sighted object using labeled points on the diagram. There is also a compass rose diagram in the top right corner of the image. However, the image does not contain any photographs.

Transcribed text from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
moved in long circles
29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
