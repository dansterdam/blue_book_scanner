How far away from home were you then?
Only about four-tenths of a mile. And as I then drew back into the driveway and looked up again to bearr I saw that the object was the most incredible thing I had ever seen. The observer who called this up was quite boy was the most incompetent I have seen. The object continued to become more and more brilliantly lit as I watched it. On its upper side it looked so metallic and bright that reflected portions of the sky. On its lower side a rather dullish glow seeming to come from it rather than reflected light from the sky.
As you say, did we say this was hovering about 30° upward? Well, the object itself -- the central portion -- would be 30° and it appeared that, rather than the central portion, was going away, becoming somewhat smaller and lesser in luminosity as if it were receding from the portion visible to the eye. 
But the lower portion of the drawing is near the horizon as far as I could tell. You have the impression that the lower portion was closer -- as I remarked, it appeared to be nearer than was possible, but I think it is -- that this was a meteoric cause of things becoming more and more in your line of sight.
If you had something that was metallic (?) or possibly reflected, although it was light or lack of light -- it could have come in making a vapor trail and thus explode, because this central portion was distinctly a different, difficult, round billow.
Cloud. It actually could explode, they sometimes do, but not in a vapor trail associated with it.
But that would have to be at an altitude higher than where you say you get a vapor trail associated with it.
In the farting a halide out leaves a green trail that looks some things like a contrail, and it is a somewhat curly thing.
I have seen some fairly sizable persons.
