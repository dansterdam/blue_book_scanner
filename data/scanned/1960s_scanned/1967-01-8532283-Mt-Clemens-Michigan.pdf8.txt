MEMO ROUTING SLIP
TO: AFOSR-SRPS
Attn: DR. J. T. RATCHFORD
REMARKS:
Dear Tom,
Please see if you can get some expert opinions with regards to the size of the alleged flying saucer. As you can see from the enclosed photo analysis report, our people at Wright-Patterson are very reluctant to offer a guess as to the actual size of the object. It is all possible pending expert analysis of the photographs. If your friend can come up with some additional measurements the only thing I will be able to give him is that the photo analysis indicates etc, etc, and I would not mention our evaluation. Any thanks for your help in this matter and let me know if you can conclude anything definite is derived from the photos please call and the paper work can follow later.
Thanks
