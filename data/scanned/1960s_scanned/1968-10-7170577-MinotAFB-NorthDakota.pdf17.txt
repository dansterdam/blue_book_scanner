The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, with text describing information to be sent by mail, including a map of the area, flight path of an object, and requests for copies of scope photos from observers.

The text in the document is as follows:

The following is to be sent to us by mail:
Map of area and flight path of B-52 from 0253 hours local, till landing, with time sequence markings on plot.
AF Form 117 from each observer. Could be completed by observers at the time they are interviewed.
Copies of the Scope Photos.
