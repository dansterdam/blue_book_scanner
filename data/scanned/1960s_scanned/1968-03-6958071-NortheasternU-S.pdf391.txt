There are two illustrations present in the image:

1. A compass rose diagram with directional labels.
2. Two sketches of a person standing on a road or path with a landscape in the background.

The text appears to be providing instructions on how to use the compass rose diagram to describe the orientation of a phenomenon when it is first seen and when it is last seen.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will produce all the text found in the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

SA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN
LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION
OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT.
