There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old document with text discussing Project Blue Book and a signature at the bottom.

Doctor J. Allen Hynek who is the Chairman of the Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University is the scientific consultant to Project Blue Book. He has indicated that the proper panel to present this matter should be the one to handle such cases and its proper representative.

Doctor Hynek has discussed this problem with Doctor Winston R. Mac-Laury, the former air force chief scientist.
