ASTRONOMY

Bright Winter Stars Appear

Two planets, Jupiter and Saturn, brighten the November evening skies. . .* Venus just before dawn.

by JAMES STOKLEY

If you look toward the eastern sky on a clear November evening, you will see a region studded with brilliant stars. It shows the "winter face of the sky" - the constellations that dominate the winter heavens. 

highest in the sky is the star Capella, and nearby in the northwest is the famous Pleiades star cluster. Dominating the southern heavens are the two brightest stars of all, Sirius and Canopus. 

The planets Jupiter and Saturn add brightness to this magnificent scene. Jupiter, easily the most striking, shines with a steadier light than the stars, and is less than half the moon's diameter above the horizon. Below it, Saturn appears as a less brilliant, reddish object.

Mars soon after midnight and Venus just before dawn.

While watching the sky in the evening, one also notices that Mars has risen in the east. It can be seen a few minutes before 1 a.m. is seen among the stars of the constellation Virgo. As the morning approaches, the brilliant planet Venus appears above the east-southeastern horizon just 3 or 4 degrees above the point where the sun will rise.
