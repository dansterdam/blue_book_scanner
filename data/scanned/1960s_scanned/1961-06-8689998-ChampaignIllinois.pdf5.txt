The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document.

BOTH OBSERVERS ONE AND TWO REVEALED THAT OBSERVER ONE FIRST SIGHTED THE UFO AND POINTED IT OUT TO OBSERVER TWO. OBSERVER ONE STATES THAT THE OBJECTS WERE IN V FORMATION MOVING FROM SE TO NW AND DISAPPEARED IN APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SECONDS. OBSERVER TWO THOUGH AT FIRST THE OBJECTS WERE A STAR, WAS CONVINCED BY OBSERVER ONE THAT IT WAS UFOS. BOTH OBSERVERS HAD BEEN LYING ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING. SKY CONDITIONS AT TIME OF THE SIGHTING WERE SCATTERED WITH HIGH BROKEN CLOUDS. WIND WAS FROM 272 TO 292 DEGREES. IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE OBJECT SEEN WAS A STAR. BY LOOKING STRAIGHT UP WITH NO REFERENCE POINT IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET THE ILLUSION THAT THE STAR WAS MOVING BECAUSE OF CLOUDS MOVING TO THE SE. CHICAGO CENTER ADVISES THAT THERE WAS NO KNOWN AIRCRAFT TRAFFIC OVER CHAMPAIGN AT THE TIME OF THE REPORTED SIGHTING.
