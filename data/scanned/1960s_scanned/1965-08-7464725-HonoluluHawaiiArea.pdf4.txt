PACAP Base Command (PDT) 1 - 2 August to 5 August 1965

TO: AEDC (FTD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. Following is a summary of UFO activity in the Hawaiian area, 1 August to 5 August 1965. Five UFOs were reported. One of them (part b) apparently was widely dispersed headlights in Hawaii resulting in increased reporting and publicity.

2. On 3 August, 06002 (3/2000 local) a family living in Wahiawa sighted an unusual bright lights moving across the sky at high altitudes and on various headings. The lights appeared to maneuver erratically from red to blue during the sighting. This sighting was made from a position approximately 7 miles from Wheeler AFB and the lights appeared to be about 5 miles away. They were flying over a heavily populated area. 

3. On 4 August, 06447 (3/2044 local) numerous sightings were made of an object which fell from the sky southofDanni. The reports differed on the color but all agreed that it was a very bright light. Two pilots who were flying at 31,000 on the 289 radial 150 NM out of Honolulu VORTAC radar saw it. Both pilots believed that it burned out before hitting the water. It appeared to descend at a steep angle and it seemed to be an entry vehicle. The two pilots thought it could have been from U.S. space operations and it is unlikely that it was Russianin origin. There was a rapidly decaying space vehicle, which fell approximately 150 NM southeast of Oahu.
