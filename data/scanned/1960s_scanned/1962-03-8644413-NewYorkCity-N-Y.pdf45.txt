The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report, possibly related to a UFO sighting or investigation.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"T.S. did you notice the time as the object as it depart. Cannot say more then what you observe. I cannot verify or say what the object might have been. Those are your observations.
It seems strange we did not get more exact measurments or observations of the object. It is most regrettable we did not get more exact information on the size, shape, color and movement of the object. I hope you can get some additional information on this most unusual observation."
