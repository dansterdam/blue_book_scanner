14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object appeared to just disappear rapidly from view, as if it had been turned off or moved away very quickly.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes  No  Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes  No  Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: no particular sound, just a bright light
b. Color: the object was a bright white or silvery light

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how many degrees of arc would the object have subtended? The object subtended an arc of approximately 3-4 degrees, appearing to be about 3-4 times the size of a match head held at arm's length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show the direction the object was moving. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction of arrow.
The handwritten note states: "and stationary most of time, as that was the position of this particular object".
