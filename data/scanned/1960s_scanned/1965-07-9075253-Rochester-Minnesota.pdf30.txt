The image contains a photograph or illustration depicting a sketch or diagram related to a UFO sighting report. The diagram shows the trajectory and movement of multiple objects in the sky, with a compass or directional indicator in the corner.

The text output from the OCR of the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the side that shows how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling. 

THREE SEPARATE SIGHTINGS. EACH TIME. ALL ORIGINATED SAME POSITION.
ALL FOLLOWED SAME PATH.
