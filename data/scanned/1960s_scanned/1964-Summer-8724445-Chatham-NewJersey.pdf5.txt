The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten text document.

Out of nowhere in the northern sky an object this shape appeared and silently moved to the rear and went behind some trees. It was like a blue light, but no trail, just a flash of light in the western sky. It moved very fast. Before anyone could return to see it had disappeared. Not more than 10 seconds. Nothing happened after that. I would have written you that night, but my friend said I was playing a trick on him. That I was wrong and there.
