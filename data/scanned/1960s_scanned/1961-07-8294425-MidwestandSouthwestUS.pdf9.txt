DANGER "UFO'S" IN PENNSYLVANIA: It seems that sightings of unidentified flying objects are still being reported over parts of Pennsylvania, especially in the western and central sections of the state. Reports indicate that individuals have observed strange lights and objects in the sky which appear to be at a high altitude and apparently moving at a rapid rate of speed. Some of the better reports indicate the objects are circular or elliptical in shape, are luminous, and appear to be under intelligent control. In several instances, individuals have reported that the objects emitted a distinct humming sound as they moved through the sky. The objects are usually observed at night and disappear rapidly either by increasing speed or by completely extinguishing their lights. There have been no reports of physical contact or landing of these objects and, as far as can be determined, no damage or other physical evidence has been found. The reported sightings are being carefully investigated by the proper authorities.
