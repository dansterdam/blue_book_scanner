Dear Sir,

Enclosed you will find the testimony of Mr. Elmer C. Rowland, a resident of Arcata, California, regarding his observation of an unidentified aerial object on April 9, 1960. 

Mr. Rowland's description of the object he observed is as follows:

"At approximately 8:00 P.M. on April 9, 1960, while standing on the front porch of my home at 1645 Seventh Street, Arcata, California, I observed a strange aerial object in the sky to the northwest of my location. The object appeared to be circular in shape, and was illuminated with a bright, bluish-white light. It hovered in a stationary position for several minutes, and then began to move in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. As it moved, the object dimmed and gradually disappeared from sight.

"The object was observed for a total of approximately 3 to 4 minutes. It was at an estimated altitude of about 1,000 to 1,500 feet, and the size appeared to be about 50 to 75 feet in diameter. There was no sound associated with the object, and no vapor trail was visible.

"This is the first time I have ever observed anything like this, and I am at a loss to explain what the object could have been. It did not resemble any known aircraft, either military or civilian, that I am familiar with."

I am enclosing three 4x5 photographs which were taken of the object by Mr. Rowland. However, the quality of the photographs is very poor, and little detail can be discerned.

Please let me know if you have any further questions regarding this incident. I would be happy to provide any additional information that may be helpful in your investigation.

Sincerely,
