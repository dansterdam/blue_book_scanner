FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
Jan-Feb 65

The incident happened on a very isolated farm belonging to the Davidson family in Jacksonville, Florida. There were 6-7 people in the house, the evening of January 3, 1963, when they started watching something in the sky. There were four children, ranging in age from 5 to 12 years old. The house is about 25 miles from the city of Jacksonville. A 13-year-old servant girl (a Negro) was the first to see it. She ran into the house and called all the others out to see it. They all witnessed the object.

They said it was round, about 40-50 feet in diameter, and aluminum-colored. It hovered over their field for about 10 minutes, then shot straight up out of sight. The object gave off a red glow on the way up. Husband and wife examined the field the next day, and found four circular indentations about 10 feet apart. The object did not come down or land, but seemed to lift straight off the ground.

The family was greatly disturbed and upset about the incident. The husband, Joe Davidson, who is about 45-50 years old, as is his wife Dora, talked it over very carefully with his wife and children. They are all very reliable and creditable people. The whole family is well known in this area and have an excellent reputation. The husband, who is a tenant farmer on a peanut farm, seems to be a very intelligent man.

The Moreno family, living only a mile from the Davidson farm, also saw the object that same evening. They confirmed the Davidson's story. Several other people in the area also reported seeing the object.

Next day, a police inspector was sent from Jacksonville to investigate, and he seemed satisfied with the report. He said these people were of good reputation and that he could find no evidence of hoax or fabrication.
