1. Reference your recent letter of September 1, 1967. On September 1, 1967, something similar to your report had been visible to the west of Houtzdale, Pennsylvania, which should have been visible slightly to the west of your position. Again, traveling from south to north. ECHO II is considerably brighter than most stars and is easily visible to the naked eye.

2. If you wish to report your observation as an unidentified flying object (UFO), include in your letter complete the attached photographic data sheet and also forward the original negatives in the self-addressed envelope. Your negative will be returned upon completion of analysis.
