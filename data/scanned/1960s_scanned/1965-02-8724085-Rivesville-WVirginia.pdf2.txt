And at Staunton, on Tuesday night, (February 2) three boys saw, and chased, an object 1,000 to 1,500 feet in the air. The object was about 75 feet in diameter and was traveling west to east. It had a brilliant white light at the front and three smaller yellow lights at the rear. It made no sound and left no trail. The sighting lasted about 2 minutes and was observed at 6:20 PM. A full moon was out.
