Text from the document:

As he sped on the object, he only continued to come toward him. The object as described by the man continued about as fast as an airliner at about the same altitude. This was about 1,500 feet. The lights on the object were said to be two large, reddish-orange lights the size of automobile headlights, set side by side. These lights appeared to be lit from the inside and gave off a steady glow. There was no noise, no sound, or at most no sound could be heard. The airplane was flying at about 180 knots and even though he continued to pursue the object, it stayed about the same distance ahead of the plane. Though he tried to gain on it, the object was able to maintain its position. The pilot made repeated passes at the object, but it would not veer off or change course in any way. After about 10 minutes, the pilot had to break off the pursuit and return to the airport as he was running low on fuel.

The object was estimated to be about 40 feet in diameter and the pilot stated that the object appeared to be metallic in color, but he could not be certain. The pilot was not able to get a close look at the object, but did state that it appeared to have no visible markings, wings, or other external features. The pilot stated that this was the most unusual and perplexing experience of his career, and that he could not offer any explanation for what he had observed.
