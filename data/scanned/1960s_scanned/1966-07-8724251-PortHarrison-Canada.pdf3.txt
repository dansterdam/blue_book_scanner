U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE SERVICES ADMINISTRATION

IN REPLY REFER TO: W1321

Major Quintanella

Dear Sir:

Your office was suggested as possibly being able to identify or assist in the identification of the object of the enclosed letter recently received from the Director of the Canadian Meteorological Services.

From the description it would appear that the object was some type of balloon. However, we do not recognize any of any balloons of this type being released in the Northern Hemisphere at this time.

Port Harrison is located due west of Churchill across the Hudson Bay where regular radiosonde balloons are released. These balloons expand to a much larger size at 20,000 feet than is noted in the description and probably would not be mistaken for an unidentified object.

We appreciate any assistance that can be given.

Sincerely,

Special Assistant (SCAR)
Overseas Operations Division
