There is no photograph present in this image from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. The image appears to be a questionnaire with various questions related to the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? "no, only when it disappeared. Then it was there again."
15. Did the object move behind something, or disappear at any time, particularly a cloud?  "No"
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? "Yes"
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: 
a. Sound "silent"
b. Color "white"
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Drawing showing the shape of the object and direction of movement.
