March 24, 1965--Tallahassee, Florida-- Mr. James W. Flynn, 65 of by 12 feet wide, walked about 400 yards, then walked to within 150 yards of a white yellow lighted dome shaped object that had landed. The object emitted a loud whirring noise and had four bright beams of light emanating from it in a clockwise motion. After observing the object for 15 minutes, he was approached by a ground force. When he raised consciousness, the UFO was gone, though a reddish glow remained on the ground where the UFO had been. He called the sheriff's office who investigated and later confirmed his story. The Air Force contacted him and obtained information regarding the incident. Both were wary because of injuries received during the UFO encounter. CASE LOSS. Washington, D.C.
