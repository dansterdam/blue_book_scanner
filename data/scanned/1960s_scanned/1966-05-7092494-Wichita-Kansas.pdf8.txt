AF IN : 55393 (28 May 66)                                               PG 2 of 2

THE FIRST OCCASION A CYLINDRICAL OBJECT FOLLOWED
PAGE 2 RU/TDA726 UNCLAS

A STRAIGHT LINE COURSE, APPARENTLY TUMBLING. THE
SECOND DAY A SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT APPEARED TO GAIN
AND LOSE ALTITUDE. ON BOTH OCCASIONS THE OBJECT FADED FROM
SIGHT AFTER 5 MINUTES OBSERVATION. THE SECOND SIGHTING
WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A RECURRENCE OF THE FIRST.
PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT DURING THE TIME
OF EACH SIGHTING THERE WERE AT LEAST 50 AND 60 
AIRCRAFT, RESPECTIVELY, OVER WICHITA. HOWEVER
EACH WITNESS STATED POSITIVELY THAT THE OBJECT
WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT.
