10. CONCLUSION Aircraft(possible) - The object in the area at the time of the sighting was equipped with two powerful lights for illuminating the wing tips. The object light was first observed to be stationary but then moved off toward the southeast at a white light on a pole one mile away. It was also brighter than the bright star in the western sky at the time. There were no sounds or exhaust associated with the object. Blytheville AFB advised that the KC-135 craft that has a record of sighting this type of UFO report was in the area, that the object departed to the south would indicate the aircraft could have seen this type of object.
