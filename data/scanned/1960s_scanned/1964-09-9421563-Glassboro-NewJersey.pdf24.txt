The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book regarding a UFO incident in Glassboro, New Jersey in 1964.

Text extracted from the document:

A very important point relating to the markings at the site of the landing was the indications found here of the triad system which was apparently used. The radiation effect showed this markings and settled to earth in such a way that they would indicate a weighted down or heavy indentation. No chemical residue of any kind was left behind and the markings were burned only toward the apparent center or hole.

Here a difference is found. In the Glassboro case the indentations were not wedge shaped, but they appeared to be spirally shaped at the bottom. This seems to show something blunted or round at the end made the hole. Again only the center hole was affected by the heat. The markings from the vehicle on the surface were apparently quite slight. The pressure of the vehicle from Kuka was found to have caused three tripod holes about this pressure on the surface. The indications can be found to prove the incident is a hoax.
