Dear sir,
The sightedness or watching of a object of a somewhat spherical or less irregularly formed by the observer approximately 6:10/6:15 pm. The location could be within the outside limits of the city limits. The object was seen to be fairly elevated and in a constant speed towards the northeast. There was no sound and no known color distinction. The object was observed for over a minute and then was lost to view behind blending with the night sky. I hope this information is of some help to your study and research.
