Gentlemen:

1-Kindly send me a "U.S. Air Force Technical Information" set of forms to fill out for a sighting of a U.F.O. in this area.

2-I would also appreciate the name and address of person or Base Reporting this case, containing a radar sighting, which I can call to ask for verification of local sighting, according to their daily log.

In this manner I can determine a true sighting from a hoax.

Also, I desire to pass on information or alert such base or any current sighting and coordinate activities from here to here.

Sincerely yours,
