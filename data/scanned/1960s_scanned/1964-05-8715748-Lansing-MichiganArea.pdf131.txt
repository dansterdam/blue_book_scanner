EXTRACT FROM TELEPHONE REPORT

On 24 June at 0730 am, Sgt Moody met with Bill Povers at the Michigan State Police Headquarters in East Lansing, Michigan. We talked with Corporal Thornton of Michigan State Police regarding a report of a meteor (report of fighting to be covered in Bill Povers' report).

Appointment with Mr and Mrs _____ was arranged. They stopped for breakfast in Grand Ledge. 

1. Interview with Mr and Mrs _____
2. Interview with _____ and _____, residents

Grand Ledge on a farm, we contacted the Army Michigan National Guard. This organization has been requested to make reports on unusual sightings. They also have a group of individuals who have seen similar Unidentified Flying Objects that they do not fly night photo missions with. They have stated that their craft maneuvering capabilities are superior to ours and ours to the Presidents (sic). Persons in the area should be familiar with these craft. Information from the Director indicated that our Airport photo service at Capitol City Airport might have information regarding craft sightings in the area.

AT 0300 HOURS, 22 May 64th, Mr and Mrs _____ reported that an unusual object was observed from their upstairs bedroom window. This object was described as circular, 40-50 feet in diameter, red in color with four red lights flashing on and off and one white light steady and intermittent on its underside. This object was about 500-700 feet from their point of observation. Stars were out and no moon. No wings or other features were noticed on the object.

About ten minutes later the object reappeared according to the same witnesses. This time the object was slightly higher from the ground and moving from the observers. Again, the duration was short, less than one minute. The size and color characteristics of the first sighting were described. Time of the first sighting was estimated at 30 to 60 seconds. The second observation was described as sharp and pitched white, compared to the first sighting on a detailed track.
