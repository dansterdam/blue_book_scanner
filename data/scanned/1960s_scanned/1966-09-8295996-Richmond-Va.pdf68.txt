Strange Object Band

A clear night, and an American on the ground in Virginia related the following: He said he witnessed an object like a baton or band or ribbon which hovered and moved over a field for several minutes. The object was long, cigar-shaped, giving off a bluish light. One man reported it as very high up and others said it was low. It was visible for about ten minutes.

The report stated that the pocket watch of a witness was stopped. It was a very bright light, blue-green in color, and about 50 to 75 feet long. The object made no noise and moved in a straight line. No details of a structural nature were observed. The object appeared to be about 30 feet off the ground and hovered and moved very slowly, sometimes downward slightly, and then back up, maintaining generally the same altitude. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes before disappearing at a high rate of speed.
