6 November 1961: About 1900 hours, a pilot observed a light but bright trail in the sky off the Pacific horizon. The trail was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes and then disappeared. The pilot was returning to Del Mar, California. This was observed in the North East sky from the parking lot of the County Del Mar Racing location. There was nothing unusual about the light and it was initially thought to be an airplane. No further investigation was done.  

8 November 1961: About 2100 hours, the observer reported another unidentified sighting. The sighting had a signature identical to that observed on 6 November 1961 and was observed in the same general area. The object appeared to be moving at a higher velocity than normal jet aircraft and made no sound. It was observed for approximately 2 minutes and then disappeared. No further investigation was conducted.

The document describes in detail the sightings on November 6 and November 8, 1961 near Del Mar, California. It provides information about the time, location, and characteristics of the unidentified objects observed.
