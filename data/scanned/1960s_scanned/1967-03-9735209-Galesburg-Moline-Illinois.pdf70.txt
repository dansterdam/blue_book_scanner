Sneer if you will. 
You are not going to convince persons in this
area who sighted unidentified flying objects that they
are candidates for the "booty hatch."
No matter if the reports vary -- 
Eight millimeter movie film from "sauce type" to "boxcar" is in the area, F. W. Crane, a Moline policeman, who was carrying the film, shows a clear silhouetted object, clearly visible in the sky. The film was made by I. M. Fuller, a Moline policeman, who was carrying the film, shows a clear silhouetted object, clearly visible in the sky. The film was made by I. M. Fuller, a Moline policeman, who was observing the same object.
