COMMENTS OF INVESTIGATOR
Mrs. [redacted] stated she first noticed the object in the sky while stopped in her automobile at the stop sign on Maguire Blvd. and Edgewater Drive which is the way entrance to her home. Upon arriving home, her son and her neighbor, Mrs. [redacted], also observed the object. The boys got up a "very" telescope in the open field adjacent to the residences and observed the object. Mrs. [redacted] stated that the boys said the object was moving in a north westerly direction being barely perceptible. The boys stated that through the telescope they could see the colors and erratic movement, up and down and from side to side. All of the observers agreed that the object had been sighted before and that it was not a usual phenomenon, but did not venture a statement as to what the object might be, but did state they had heard a lot about UFOs. Mr. [redacted] and her son said he was at home during the time of the sighting but was not interested in going out to look. It was present at the time of the interview.
SUMMARY: I checked the area in the vicinity of the [redacted] home and approximately the same route Mrs. [redacted] had covered on her way home. I believe there are probably only a very few trees obstructing the view in the direction from which the object was reported. I believe there are possibilities that seekers or unduly concerned with "Flying Saucers" believe them to be of average intelligence and are convinced the object was there. The only opinion I might offer is that the object could have been similar to a weather balloon at a very high altitude drifting slowly northwest.
