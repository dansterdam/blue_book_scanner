No Case (Information Only)                                                 28 July 1962
Paran√°, Argentina

P.s: On July 26th at 2135 a man traveling in a car saw an odd luminous object passing high overhead and heading in an ENE direction at a speed estimated to be several times faster than any conventional aircraft. The object was a very intense bluish-white color and was glowing brightly. It appeared to be circular in shape and had a diameter estimated to be about 15 to 20 feet. It seemed to be emitting a beam or ray of light from its underside, which caused the ground and trees below to be illuminated in a bluish-green color.

The witness stated that the object was noiseless, and appeared to change direction slightly during the course of its flight. After traveling for about 3 or 4 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated to an extremely high speed and disappeared from sight.

The witness stated that he has observed many aircraft both military and civilian, and that this object was unlike anything he had ever seen before. He described it as being a most peculiar sight, and stated that there were several other persons who also observed the object, and who confirmed his description of it.
