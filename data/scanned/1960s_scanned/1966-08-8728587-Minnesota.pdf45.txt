Additional Comments:
Just before sunrise, a fairly pronounced temperature inversion developed over much of Minnesota. This type of inversion results in bending of light rays, much like a mirage, but never reaches the point of optical distortion resulting in an image itself significant [sic] unless a factor of mass or volume of intensity is added. The inversion definitely existed, having been observed and confirmed by competent Weather Bureau personnel over an extensive area. The phenomenon resembles many observations from Arizona and New Mexico in the early 1950's - the applying ground aroma.
