The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an official file copy of a letter from the U.S. Air Force regarding a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

TD-R/Lt Col Friend/mb/69216
UFO Sighting

31 January 1963

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your recent letter of 25 January 1963 to Dr. Hynek has been referred to us (TD-R) for attention and reply.

The negative in question was forwarded to us by the US Photographic Interpretation Center, and it was to be returned to you, and it was, therefore, retained in our files. Now, however, we are returning the negative and are including with it's print and an enlargement.

Photo analysis indicates that the object is the most probable cause of the sighting.

We appreciate your interest in the U.F.O. program and thank you for your cooperation with the Air Force on this matter.

Sincerely,
[signature]
Eric ERIC NORCROSS
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Science and Components
