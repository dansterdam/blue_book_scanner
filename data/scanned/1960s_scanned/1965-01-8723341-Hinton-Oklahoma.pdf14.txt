Dear Mr. ,

This is in reply to your letter of January 20 in which you related an observation of several objects which you could not identify.

In order for the Air Force to evaluate your report, the available UFO data on the objects will need to be completed. The Air Force will then evaluate the report, and you will be advised of the findings.

Sincerely,

JOHN R. SPAULDING
