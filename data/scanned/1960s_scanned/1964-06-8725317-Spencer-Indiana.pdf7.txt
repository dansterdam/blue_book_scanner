"Some concerned citizens, including Elliott Spencer, have been talking to him and asking him where he can go from here on this case from Elliott Spencer. It seemed very mysterious how the lights would appear and disappear at a house. They were hoping that the Air Force and the government would take some real interest in this case and try to find out what was happening. There were many witnesses to these mysterious lights. It seemed to me that this was a case that should have been investigated further by the Air Force. There were many sincere people involved in this case who were concerned and wanted some answers. The witness, Mrs. ____, seemed very honest and I would appear apprehensive that nothing more was done about a case of this nature when there were so many witnesses."
