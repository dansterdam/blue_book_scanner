"Welles came across about 10:20 PM. They shined their lights on the craft and discovered the lights from the craft disappeared. There were at least 3 people in the craft that could be seen. The craft hovered silently and did not make any sound. After about 1 hour, the lights came on again and the craft slowly rose straight up until it disappeared from view. My witnesses gave full reports to the State Police Station and I spent most of the morning contacting them in their homes and interviewing them as to the details of their sightings. All the witnesses are reliable people of good standing who could not be influenced by any self-serving motives. The craft was described as elliptical or oval in shape, about 30 feet in diameter, aluminum or light grey in color, and absolutely silent in operation. It hovered about 30 feet above the ground and the witnesses could see no protrusions, wings, markings, or any other details that would identify the craft."
