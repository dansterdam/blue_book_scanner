Project Blue Book
A night - pattern air force
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:
I have just finished reading "The Report" on the unidentified flying object by the former head of Project Blue Book, Edward J. Ruppelt. My friend (Charles Ambrogi) and I were always interested in U.F.O.'s.
I am writing this in behalf of my curiosity about what we have definitely ascertained as facts about the existence of these objects and what the scientific community is now doing to try to solve this mystery. Since the existence of these objects has been established beyond reasonable doubt, I think we are entitled to know.
