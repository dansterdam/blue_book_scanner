There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document containing text about various aspects of a project, including telemetry, optics, and data analysis. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output the text found in the document:

2. Telemetry
The engineering problems associated with the transmission of important flight and space measurement data from the vehicle are not serious, except, possibly, for those relating to altitude and power limitations. We merely mention the subject because there will be an early need, and more importantly, because nearly every element of the experiment must be considered in the design of the telemetry equipment.

3. Optics
Like telemetry, the optics planned for the experiment are quite conventional. We will need several cameras using standard bubble-chamber film, so that the data may be scanned on existing equipment. Possibly one of the cameras will be used to photograph the spark chambers in the momentum analyzer and another will be used in conjunction with the wide gap spark chamber to obtain stereoscopic photographs. In the latter case, we plan to provide polar access through the chamber magnet for photography. (The recent rapid strides being made in "filmless spark chambers" may obviate the need for cameras to record the position of sparks in the upper, narrow-gap chambers.)

4. Data Analysis
For the most part, there are no major new problems involved in the scanning or measurement of photographic records which are recovered from a balloon flight. The wide-plate spark chamber will produce photographs that are easily scanned and measured on the standard bubble chamber analysis equipment. Spark chamber photos of the type required for use in the emulsion measurements need be measured in only one coordinate to moderate precision. Although this could be done on standard bubble chamber measuring machines, it would probably be more
