The image does not contain any photographs, only text in a form-like layout. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

EAST OR WEST -

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? SIZE LARGER THAN FAMILIAR OBJECT.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with an known object near the object. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

MUCH LARGER

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? LIKE A LIGHT WENT OUT.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
