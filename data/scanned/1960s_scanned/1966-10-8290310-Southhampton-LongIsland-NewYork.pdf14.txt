There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing text and tables. 

The text output is as follows:

thus li. 14.i9.
Right ascension was computed by first measuring the location of the
end of the moon-trail relative to a line drawn at right angles to the star-
trails; in this way the relative right ascension of the image of the moon
could be found. The position of the center of the moon was estimated by
centering a line as long as the star-trails on the elongated image, and
then picking one end of that line as the starting-position of the moon's
center. The difference in right ascension was not corrected for curvature
of the right-ascension lines, the declination being sufficiently close to
zero that little convergence would be expected. The measured difference
was again corrected for plate scale and off-axis angle, with the result
that the moon's right ascension at the start of the exposure was found to
be 2h 01m.
From the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac for 1966, the
following table of apparent lunar coordinates was taken; all entries are
for 29 October 1966:
UT    EDST (Oct.29)    RA    DEC    RA error    DEC error
0200    10:00 PM    2h 55m 09s    +10째 43' 47"    +2m 06s    +30'
0300    11:00 PM    2h 01m 01s    +10째 56' 49"    +1m 16s    +37'
0400    12:00 PM    2h 06m 33s    +11째 09' 47"    -1m 35s    +05'
By a simple interpolation formula, the time was found when the
absolute amount of error was the same, in minutes of arc, in both directions:
Time: 0332 UT, or 11:32 PM EDST, Oct. 29th
RA: 2h 02m 05s (12 minutes of arc high)
DEC: 11째 03'8 (11 minutes of arc low)
