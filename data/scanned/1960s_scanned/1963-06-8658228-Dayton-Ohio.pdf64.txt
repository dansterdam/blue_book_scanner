The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" and "B" marked on it, illustrating how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows two larger sketches, one depicting a rural landscape with trees and buildings, and the other showing a smaller landscape in the distance. There are no photographs present in this image.

32.  In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33.  In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
