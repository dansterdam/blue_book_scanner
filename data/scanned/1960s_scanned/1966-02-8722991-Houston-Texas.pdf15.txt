1. Earlier this year, Dr Lt Marco Marino, started a project in the Air Material Command, Directorate of Intelligence, USAF. This project was to secure the names and locations of ALL Air Force personnel and civilian employees who had reported any VISUAL ENCOUNTERS during the weather data about a month ago but did not have time to devote to data analysis in the data.
