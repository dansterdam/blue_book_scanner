Dear Sirs, Evansville, Ind. 2/7/64
The thing that may friend and I observed is described in this letter. 
It was about 7:05 P.M., brighter than a star (white), round in shape, we saw it come out of a big cloud and it was at a 45 degree angle from me, and it went down and it was at a 3,569 mile an hour. My friend and I just stared pleasing.
