I can't say for sure what I saw. It appeared a little like a star or planet but some things seemed different, like I had never seen anything quite like it before. There were some strange movements which I felt at the time could not be accounted for by any known astronomical object or aircraft. I reported this sighting to the air force and they were very interested in it. Their investigators came to my home and interviewed me in detail about what I had observed. They told me they felt the sighting had real merit and that they would investigate it further.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?  
The reporting of this sighting was made [Redacted] to the U.S. Air Force in Washington D.C.
