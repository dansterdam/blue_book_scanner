STATEMENT OF U.F.O. SIGHTING BY JOHN R. WEITLICH RM3 359-22-66 USCO:

WHILE STANDING ON THE BRIDGE ON QUARTERMASTER WATCH AT 0125S ON THE MORNING OF 3/22/66, I HAD BEEN STARING UNTHINKINGLY OUT THROUGH THE PORT-HOLES WHEN I NOTICED THAT THE LIGHTS IN TWO HOUSES ABOUT 100 YARDS APART FROM EACH OTHER AND APPROX ONE MILE DISTANT FROM OUR SHIP, BLINKED ON AND OFF VERY RAPIDLY AND AT AN INTENSITY EXTREMELY BRIGHTER THAN NORMAL, AS IF THESE TWO HOUSES IN PARTICULAR WERE COMPLETELY FLOODED FROM WITHIN BY FLUORESCENT LIGHTS. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS, ALL POWER WAS CUT IN THE AREA WHICH I NOTICED AFTER A TREMENDOUS BLUE FLASH OF LIGHT HAD OCCURRED APPROX CENTER OF THESE TWO HOUSES. TO GET A CLEARER LOOK AT THE SITUATION, I THEY WENT OUT TO THE PORT SIDE WING OF THE BRIDGE AND NOTICED A DISTINCT WHITISH GLOW ABOUT 45 DEG TO THE RIGHT OF WHERE I HAD NOTICED THE BLUE FLASH. THIS OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT FROM 300 TO 500 FEET ABOVE GROUND AND EMITTED AN "EERIE" GLOW OF WHITE LIGHT THAT APPEARED TO PULSATE IN ITS INTENSITY. I MUST SAY NOW THAT I TRIED TO KID MYSELF INTO BELIEVING THIS WAS AN OCCURRANCE OF SOME EARTHLY FORM BUT RULED THIS OUT AND INFORMED MY SUPERIORS WHO WAS SITTING IN THE RADIO SHACK AT THIS TIME, THAT I SAW A U.F.O. AND I THEN POINTED IT OUT TO HIM. I WAS ORDERED TO IMMEDIATELY GET A CAMERA BUT UPON MY RETURN THE U.F.O. HAD DISAPPEARED, THUS MY STORY ENDS HERE.
