DEC - 8 1965

Dear Mrs. -------,

The parachute which was recovered near Vero Beach, Florida, was manufactured by the G. T. Schjeldahl Company, Northfield, Minnesota. This particular balloon was probably launched from Cape Kennedy in preparation for the Gemini 5 launch.

The Schjeldahl Company has supplied approximately 1500 of these meteorological balloons to the United States Air Force. They are meteorological balloons which collect data on temperature, pressure, and density of the atmosphere prior to a launch. Balloons of this type are launched as frequently as every 3 minutes during the launch phase of these balloons primarily and up over the water due to a specific recovery pattern.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
