UFOs Whiz Over Danvers, Peabody
Wakefield, Mass. - Several persons in the Danvers-Peabody area reported seeing unidentified flying objects shortly before midnight Sunday.
Mr. & Mrs. Ronald Fisher of 27 Garden St., Danvers, told the News that they were among those who watched the objects for about 30 minutes.
"We were just sitting on the porch when these things came over. There were 3 or 4 of them, round and white, about the size of a basketball. They were going very fast, much faster than any jet, and changing directions very fast. They would stop suddenly, then shoot off in another direction. We called the police but they did not come out. We watched them until they went out of sight to the south."
The objects were also reported seen by Leonard Collings and Bruce Benoit of Peabody. Collings told the News that he and Benoit were standing in the doorway of the Howard Johnson's restaurant on Route 1 in Peabody when they saw the objects.
"They were tremendous objects, hundreds of feet in diameter, with green lights all around and a dome on top. They moved up and down, and sideways, much too fast for any known aircraft. We watched them for about 10 minutes before they went out of sight to the south toward Danvers."
