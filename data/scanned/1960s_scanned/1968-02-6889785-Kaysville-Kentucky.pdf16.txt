HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" TO INDICATE THE POSITION WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW A STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG LINE TO INDICATE THE COURSE TAKEN BY THE PHENOMENON. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO DO THIS.
