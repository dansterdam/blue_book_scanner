Sir
This would refer to my letter of March 31, 1966.

In response to the information given, it is possible I have on several occasions had the experience of matching an occurrence with the information received from military or civilian intelligence.
To anyone interested, it would appear to be ridiculous. However, I cannot validate the response mentally as the signals received was about 11:30 PM Wednesday, March 30, 1966. I noticed as I was reading the article in the magazine I had difficulty seeing. I said nothing, I knew what was aboutto begin. My husband said, "That's something I've never seen." I took a look at it.
