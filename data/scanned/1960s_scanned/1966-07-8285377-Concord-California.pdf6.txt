The image does not contain any photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch shows a horizon line, with an object above it at various angles (0°, 15°, 30°, etc.). There is also a compass rose at the bottom of the image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the curve to show where the object entered the path, and a "B" or the end of the path, and place an arrow to show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
