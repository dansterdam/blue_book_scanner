Request for UFO Information on Sighting, 1 Sep 66.

Hq USAF (SAFODI)
Attn: Mrs. J. Hunt

Reference the attached letter requesting information on sighting.
The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear Mrs. Hunt,
Reference your letter of 3 September 1966 concerning your observation of an unusual phenomena over the Tulsa skies on the night of 1 September 1966.

Your sighting has been studied in detail and we have determined that you probably observed the planet Venus traveling in an east direction. The description you provided indicates that the sighting was of a bright, star-like object in motion. Indeed, observations show that the fluctuations are assigned to meteorological conditions.

FOR THE COMMANDER

WARREN B. WHEELER, Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Technology and Evaluation
