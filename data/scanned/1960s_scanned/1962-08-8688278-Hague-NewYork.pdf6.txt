The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to NASA in Washington, D.C. from someone at Camp Areley in Hague, New York.

The text of the letter is as follows:

NASA 
Washington, D.C.
Gentlemen:

On August 3, 1962 at exactly 10:35 PM EDST two flying objects were spotted over upstate New York. They were flying the southeast and were visible for about three minutes. According to the New York Times, the only satellite scheduled to be visible was Echo over New York City at 8:55 PM EDST. 

I am quite certain on the sightings, as the objects were quite close and appeared to think and also because of a dipping motion it seemed to have, as it disappeared over the horizon.

Would you please try to identify these UFO's. I was thinking that one or both of them might belong to the U.S.S.R. If so, would you please explain why they both appeared at the same time with practically the same course and speed?

I would appreciate a prompt reply. Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

Camp Areley
Hague, New York
(Near Ticonderoga, N.Y.)
