This may not be of much importance to you but for me it is.
I sighted what I beleive to be a large orange object moving at a high rate of speed over the Speedway, Indiana area on April 9, 1965. It appeared to be round in shape and was extremely bright. I observed it for about 3 or 4 minutes before it disappeared from my view. The object was moving at a very high rate of speed and was well above the horizon. At no time did I see any trails or exhaust coming from the object. It appeared to be self-luminous. The weather at the time was clear and the object was easily visible against the sky. I would estimate its size to be comparable to a small aircraft, perhaps a light plane or small jet, but it was definitely much larger and brighter than any aircraft I have ever seen. I was able to observe it quite clearly and have no doubt that it was not a conventional aircraft. I would appreciate if you would investigate this sighting and let me know if you have any other similar reports from the area. Please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions.
