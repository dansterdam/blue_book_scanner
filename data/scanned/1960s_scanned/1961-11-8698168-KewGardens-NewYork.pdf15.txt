Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your recent letter to the Office of Aerial Phenomena, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base concerning unidentified flying objects, has been referred to this office for reply. 

Since your letter contained insufficient information upon which to base a conclusive determination, I am enclosing two questionnaires for your completion. When they have been filled out, please forward them in the enclosed pre-addressed envelopes.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
