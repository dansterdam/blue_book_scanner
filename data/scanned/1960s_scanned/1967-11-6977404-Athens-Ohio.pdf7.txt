The image appears to feature a hand-drawn sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch shows an oval-shaped object with an indicated direction of movement (shown by an arrow) and some form of exhaust or vapor trail underneath it.

Here is the text from the document:

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT
HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE
DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET
LAMP OR THE MOON. NOW HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAD
BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE
PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
