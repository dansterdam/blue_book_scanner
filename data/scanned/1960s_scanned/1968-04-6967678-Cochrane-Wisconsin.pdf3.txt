This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten report or account describing an observed UFO sighting.

The text of the document is as follows:

"I had to bend forward towards the wheel a bit to get a still better view of the same. It seemed to just sit there without moving for some time. Then it turned on its side and descended very quickly until it was out of sight. The thing seemed to disappear below the horizon very quickly - a blink of an eye and it was gone. The size of the object would compare to a volleyball, and the color was a metallic silver or gray. I am quite certain that the object traveled at an extremely high rate of speed when it turned on its side and descended. It appeared to have been hovering for some time, but when it turned on its side and descended, it left within a second or two. There were no engines, fins, or other appendages visible. The motion was very smooth and silent. There was no sound at all that I could hear. As far as I am concerned, this is the most unusual thing I have ever witnessed. I am quite certain that this was no conventional aircraft, but rather something out of the ordinary. I feel that what I saw was a real and accurate sighting of an unidentified flying object."
