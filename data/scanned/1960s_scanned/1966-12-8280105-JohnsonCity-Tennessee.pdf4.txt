Extracting the text from the document:

On the evening of December 8, 1966 while returning home from work at about 9:15 pm, I observed an object in the sky which appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length. It was very close and moving slowly in an easterly direction. It was hovering at an altitude of approximately 800 to 1000 feet. The object had a fluorescent like glow and appeared to be of a metallic construction. It made no sound as it moved across the sky. It was a clear night with a bright moon. I observed the object for approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute before it suddenly went into a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight in a northeastern direction.
