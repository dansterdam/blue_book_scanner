NO CASE (Information Only)	3 September 1962
San Francisco, California

The sighting of a strange aerial phenomenon occurred over the Pacific Ocean approximately 300 miles west of San Francisco, California. It was visible for nearly 3 hours and was observed by a number of aircraft in the area. It was described as a bright light, possibly a flare, drifting over the area and then hovering in the sky. The object remained stationary in the sky for over an hour, then split into two parts and moved off rapidly in opposite directions. No sound was heard and no trail was left behind. The object was observed by several aircraft crews and they will be evaluated more thoroughly.
