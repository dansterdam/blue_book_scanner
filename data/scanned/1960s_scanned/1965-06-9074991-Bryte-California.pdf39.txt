THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT I, the undersigned, individually and solely, am the source on the information contained in this report.

As prescribed by MAJOR J. L. DAVIDSON, AF, SAC, this report is being submitted on my own volition. I am not under any pressure to report my observations, nor are there any physical effects, psychological effects, or after effects. I am submitting this report voluntarily.

The incident described in this report began at approximately 2:30 A.M. June 9, 1965, at Fair Oaks, California. I observed two objects cross the sky from east to west in less than ten minutes.

At this time, it appears there would be another similar sighting. If this is the case, the witness requests that further information be obtained.
