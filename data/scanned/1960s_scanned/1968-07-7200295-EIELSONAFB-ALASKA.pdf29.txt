TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

WHAT CAN THE ANGULAR SIZE HOLD A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT WITH A 
KNOWN DIAMETER TELL US ABOUT THE UNKNOWN OBJECT.  IT TELLS US THE ANGULAR SIZE OF 
THE UNKNOWN OBJECT.  THEN BY MEASURING THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE OBJECT, USING A MATCH 
AS A REFERENCE, WE CAN CALCULATE THE DISTANCE TO THE OBJECT USING BASIC TRIGONOMETRY.
