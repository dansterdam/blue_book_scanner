The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with a series of questions and responses related to the sighting of an unidentified object.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? NO

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): (Yes) No Don't Know. 
IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: like that of a helicopter
b. Color: It was solid, with a glaring color
c. Size: Like that of a small automobile

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please on arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
