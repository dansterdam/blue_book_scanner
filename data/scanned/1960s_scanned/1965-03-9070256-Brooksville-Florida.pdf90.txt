REQUEST/UFO
REQUEST: Analysis of Unknown Materials

Dr. John Strange,
Vice President,

Tougaloo, MS

Dear Dr. Strange,

The pieces of material which were allegedly dropped by a "flying saucer" near Brooksville, Florida according to a recent Blue Book determination, are being forwarded to you for analysis. The analysis of these UFO specimens is related to the security of the United States and to the public interest. The signed paper clippings will explain the sighting as the observer reported it.

I believe that the two pieces of material which were allegedly dropped by the "flying saucer" are of great interest and could give us an important clue as to the identity of the UFO. I would appreciate your performing the following:

a. What type of paper or material are these pieces composed of?
b. The nature of the ink or graphic on the specimen.
c. Are there similar types of this material manufactured in the United States?
d. Can you perform a chemical analysis of the fibers?
e. Can you determine whether the material is made in the United States and where?

Due to the publicity which this sighting has received and the nature of the objects, I would be most happy to give your company credit for performing the analysis if you so desire. I would appreciate your expediting this analysis of the material in all of the ways mentioned above.

Sincerely,

INSPECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.
