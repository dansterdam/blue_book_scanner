The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book photo analysis report.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
DATE OF REPORT: 20 August 1964
SUBJECT: UFO
LOCATION: Albuquerque, New Mexico
DATE: 16 June 1963
PHOTOGRAPHY: Quality - Fair to Good
FMB - Photos returned to TDMI.
1. PURPOSE: This report answers WD #64-72 from Major Quintanilla (TDMI) to determine if an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) is a hoax or real.
2. ANALYSIS: The photographs have a sky background with an unobstructed view of the object. It seems unlikely that anyone photographing a UFO from several angles would have all good clear images.
The photograph #7 shows the UFO at close range with a leafless branch on the left side of the object. The two branch are not obscuring the image of the object. It is possible that these twigs are from the tree on the right which are further away. Therefore, the object appears to be a sharper image than the near and far parts of the photograph.
In photographs #1 and #2 the object appears to be a sharper image than the near and far parts of the photographs. This indicates the UFO is between the three and the camera.
