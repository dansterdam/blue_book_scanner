MAN RECOUNTS RUN-IN WITH STRANGE ROBOT
BROOKSVILLE, FLA. - A strange incident at which a "flying saucer"-shaped robot was encountered and described in detail by the witness took place here Wednesday afternoon, according to the report.
The witness, a local man, said that while walking near some woods he spotted a "strange" object on the ground about 100 yards away. As he approached it, he said, a robot-type creature emerged from behind some bushes and walked toward him. The witness said the creature was a metallic, disc-shaped object about 10 feet in diameter and 7 feet high. It had protrusions on its upper surface resembling "guns." The witness said he could hear a "whistling" noise as the creature approached him. The witness said he became frightened and ran away, but returned later with some friends. They found the impressions left by the creature's feet in the soft ground. The Air Force has been notified of the incident, and Project Bluebook at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is investigating.
