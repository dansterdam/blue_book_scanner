On Dec. 4, 1967 while I was driving home from work in Indianapolis, I saw another object the same size and shape as the one 30/11/60.

2 miles south of Franklin, Ind. at 7:10 in evt. It was about 500 ft. high, traveling at a speed slightly less than 4 mile west of U.S. 31.

It was in view for 10 min. Just long enough to realize a log-mile away. From time to time it appeared to pivot slightly about 3 ft. diameter. The craft was round with a halo around it 30-50 mph in a parallel flight over the ground not bouncing or anything.

At times it flattened out in a horizontal position and at times banks to show its concave underside. As it moved some distance directly toward my car, it didn't seem to dazzle my headlights. A Intensity with a 3 point star below.

Just before I lost sight of the object, it seemed to drop down in landing or something.
pattern-like - NW and Flew away N.W.

at a great speed.

I did not report this until today to the authorities because I was reluctant to do so due to the fact that something to say. It doesn't seem incredible.
