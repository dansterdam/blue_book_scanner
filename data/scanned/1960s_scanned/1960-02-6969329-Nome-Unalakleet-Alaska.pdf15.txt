Dear Colonel Isbell,

Your letter of January 17th, received, and I do appreciate your taking the time to write me. It is rather a disappointment to me to learn that the object which we witnessed on January 7th was not an astronomical engine, however, I have a strange feeling that the object was in some way connected with some kind of a vehicle and that the object was a manned aircraft.

The descriptions given by the various observers are quite similar, and I well recall the relative size and speed of the object as it passed over my home. I wouldn't like to have it be better to deal with it as some kind of a phenomena, but I am quite convinced that what we saw was some kind of a craft of the same type as described in your letter, which moved with great speed and gave off no sound.

I am writing to ask if it would be possible for me to get any additional information, other than that contained in your letter, regarding this incident? There has been some interest from the people of this community, and I feel that any information I could give them would be appreciated.

I fully realize that this was not a too detailed study, and I can well appreciate the difficulties involved in properly identifying some of these things which I am told are fairly common. However, I do feel that the object we saw was a maneuverable craft of some kind, and if there is any additional information that you could give me, I would be most grateful.

Thank you again for your courtesy and cooperation. I will be most pleased to hear from you further.

Sincerely yours,
