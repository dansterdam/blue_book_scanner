NOTES ON SAUCER
(Continued from Page 1)

That he was "in a state of shock". The vision time averaged about three minutes. 
Deputy Lee was called by an Army Intelligence officer from Chicago and questioned extensively about the incident. 
The deputy said he would probably need more Polaroid film, since some of those seeing the object were taking pictures.
The object was seen by many persons, both military and civilian, and several took photographs.
The saucer was said to be 40 to 60 feet in diameter, bright, metallic-looking, and elliptical in shape. It moved in a north-easterly direction and was seen for several minutes.

The deputy said he had received over 20 telephone calls and letters, with information and questions about the object, as he had gone through a similar experience him.
Another man, Harold Solem, is an enthusiastic amateur photographer. He told Deputy Lee that it was an Unidentified Flying Object. He said he could not believe his eyes, but took several pictures of it as it passed overhead. Mr. Solem wrote: "The object maintained the same speed and altitude throughout the two to three minutes I observed it. It gave no indication of engines or fuel or operators or stabilizers. The only sound was a very faint hum. This was no conventional aircraft, but something very strange and highly technical, far ahead of us. I am convinced, after having seen it, that we are not alone in this universe."
