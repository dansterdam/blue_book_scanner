The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or letter discussing a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

Dear Sir:

There is a letter of unknown date which states that on Jan 29, 1968, at about 4:30 p.m., an unknown object was observed flying above at a high altitude. It was described as having a metallic appearance and reflecting sunlight. The object was viewed for several minutes by a number of observers, and its movements indicated it was under intelligent control. The middle layer is said to be brighter than the ends. The bottom layers are thinner than the top. It appears to have been stationary and observable to the naked eye at the time of observance. The names of the observers are redacted from the text.
