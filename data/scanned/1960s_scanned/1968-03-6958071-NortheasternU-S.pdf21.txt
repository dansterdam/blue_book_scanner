The image does not contain any photographs, but rather text handwritten on a document. The text appears to be a report or request for information on a sighting of a "future lighting", and discusses observations and reasons why people did not attempt to capture or document this event further.

Please send me information on what the do in the event of a future sighting. I have often wondered about reports of landings, why people did not shoot at them or attempt to capture or something. I think some effort should be made on the part of sighting to obtain proof and detail information on what takes place since he is the only one around.
