The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather a diagram with sketches and instructions. The diagram shows a compass rose and instructions for determining the position and motion of an observed object in the sky, using angles and compass directions.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969. This page appears to be part of a questionnaire or form used to collect information from eyewitnesses about their UFO sightings.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
