The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, specifically from the report with the filename 1967-03-9734540-Dayton-Ohio.pdf33.txt.

The text found in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 25 DAY MARCH 1967 YEAR

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

This object, although appearing to be quite high, would have been a very short distance from the observer if it had been a hovering helicopter with the flashing lights turned on. It did not exhibit the object number of times it flashed each moment, but it was not a regularly occurring flash which one would anticipate. This is my guess that the flash occurred something like 15 to 30 times a minute. Once or just a bit it was very difficult to locate again, and it soon pretty well in a clear blue sky.
