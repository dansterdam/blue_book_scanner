COURSE:
K. THIS REPORT WAS PREPARED BY CAPT DUANE R NEEDELS, BASE
NAVIGATOR, TITLE AB GREENLAND. IN MY OPINION THE SIGHTING WAS
PROBABLY A SATELLITE EVEN THOUGH SWWS GAVE A NEGATIVE REPORT.
PAGE 5 READER D 125 UNCLAS
THIS OPINION COMES FROM THE PILOTS DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT
AND FROM MY PERSONALLY OBSERVING A SATELLITE ON A PREVIOUS
OCCASION. I DID NOT PERSONALLY INTERVIEW THE PILOT. THAT WAS
ACCOMPLISHED BY MAJOR STEPHENS, ASSIGNED TO THE DEW LINE SITE
AT BALL BEACH. MAJOR STEPHENS HELD A 15 MINUTE INTERVIEW WITH
THE PILOT AFTER HE LANDED AT BALL BEACH. MOST OF THE INFORMATION
CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT CAME TO ME FROM MAJOR STEPHENS VIA A
PHONE CALL.
L. NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.
