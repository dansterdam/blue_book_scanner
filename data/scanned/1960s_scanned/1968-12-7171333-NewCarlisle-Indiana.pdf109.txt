"You want to know about the sighting. Okay, let me tell you what I saw. I was out in my backyard, just standing around, when I happened to look up and saw two strange objects in the sky. They were flying very fast, much faster than any airplane I've ever seen. At first, I thought they might be jets, but they weren't making any noise at all. They seemed to be completely silent.

The objects were sort of oval-shaped, with a metallic appearance. They were flying very close together, only about 50 feet apart. As I watched, they began to slow down and then suddenly made a very tight turn, almost like they were doing a U-turn in the sky. After that, they accelerated again and shot off at an incredible speed, disappearing from sight in just a few seconds.

I was really amazed by what I had seen. It was unlike anything I had ever witnessed before. I know what I saw was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. These objects were truly unidentified flying objects. I'm not sure what they were or where they came from, but I can tell you that it was a very strange and incredible sight.

Remember, I saw it with my own eyes and I know what I saw. I hope this helps you understand what happened. Let me know if you have any other questions."
