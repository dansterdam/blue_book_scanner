There is no photograph present in this scanned document from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be a typed report from the Department of the Air Force regarding a UFO sighting.

BDO-I
U.P.O.
Air Force Systems Command (FTDC) 
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. Attached is a U.F.O. report of very doubtful validity. It is apparently transmitted to your office for your records and is also to be reported to N.I.C.A.P.
2. Some comments which may not care to put on the record itself: This appeared to be a pathetic attempt to gain some publicity by an artist whose career would appear to be understated. The lady appeared to be disturbed and lived alone in a poor one room apartment with very visible and shabby furnishings. We assisted her in having an apparent fear being evicted.
3. She is an apparent fan and follower of N.I.C.A.P. and is being watched by us from outa surveillance standpoint.
c. My NCO, TSgt Saldonio Montiboni, and I feel this was a rather desperate attempt to gain in the U.P.O. of publicity and nothing more.
