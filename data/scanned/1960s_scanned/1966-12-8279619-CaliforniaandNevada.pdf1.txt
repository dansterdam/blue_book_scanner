2. LOCATION: California & Nevada
3. SOURCE: Civilian & Military

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Various observers reported watching a large cloud-like object. The object was yellow to blue in color and looked like a cloud before growing up into an elongated trail. The object looked like two big oblong platters. Sketches by witnesses looked quite similar.
Contact with the ASA at the Tonopah Test Range, Nevada, revealed that there was a missile launch at 22:00 hours, which is consistent with the witness observations of an artificial cloud release.
