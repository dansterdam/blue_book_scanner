UFO Over Western NY
A large, bright object was seen over western New York on July 18, 1963. It was first sighted at 9:30 p.m. as an extremely bright light approaching from the southwest. The object increased in size and much brighter. The UFO then abruptly stopped, then started up again, then slow down and float. Personnel at the Niagara Falls International Airport observed the object but had no radar contact. They felt the UFO was a weather balloon. Thousands of other people saw the object during good weather conditions.
