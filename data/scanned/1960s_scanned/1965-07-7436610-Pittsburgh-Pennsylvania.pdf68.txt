Mrs. D A P
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mrs. P:

This is in response to your request for information on the UFO which you saw on the above date in the Washington, D.C. area. I regret that I was unable to supply this information to you sooner, but I have been in the field in connection with another siting in this area.

The siting you reported, which occurred at approximately 9:15 p.m. on the above date in the Washington, D.C. area, has been investigated and the pertinent details are as follows:

The object was described as a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving in a northerly direction at a moderate rate of speed. The duration of the sighting was approximately 5 minutes. No sound was heard and no other unusual phenomenon was reported.

Investigation has failed to identify this object as any known conventional aircraft or other identifiable source. The Air Force is continuing its investigation of this incident.

I trust this information is helpful. If you have any additional details which you feel may be pertinent, please do not hesitate to provide them.

Sincerely,
