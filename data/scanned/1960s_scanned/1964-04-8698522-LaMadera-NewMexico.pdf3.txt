SOCORRO, N.M. - Dr. J. A. Hynek, Scientific Consultant to Project Blue Book, visited LaMadera, N.M. on April 25, 1964, to investigate a reported UFO sighting.

Mr. Lonnie Zamora, a Socorro policeman, reported that on April 24, 1964, about 5:45 p.m., he was driving south on N.M. Highway 1, just south of the city limits of Socorro, when he saw a shiny object in the sky to the southwest. He first thought it was an overturned car, and when he slowed down to investigate, he saw what appeared to be a car on the ground with two people near it. As he got closer, about 150-200 yards, he saw the object rise off the ground with a tremendous roar and great flame, and disappear over the horizon. The object was described as being about the size of a car, oval in shape, and white in color. Mr. Zamora said the object was very shiny, and made a sound like a roar, not a blast. The object had a red insignia on the side. During the investigation, Dr. Hynek was able to corroborate many of the details in Mr. Zamora's report. Mr. Zamora is described as a reliable and stable person, and his report is considered credible.
