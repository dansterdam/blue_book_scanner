The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed memo for record. The memo describes a UFO observation that occurred on 3 March 1968 between 9:45 pm and 10:00 pm. The memo states that several objects (at least 6) were observed in the sky in the NE area, and that they would definitively have crossed a N-S line south of the airport. The duration of the observation was one minute and thirty seconds. The observer was at an elevation of 20-25 degrees above the horizon (about 5 degs above the moon) and the visibility was clear. The observer only saw the object for thirty seconds because he had to issue a clearance, and when he looked at it again, it had disappeared, so he turned to do something else since the object was passing out of sight due to the distance.
