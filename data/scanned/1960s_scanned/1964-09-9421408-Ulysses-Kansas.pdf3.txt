CAME AT THE APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET OFF THE GROUND ABOUT 40 FEET FROM ME. THERE WAS A BUBBLE ON TOP BUT IT WAS THE SAME COLOR AS THE REST OF THE CRAFT. WHEN THE OBJECT BANKED TO GO ABOVE ME I COULD SEE A SMALL OPENING TO THE BOTTOM THAT SEEMED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE GROUND. THERE WERE NO VISIBLE MOVING PARTS TO THE OBJECT BUT GAVE THE APPEARANCE OF WORKING BY MAGNETIC FORCE. IT SIMPLY BANKED AND CHANGED DIRECTION.
