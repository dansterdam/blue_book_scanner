31. 10 July 1967, Anazee, Mississippi. See attached supplemental sheet 3.
32. 11 July 1967, Macon, Georgia. Temporarily misplaced. Check to see whether this has any relation to the sighting the previous day in Anazee, Mississippi.
33. 25 July 1967, Manchester, New Hampshire. The only Manchester, New Hampshire is for a different date.
34. 6 October 1967, Osceola County, Florida. Although this had four witnesses, the data are very poor. A photograph was taken, but it is very poor. There was one trailing the other, nighttime observation, went from the northern to the southern horizon in three minutes. Anyone of three evaluations: (1) insufficient data (2) probable aircraft (3) possible unknown.
35. 31 October 1967, Denver, Colorado. Do not have in my files. Will do in Dayton.
