The image does not contain any photographs. However, it appears to be an internal correspondence document from Project Blue Book, dated 23 September 1965, discussing the analysis of "streaks and spots" in some film.

INTERNAL CORRESPONDENCE
DATE 23 September 1965
TO: Lt. Alexander
FILE: 572A, ROOM 110
FROM: MND 969
SUBJECT: STREAKS AND SPOTS ON PHOTOGRAPH
Several slides with streaks and spots were submitted for opinion. The writer reviewed the material and concluded the streaks are a result of exposure rather than the presence of any substantive phenomena. All these spots on slide 6 originate from the photographic particles - the normal grain and defects of the film itself. No unusual objects or images could be detected. The slide at index 7 shows a developing effect of the film which is normal. The streaks are from a variety of causes. The majority are from a technical malfunction of the camera. They appear to be the result of film transportation problems during exposure. The spots on slides 1, 3, and 4 are likely the result of imperfect slides. The spots on slides 1 and 8 can probably be accounted for by minute dust particles on the slide surface or film.
