The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page of text from what seems to be a Project Blue Book UFO report document. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the output of all the text found in the document:

Meeting on 8-27-66
witnesses:
Mrs. Audrey and 12 year old daughter
Duration: 6:30 pm to 7:15 pm
Location: Hancock, Minnesota
Object was sitting on the ground and seemed to be a saucer-shaped craft. 
It had lights on it of different colors.
It was about 30 feet in diameter.
The object was silent and did not move.
The object lifted off the ground after 15-20 minutes and it went up fast.
The object was seen by two other people who reported it as a "bright object".
They think it may have been a military craft.
