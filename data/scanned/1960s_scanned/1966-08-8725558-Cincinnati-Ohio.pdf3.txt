There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. 

The text in the document reads:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   5 Aug 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points on this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
