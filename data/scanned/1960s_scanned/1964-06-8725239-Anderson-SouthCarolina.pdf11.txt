Project Blue Book: Int. Officer
The Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 

Dear Sir:

In reference to my letter concerning a UFO sighting by a Mr. Learned Barham of Hallandale, South Florida and investigation of his sighting on the night of 28 June 1964.

I have heard from Mr. J.A. Long, Administrative Assistant of the Air Force Reserve in Atlanta, regarding his conversations with the investigators of Anderson Field, S.C. NOT TO BE RADIOACTIVE.

Today I received a signed letter from Mr. Farham in which he states you were given false information by the U.S.A.F. man who is in conversation with him. Mr. Farham states they did not receive three (3) witnesses to the original readings on his car and THEY WERE RADIOACTIVE.I do not believe the investigation has been thorough enough to warrant the conclusion of "Not To Be Radioactive" and I ask most serious that this investigation be gone into more carefully.

The three witnesses Mr. Farham has are (3) reporters and they would be hard to find by F.A.A. officials to the Government Investigators. I don't consider this case closed and would like your document and further evaluation of same as soon as possible.

Mr. Farham can be contacted for further information or I can send you a photo-copy of his signed letter.

Please indicate it you can continue this investigation and what action, if any, I am to take.

Sincerely yours,
