Sept. 12, 1968

Dear Hector: 

Refer to your letter to receive the Cuming County, Nebraska, report of July 29, 1968. I'm sorry I cannot give you any more information from this report. 

I'm sure that you have developed a sort of 'case history' on the obvious hoaxes and in comparing the descriptives you should reports, while I doubt that I can add anything of value to these reports, I would like to make a few comments on the instant case. 

First, I written to Rogers for a few more details, including a sketch of the scene. 

I'm also sure that you have developed a sort of 'case history' on the obvious hoaxes and in comparing the descriptives you should reports, while I doubt that I can add anything of value to these reports, I would like to make a few comments on the instant case. 

Now, since Rogers does not seem to have "seen" it (the object, I presume), this case is necessarily based on testimonial accounts only. The witness, Mr. Woodyard, does not claim to have seen the object either. All he heard, according to the report, was a roaring noise and saw a bright light in the sky (which, of course, does not prove that the noise and the light were connected). 

I'm afraid that, since I did not have the opportunity to see the case in more detail, I cannot make any intelligent comments that would be of value to you. I did not find anything in the report that would lead me to believe that a real UFO was involved. The report, as you can see, is rather sketchy.

Yours sincerely,
