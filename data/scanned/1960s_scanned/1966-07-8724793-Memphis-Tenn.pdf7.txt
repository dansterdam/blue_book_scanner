The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to show a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The document is typed and appears to be a letter discussing a sighting of a craft, with the writer stating that it was not an airplane and that they have made shots of the craft. The writer requests any other sightings or information related to this incident.

Please be advised that immediately after this craft left our sight, it proceeded to make a vertical ascent and was very able to make a sudden departure to such an altitude, and was NOT an airplane of any type known to us. I have made shots which I would be pleased to forward some to you.

In view of the above description, I would appreciate hearing from you as to whether or not this sighting is considered valid. Also, please advise if any other sightings of this nature have been reported to your office.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Sincerely,
