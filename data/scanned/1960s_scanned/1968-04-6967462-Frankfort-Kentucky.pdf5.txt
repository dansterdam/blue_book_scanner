APRIL 13, 1968

DEAR SIR:

MY NEPHEW AND I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD SENT THIS REGARDING TO YOU AND ALSO TO SEE IF SOMEONE CAN ASSIST IN SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED.

ON APRIL 13, 1968, ABOUT 9:15 P.M., I SAW WHAT I BELIEVE WAS A CRAFT ABOUT 200 FEET IN DIAMETER HOVERING OVER OUR CAR AND MY NEPHEW AND I ALSO SAW IT.

IT WAS A VERY LARGE AND ROUND UFO AND I SHOOK AND WAS VERY APPREHENSIVE AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AND WAS HOPING IT WOULD NOT COME CLOSER AND ABDUCT US. 

AFTER A FEW MINUTES, IT SLOWLY BEGAN TO ASCEND AND THEN WE COULD DISCERN 3 ROWS OF BRIGHT LIGHTS AROUND THE CRAFT. 

WHEN IT WAS LEAVING, IT ACCELERATED RAPIDLY AND SOON BECAME A SMALL BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE. 

AND WENT TO POOL ON APRIL 13, 1968 AND MY NEPHEW TOLD THE SAME SOUND HIS FATHER HEARD (HIS FATHER WAS SOME 2 MILES AWAY AND HAD ALSO OBSERVED THE UFO).

HESBAND WAS FRIGHTENED AND HIS SON WAS EQUALLY SO (OUR WHICH GOES WERE PARKED PARKING AND SEEMED TO BE VERY FRIGHTENED).

AT THE SCENE, AND BOTH WERE QUITE SHAKEN AND FELT THAT THE WHOLE THING WAS VERY FRIGHTENING.

I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD FORWARD THIS TO APPROPRIATE SOURCES AND TO DETERMINE IF SOMEONE CAN SHED SOME LIGHT AND GIVE US INFORMATION REGARDING THIS INCIDENT.

SINCERELY,

[SIGNATURE]
