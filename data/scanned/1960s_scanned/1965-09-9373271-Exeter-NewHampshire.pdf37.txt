RECENT SAUCER SIGHTING 
In the early evening of September 3, 1965, while on routine patrol in the Exeter, New Hampshire area, Patrolman Eugene Bertrand and Patrolman Gordon MacDonald of the Exeter Police Department observed a large, brightly lit object in the sky near the Exeter-Hampton line. The object appeared to be metallic in nature, approximately 40 feet in diameter, and was emitting a brilliant white light from its underside. The object was observed to hover motionless for a period of time, then accelerate at a high rate of speed, make an abrupt change in direction, and finally disappear from sight.
