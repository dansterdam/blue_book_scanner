There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text extracted from the document:

Dear Mr. Hunt:

This is in reply to your request for information on a serial object which you observed on 2 August 1955. 

The object which you described appears to be similar to the one described in the report on file which was forwarded to you on 19 August 1955. However, the information contained in your report does not add substantially to the data already in our files. It is requested that you complete the enclosed form and return it to this office. This is to assist us in adding any additional information to our files.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING
