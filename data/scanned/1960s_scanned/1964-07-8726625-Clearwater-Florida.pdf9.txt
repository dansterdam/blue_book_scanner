July 7, 1964

Captain F. W. Ryan
Dept of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Captain Ryan:

This is a report on a UFO sighting by my wife and myself on the evening of July 6, 1964 at 10:15 PM.

We first noticed the object in the sky about 10:15 PM. It was moving in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed, much faster than any conventional aircraft. It seemed to be a bright, shiny, metallic object, oval in shape. It made no sound that we could hear. The object stopped momentarily in mid-air, then proceeded on its way again at a high rate of speed. We watched it for about 30 seconds before it disappeared from sight.

I am a commercial pilot and my wife and I have seen many aircraft of all types but this was definitely not an aircraft of any kind that we have ever seen before.

Sincerely,
(Signature)
