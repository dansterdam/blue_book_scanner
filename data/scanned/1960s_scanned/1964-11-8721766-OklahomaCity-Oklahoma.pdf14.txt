OKLAHOMA CITY'S RARE VISITOR FROM SPACE

Little did Rick Rume realize that before the occurrence seldom seen in such case, The main object, a search of the
literature revealed nothing alike, was merely a small blackened, triangular-shaped hunk of rock, which over 200 small fragments had broken off during its fiery descent. Preliminary analysis of the 21 pound object indicated this was basically a ferrous meteorite, the administration lab at Houston, Texas, the result of a very preliminary and cursory examination of the sample. The specimen appears to be a meteorite, the spectacular display and pyrotechnics seen by many were caused by an unusual object from outer space striking the atmosphere at high speed and partially burning up. It was merely another visitor to our planet to be added to the many which have visited here periodically since the dawn of time and will continue to do so.
Bona fide investigators have pointed out that the so-called Unidentified Flying Objects, reported by many in recent years, may well be nothing more than natural phenomena in the skies, such as meteor showers, ice formations, and mirages. There have been some cases, however, where some substance, usually in the form of unusual metal or mineral, has been recovered after the observation of such celestial visitors. In the present case there is solid evidence in the form of the rock fragment recovered.
