The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. 

Acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 3 Day 5 Month 1965 Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

1) Military types of things which have been photographed before. This is not something new, but an occurrence of these phenomena.
2) Daytime observation - I know it was not planes, as the object hovered, moved swiftly, and maneuvered in a manner not consistent with the behavior of aircraft.
3) angle - I know it was not meteors, as the elevation angle remained fairly constant for long periods of time.
4) the change direction so rapidly and unexpectedly without sound was most astounding. 
5) Numerous objects and similar activity observed on prior occasions.

If my statement 1 above is deemed significant (as I sense the same original skepticism), I would be pleased to have a meeting with your representatives to clarify my observations, which in no way can be considered an "imaginary" or "fantastic" sighting. My observations were precise and factual, and my report is made in good faith. I realize there are many facets of the UFO subject which may not be acceptable or credible to your organization, but I am confident that your thorough investigation of this case will reveal the factual nature of these observations.
