The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing a UFO sighting.

It was not the moon, Mr. ___ continued, because the moon was in a different position about that time. The object was about the shape of an elongated sphere, it was much larger than the size of a star.
Mr. ___ was contacted and his account of the sighting was essentially as follows:
a. He estimated the angle of elevation to be about 50° to 55°.
b. The object was in view for an estimated 3 to 4 minute period of time as an estimated 30° to 35° in azimuth about 25° to 30° in altitude.
c. He thought the light had gone out behind a cloud or thick haze.
