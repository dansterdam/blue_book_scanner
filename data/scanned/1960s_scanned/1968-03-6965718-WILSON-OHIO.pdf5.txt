MEMO FOR THE RECORD 
Subj: UFO Report, 19 March 1963 
At 0745, 11 March 1963, Major Heaton .Quintanilla, Jr spoke with the County Sheriff at Belleville, Ohio (614, 445-1631) with regards to the UFO observation of 10 11 by Sheriff and one of their officers had gone over there and the Civil Defense Director over to the area that night took geiger counters and couldn't find anything at all. The Sheriff said "We were thinking that the boy had burned his jacket and just smoking it." The Sheriff said that in this town the kids are fascinated by UFO's. About 50-60 believe sightings and about 50% don't. The Sheriff said they have what's left of the Jacket. The Sheriff did not speak with Phillips, however, as he thought that the newspapers had talked to him. He don't think he would have released the boy if he thought there was nothing to it. The boy said the object hovered over him and an arm dropped off of it. The Sheriff said there was a group going around school that purm his Jacket smoking. Underneath the Jacket there was a sweatshirt only had very few burns on it. The Jacket doesn't smell from gas or anything like that. The Sheriff said "I have been Sheriff since 1949 and I know if I had 10 minutes I could find out what's going on think it will be out," I've got some young kids feeling his out .." It is so bad in some of the area, that people live thinking about nothing but UFO's. It's just the rural area and they are always on the look for UFOs. They have fun and laugh about it all the time but they still believe it. The Sheriff informed Major Quintanilla that they would be having a break on the case, probably in a day or so and would call him then. 
asked Major Quintanilla if he got anything new, would he please call.
