In re: Missile over Kentucky

What has been written here about a flying missile need not be discounted. In any way, what has been described is likely based on outdoor observation, having spent time in the aggregate half a dozen years of my life on many night-time and occasional daylight investigations of military and civil aircraft. I am highly trained in outdoor observations, and I do know to look sharp for his safety - you can appreciate the need for careful observation in long range celestial activities.

If Cape Kennedy cannot account for the missile, then I suggest most earnest consideration of which from Cuba.

Sincerely,

P.S: A check with a compass shows that I was looking almost due northeast, actually on a 360 sight, when the missile passed by from my right to my left.
