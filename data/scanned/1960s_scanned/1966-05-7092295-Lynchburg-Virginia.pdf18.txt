Dear Major Quintanilla,

I am a fifth grader. I am to give a report on the UFOs. Could you tell me where some of the UFOs were sited in Ohio and Michigan?

Also a girl in my class said she saw something in the sky one evening. All she saw were three red lights standing still. First one would blink, about 2 or 3 minutes later the next one would blink and so on. She said they were about 15 minutes it started to move it slowly then vanished. Could you give me your opinion on this object?

Thank you very much.

Sincerely yours,
