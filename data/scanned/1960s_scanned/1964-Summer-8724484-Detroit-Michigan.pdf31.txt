There is no photograph visible in this image. It appears to be the contents of an old project blue book UFO report document, specifically a letter dated August 13, 1964.

The text in the document is as follows:

August 13, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in response to your recent letter concerning unidentified flying objects.

Enclosed with the photograph taken on [redacted] showing what appears to be a white oval-shaped object, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, hovering approximately 30 feet above the ground. This was sighted by [redacted] who stated the object hovered for several minutes and then accelerated at a rapid rate of speed out of sight.

Included is a summary of information on Project Blue Book, the official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects. We believe this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

MAJOR M. JACKS
Chief, Data Reduction Division
