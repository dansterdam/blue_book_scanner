Total time about one half hour.
Narrative:
Observed circular objects in the sky from east second street neighborhood. Watched sky is approximate fifteen minute, but could see about a lot of stars in the sky. Did observe some haze or mist in the sky but this seemed unusual This caused the object to appear more bright and distinct. The object seemed to fly with no disappearance to the east. It moved about proportion to the opinion that it was a military aircraft.

Note: Officer was not interested enough or did not want to be seen so he just complained and left. Described it similar to seeing a light by the time he arrived. Also told the officer that he was of the opinion that it was a light near the city. Also told his wife the officer but later. Got it was an airplane. I first the police had said it was a satellite.
I would call this fellow is very poor observer.
