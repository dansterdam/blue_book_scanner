Catholic Holy Sacred Heart School, was contacted at her quarters on the 10th of March at 2100 hours. An interview was conducted and the following statement was given:

Around 1330 to 1345, possibly at 1335, I had a brief sighting of an object. This sighting lasted about 5 seconds. It was near 60 degrees, high and appeared in the west. It could have been over the Illinois river. No sound was emitted. The object appeared as a silver-like disc and was descending very slowly. I saw vapor trails of the jets. One appeared to be going east and the other two going west. I would say the object was at the same altitude as the jets.
