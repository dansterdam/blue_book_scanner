UAO Photographed Clearly
In Australia

An abject described as a bright orange
glow with a "dent" on top and a "knot"
on the bottom, has been photographed
in Australia. This "unidentified aerial
object" was also an amateur photographer. 

Mr Walter Denzau, steward on the
freighter Iron Duke, said he saw the ob-
ject soon after 10 pm on March 17, 1968,
when he began to photograph a moon-
diated effect while at sea on the way to
Newcastle.

Astronomical experts in Adelaide have
been unable to identify the object, yet
Professor J. H. Carver, Professor of
Physics at Adelaide University and pa-
tron of the Astronomical Society of South
Australia, said on 4 April that the de-
tailed behavior of the object was con-
sistent with that of an aircraft, equipp-
ed with a very strong light.

An RAAF spokesman said that to his
knowledge there had been no planes
using powerful searchlights in the area at
that time. Otherwise the object could only have been a satel-
lite orbiting the earth and illuminated
by the moon.

There was no information in the Mel-
bourne Herald about the exact geograph-
ical location of the freighter. Neither did
the articles state whether the movies were black and white or in
color or still or moving pictures, although
the articles seem to indicate the photos
are color motion films.
