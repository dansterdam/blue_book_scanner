The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report related to a Project Blue Book UFO investigation.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The reasons we were afraid to call people calling themselves may be strange people and we are still not sure what to think about it.

It now appears rather serious and we will stick to our story.
In a way it was fast-acting and we watched it very curiously but did not know what to think.
Please do not mention this to anyone still feel that this really happened to us.
It came hovering over the trees and seemed as well.
We are only local people and this is not a false report, because the others say they have not any doubt there was something seen that night, but they could not point it out.
This is not something we made up or felt as nice or die because they may have felt as nice did not feel as nice as die."

The text appears to be a handwritten account or report related to a UFO sighting, describing the witnesses' reaction and their hesitation to report it publicly.
