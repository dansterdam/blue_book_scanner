30 Oct. 1966
Southampton, New York

I was alerted by my sister-in-law. There is something she says that might be interesting to take a picture. I walked out, about supper time, 6:20, in my shirt sleeves. Spotted object north along power line. Traveling north to south, then south west. UFO had arms that sparkled like arc-light, which seemed to be in front of, lighting up an area ahead of it. Heard slight hum, xxxxxxx like electric turbine. Was in sight for at least seven minutes. Guess to be at 1500 or 2,000 feet. Enormous size, over 100" wide. Following power line south to ocean, then turned southwest along Rt 27 to hover over college. Lost sight of it over college.

Type film: 35 mm
Green trail width (4+2) = 7 mm
If 90 mm dog, 22 mm = 6 width at 13 day/men, 1:50 ef = 6 mm
22 x 2.0359 = frame width
234 + 0.0359 = 234.0359 film width
35 mm frame = 15 frame
(0.0354 x 5.2) = 1.3 min
