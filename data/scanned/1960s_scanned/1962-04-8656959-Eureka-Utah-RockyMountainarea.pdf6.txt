Text from the document:

On April 13, 1962 the Air Force Detense Command was puzzled by an unidentified aerial phenomenon observed over the Rocky Mountain area. The unique distinction was being tracked by radar 90 miles southwest of Eureka, Utah. The object was observed for a period of over 30 minutes and was tracked and traced over a wide area. The Air Defense Command alert reported the object was tracked and traced over a wide area, but verification could not be made since command and control facilities were not available in the tactical area at that time. The object was tracked by radar to be as much as 40,000 feet in the Pacific hundreds of miles high.
