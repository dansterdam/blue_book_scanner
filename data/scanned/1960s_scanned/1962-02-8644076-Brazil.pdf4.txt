He's an ex Navy fly boy, altitude of object approximately 40 foot, 15 ft in length and diameter, no means of propulsion. Just curious about object, aqua, grayish color, sausage shape, approximately observed in February 1962 in Los Angeles area, no other witnesses other than he and his friend
phone, Los Angeles, California.  He asked Sgt Jones (Mr 
called Sgt Jones his pal) if they had anything then. Sgt Jones mentioned some reports that there were nighthings in the LA area, asked Jones if he ever got a report like this. Jones said that we have had objects of the same color nature reported, sometimes they were aircraft and others could be something else, but this couldn't say what it was without more of a description. He said that well pal, you just said it was an aircraft,  said that it couldn't be an aircraft, quite convinced that there was something there. Stunt on both ends like a sausage. expected an analysis over the telephone. Jones asked if we could send a form for him and his friend to fill out as he was only on the administrative end of typing and filing and that he couldn't tell him what it was because the evaluator was not in the office today.  
NOTE:  admitted that he had been drinking, he also sounded intoxicated.
