The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch shows a compass rose with various compass directions labeled. The smaller sketches on the bottom show two views of a landscape, one of a person standing on a road with hills or mountains in the background, and another view looking off into the distance at a landscape with hills or mountains.

Text output from the document:

6A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED, IF IT DID MOVE. 

2. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN, CONNECT THE "X" AND "+" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. THIS WILL ENABLE US TO DETERMINE ITS SPEED AND DIRECTION OF TRAVEL. ALSO, SHOW BY AN ARROW IF THE PHENOMENON INCREASED OR DECREASED IN SIZE DURING THE OBSERVATION.
