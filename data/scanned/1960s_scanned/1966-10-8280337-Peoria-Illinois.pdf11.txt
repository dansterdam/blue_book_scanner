Gentlemen:

Two weeks ago on October 11 between 7:15 and 7:30 p.m. I saw a moving light (at what seemed to be a height just above the tree tops) pass over my house. The light was elongated (perhaps three feet in length and a few inches thick -- from my position on the ground), brilliant yellow in color, and moved very fast. I saw this for only a brief moment as it passed. There was no noise. Even though it was just a momentary event, I have no doubt that I saw this dark sky and saw the "thing" moving as swiftly.

I am writing to you because I just read an article entitled "UFOS TO BE PROBED IN THE OCTOBER 22 ISSUE OF LIFE". You asked in the article that such events be reported.

Sincerely,
