34. Date you completed this questionnaire: July 12, 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: When the object appeared over the field and headed down our direction, I thought it was coming our direction & would land in the field. The pulled up sharply as if flipping over & went out, was permanently fixed light on a field pole - we decided to drive closer
We were impressed with the intensity of the light and more the way it flipped over sharply and went out, suddenly veering off, than the fact that it was present. Its sudden veering to the right and quick disappearance, the fact that the bright light that came up and down seemed to be a permanent field light on a pole that the object had passed, and that it had flipped over sharply rather than just flying off, all impressed us greatly.
