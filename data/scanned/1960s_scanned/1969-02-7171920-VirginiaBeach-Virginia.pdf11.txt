Dear Sir:

Tonight at about 7:02 or 7:03 I would like to know if you picked up anything strings on your radar. If you did or didn't, I would like to report a dime-shaped flight that was seen. When I first saw it I thought it was a plane on fire because at the front of it there was a bright light. Than the evening after I saw it when I noticed a jet flying much higher, the thing seemed to move toward the jet and then veer away from the jet. It was moving from west to east at about 300 m.p.h. It had a light on each end that I first mentioned and a bright light in the center.  

I would like to have an answer from you as soon as possible. There is a drawing of what I saw along with this letter. Please answer as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
Wade Bell
