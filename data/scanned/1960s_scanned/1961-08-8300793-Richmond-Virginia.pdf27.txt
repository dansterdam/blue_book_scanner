EVANSTON, ILLINOIS - 30 AUG 61 Frederick Aguilard was also notched the sighting while flying a Cessna 150' and 5713' CSOE altitude. He stated the object appeared to be about half the brightness of Echo moving on a parallel course to the satellite's left, at a distance equal to three diameters of the satellite. It was going the same direction as Echo at the same case in undergoing further study. A follow-up may be expected.
