The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, possibly an old UFO report.

Here is the text from the document:

They were extremely small and they were getting very fast, the night manuele they were going at a very fast rate of speed an all sudden went up to a tremendous altitude and darted back and forth and there must of been hundreds of them all moving at the same time, they were moving at a tremendous rate of speed and they were all blinking on and off and they were all different colors, blue, white, purple and red and they were all moving in different directions and together with great speed. I told my wife at the time I don't believe I have ever seen anything like that before they came back and they were going very slow and then they left one at a time and went up to a great speed and were gone. In others words, their performance was unbelievable, but it did not last only about five to ten minutes. I would not make a statement or do not know exactly what they were, but I do know this, they were not airplanes, they were not helicopters, they were not birds, they were something I have never seen before, and I have lived on this farm all my life. I do not know what they were but I know they were not anything I have ever seen before.
