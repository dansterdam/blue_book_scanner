To Whom It May Concern:

I am requesting all available data, including personal interviews, and photographs where possible, on sightings of or encounters with Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) or "flying saucers"). I would also appreciate three (3) copies each of the "United States Air Force Technical Information Sheet" on any sightings, and any other questions in reference to flying objects.

In the past two decades the United States' investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects has included numerous names, such as Project Bluebook, Project Sign, Project Twinkle, and one other that I am not at present certain of what is it. I would appreciate what information your committee and the name and address of the commanding officer.

The information requested is for my personal file and not to be knowledge be published.

Trusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience.
Very truly yours,
