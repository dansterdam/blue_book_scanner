This incident was reported to have occurred sometime during the evening of June 29, 1961. Three witnesses, two men and one woman, reported seeing an unusual object in the sky over Hardinsburg, Kentucky. 

The object was described as being round in shape, with a bright glow and numerous bright, steady lights around its perimeter. It was reported to have been hovering and maneuvering in the sky for approximately 30 to 45 minutes before moving off to the northwest at a high rate of speed. 

The witnesses indicated that the object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000 to 2,000 feet and was silent in operation. No sound was reported to have been associated with the object. 

The report was received by the U.S. Air Force on July 5, 1961 and was investigated by officials from Project Blue Book. The investigation concluded that the object observed was most likely a high-altitude balloon, based on the characteristics described by the witnesses.
