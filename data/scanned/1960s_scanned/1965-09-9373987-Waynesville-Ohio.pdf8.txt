The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

On this page night, we saw an object so striking across the sky. It was first greed and shide but turned red and blue and we are not sure what the colors, but instead all we saw was a bright light and it only lasted just a second.

As for the data described or writing this letter, I would like very much to know more about what you might have to offer.

If you would give me some source that I might check into.

I would like to thank you very much for reading this letter, I feel the Air Force is making a great mistake by not telling the public a little more about these cases. As you can readily see, they certainly have news value and I think more people would take an active interest if they knew more facts.

Thank you.

Respectfully,

Waynesville, Ohio
