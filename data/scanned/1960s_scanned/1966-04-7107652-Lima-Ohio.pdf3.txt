Dear Sir:
I am writing this letter on behalf of my wife to request a "report form" to be filled out by those having seen what they believe to have been an unidentified flying object.
On the night of April 21st my wife while in our back yard on the West side of Lima and others in this area saw bright, fast moving objects traveling from West to Southwest, perhaps your report form will help us to give a more comprehensive report. We are certain it was no kind of aircraft we have ever heard of, nor was it a meteor or fireball like anything we have ever seen.
Because of the frequency of such sightings we feel that this sighting should be added to your present information and may be of assistance in coming to a conclusion as to the nature of this most unusual phenomenon.
Most sincerely yours,
[signature redacted]
