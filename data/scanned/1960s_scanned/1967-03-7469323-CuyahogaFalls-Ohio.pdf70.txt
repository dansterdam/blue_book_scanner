Proposed reply to letter from AUG 2, 67 (34.8T)

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your recent letter in which you reported your observations of May 10, 1967. With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data such as size, speed, altitude, color, maneuvers, etc. are quite important in a complete evaluation. If you had reported your observation to your nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your nearest military installation is:

910 Troop Carrier Group
Youngstown Municipal Airport
Vienna, Ohio 44473
Phone: area code 216; 372-3551 ext 2

The information on your unidentified observations will be added to our present data base.

The enclosed information on Project Blue Book may be of interest to you. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
