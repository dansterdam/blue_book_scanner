There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this scanned document page. The image shows a blank white area with a text box at the top that reads "ANY INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS ADDITIONAL AND WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE INCIDENT."

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

ANY INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS ADDITIONAL AND WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE INCIDENT.
