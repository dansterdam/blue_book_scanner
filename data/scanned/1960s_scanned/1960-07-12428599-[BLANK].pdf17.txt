There is no photograph in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that contains text describing various aspects of the project, including:

- A briefing that took place on 15 July 1960, where the investigative capabilities of the Air Force were discussed.
- During this briefing, it was stated that the investigative capabilities were limited, and that more people and funds were needed to permit a thorough investigation.
- The resources available to ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) for carrying out investigations, including the Aerial Phenomena Group, scientific and technical capabilities, and access to various data sources.
- The proposal to satisfy the requirements outlined by Mr. Smart, which would involve providing additional resources and capabilities.
