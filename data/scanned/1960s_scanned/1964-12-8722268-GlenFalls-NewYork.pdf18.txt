LOCAL SIGHTINGS

The 7.7.1964, 2:55 P.M., Porter Dr, Croghan Falls, NY
Seen by Mr. and Mrs. William Marcy who reported the following to the State Police: They were driving east on Porter Dr at a point about 200 yards south of the intersection of Porter Dr and Rt. 9. As they approached an area and descended slightly down the street, they noticed a round object about a foot or more in diameter hovering about 25 feet above the ground and perhaps 20-30 feet away. It was solid white with no visible lights or markings. It appeared to have a metallic sheen. It was apparently stationary as they watched it for about 20 seconds until it suddenly vanished. They stated it was very quiet and disappeared in an instant.

A uniformed member of the landing lights were lost seen at airports where this phenomenon is observed. That this event was a landing as described in State investigation procedure is doubtful because of the speed and sudden vanishing of the object."
