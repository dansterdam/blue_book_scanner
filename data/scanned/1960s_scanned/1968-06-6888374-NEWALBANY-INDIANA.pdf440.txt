The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page contains text and diagrams, including a diagram of what looks like a station icon and a section titled "FIRST CLASS MAIL" with the address of the Department of the Air Force Headquarters Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.
