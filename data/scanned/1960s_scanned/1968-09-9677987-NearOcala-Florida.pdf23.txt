Transcript for UFO sighting: telephone conversation between Hynek and Capt. Hainbault:

This is Allen Hynek at Northwestern University and I'm also the consultant to Project Bluebook, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, on unidentified flying objects. Some time ago, about a week ago, Colonel Quintanilla asked me to look further into the case from Florida which occurred on 15 September 1968.

This is the one that was done in the Palm Beach area, northwest of there?

Yes, that's the one. I've been trying to get in touch with the pilots so far I've gotten no answer and, of course, the copilot. Since you've talked with them, and since Colonel Quintanilla has asked me to look into this further (it's an odd-ball case certainly; there's enough of these reports, though, so that I, at least, am taking them seriously without being a believer in little green men) I wondered in your discussions with these two men what your basic impression was of their reliability and what your own feelings on this case are.

Well, both of these gentlemen are in the ministry; they're evangelistic type individuals--

That's what's meant by the term 'missionary pilots', then. I didn't know what that really meant.

This is why they weren't available for discussion the following day. They had to get out to a couple of the islands and see some of their parishes out there, apparently. I talked to them for ten minutes, at least.
