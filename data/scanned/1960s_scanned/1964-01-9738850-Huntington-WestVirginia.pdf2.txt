Dear Mr. _________,

The observations you made in January 1964 about reports of satellites received by the Air Force are similar to schedules are not retained beyond one year, making identification of a specific satellite impossible at this location.

We are investigating a breakdown in the Air Force program on unidentified flying objects. Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

MAJOR HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.
Chief, Project Blue Book
