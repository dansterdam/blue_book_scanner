Dear Dr.

I was in the process of making the night rounds of installations when I looked up and was greatly surprised to see an illuminated, elongated object in the sky over the southwestern horizon. This object was elongated and appeared to be partially obscured by clouds. It had a pale white glow and emitted no beams or visible light sources. The object was moving silently across the sky in a straight line at a high rate of speed. After observing it for several seconds, it suddenly disappeared behind the horizon.
