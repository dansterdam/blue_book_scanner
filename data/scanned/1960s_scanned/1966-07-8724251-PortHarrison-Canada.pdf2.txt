TDSTS/MAJ H QUINTANILLA, JR/70916/mns
Unidentified Observation, 21 July 1966

U.S. Department of Commerce
Environmental Science Services Administration
Attn: MR. QUINTANILLA

Reference your letter W1321, dated 26 August 1966, regarding an observation by the Canadian Meteorological Service. We have con-
sidered with appreciation the details provided by the Canadian Service, but have been unable to locate the specific balloon which caused the sighting.

Contact was made with the National Center for Atmospheric Research
for any information on a balloon launch on 21 July 1966. No evidence could be found that any balloon was launched that could be re-
lated to this observation. Contact was also made with other departments that launch balloons, and in all instances we met with negative re-
sults.

Since no national threat is indicated and no scientific benefit can be gained we feel justified in closing our file on this observation. However, computer time to retrieve this data would not be justified.

Deputy for Technology and Subsystems
