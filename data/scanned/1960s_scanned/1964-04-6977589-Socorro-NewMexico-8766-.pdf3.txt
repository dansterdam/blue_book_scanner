SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO
8 APRIL 1964

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT

1. AT APPROXIMATELY 5:45 P.M. ON 8 APRIL 1964, PATROLMAN LONNIE ZAMORA, OF THE SOCORRO POLICE DEPARTMENT, WAS ON ROUTINE PATROL ON HIGHWAY 85 ABOUT 5 MILES SOUTH OF SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO.

2. PATROLMAN ZAMORA WAS DRIVING SOUTH ON HIGHWAY 85 WHEN HE HEARD A ROAR AND SAW A FLAME IN THE SKY TO THE SOUTHWEST. HE STOPPED HIS PATROL CAR AND SAW AN OBJECT DESCEND RAPIDLY TO THE GROUND BEHIND A SMALL HILL ABOUT 1/2 MILE SOUTH OF HIS POSITION.

3. ZAMORA PROCEEDED CAUTIOUSLY TO THE AREA WHERE HE THOUGHT THE OBJECT HAD LANDED. AS HE APPROACHED THE AREA, HE SAW A SHINY OBJECT ON THE GROUND. HE DROVE CLOSER AND SAW THAT IT APPEARED TO BE WHITE IN COLOR AND ABOUT 15 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT WAS FURTHER DESCRIBED AS AN EGG-SHAPED OBJECT WITHOUT FINS OR LEGS.

4. ZAMORA ALSO REPORTED OBSERVING TWO SMALL FIGURES, APPARENTLY CLAD IN WHITE COVERALLS, NEAR THE OBJECT. HE STOPPED HIS CAR AT ABOUT 150 YARDS FROM THE OBJECT AND GOT OUT TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER, BUT AS HE APPROACHED, THE OBJECT ROSE STRAIGHT UP WITH A TREMENDOUS ROAR AND FLAME, FRIGHTENING HIM AND CAUSING HIM TO RUN BACK TO HIS CAR.

5. AFTER THE OBJECT TOOK OFF, ZAMORA NOTICED BURNING BUSH VEGETATION AND DEEP IMPRESSIONS IN THE GROUND WHERE THE OBJECT HAD BEEN.

6. ZAMORA REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT HAD RED LETTERING OR MARKINGS ON ITS SIDE WHICH HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE. HE COULD NOT READ THE LETTERING, AND IT WAS GONE BEFORE HE COULD GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE IT CLEARLY.

7. INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF THIS INCIDENT IS CONTINUING.
