1. Yes there were normal traffic indications on our radar scopes. There was also some GCI due to an upcoming exercise noticed in that period.

2. There was normal air traffic in the Waterloo area. No pilots reported anything unusual to the control tower in Waterloo. Traffic was not controlled by Waterloo but Mr. Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) in Aurora, Illinois.
