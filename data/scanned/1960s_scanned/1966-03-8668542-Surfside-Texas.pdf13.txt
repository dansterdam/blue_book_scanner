UFO Sighting Statements

Ref: (a) Comdt (G-CPT) ltr dtd 13 APR 66

1. In accordance with paragraph 2 of reference (a), the following information is submitted:

(a) Moored to USCG dock, USCG Station, Freeport, Texas.

(b) The time of the sighting was at 0135, 20 March 1966. The majority of the crew was on liberty. The CO was onboard on B-2 SAR status. The QM of the watch, who observed the UFO, was standing his watch on the bridge. An off duty COD, MEACHAM, RMT was in the radio shack, adjacent to the bridge, watching the sighting. He alerted the Commanding Officer who was resting.

(c) The vessel was called, but the object had disappeared by that time.

(d) The Commanding Officer was contacted by telephone immediately after the incident occurred. He spoke with the COD and all three observers. They were in a highly excited state and related their observations to him. None of the observers had been drinking.

(e) No pictures or drawings were made of the sighting. It is significant to note that both the sighting in Houston, Texas and in Michigan, as reported to the Commanding Officer before either of the other sightings had been made known to the public through the news media, were experienced by the same or similar type of UFO's. It is the opinion of this command that these men did indeed see some type of flying object of unknown origin whose identity would be purely supposition.
