Upon return to my home near Bethesda, Maryland, plus a resident of the area, I watched the sky. I went in the house a moment, and, when I came out to look again, a red aircraft, resembling an oval-shaped object, had appeared to be hovering or waiting, at 22:00 hrs. It seemed to be approximately 4 or 5 times the size of a standard aircraft, while it made the usual navigational flashing lights. It continued to hover for a few minutes and then suddenly accelerated at an extremely high rate of speed, ascending vertically and disappearing in a matter of seconds, the difference in its speed in comparison to conventional aircraft was greatly pronounced. At 22:15, we were looking north; don't know the exact direction-but taken place. At this time, a "meteor" flamed across the sky view, plunged downward and out of sight. However, I have never seen one so brilliant and large before, and one sighting so very close to one another. As it cannot constant, l respectfully, have never seen one shocking a piece so display of activity, and I cannot remember it since except as an imagined "motion" of a picture, sho
w as of itself, and all pieces, hindered prior to conclude the horizon.
