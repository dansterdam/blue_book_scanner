NATURE OF COMPLAINT
Reports sighting of unidentified flying objects

REPORT:
Complainant called the post and stated that at about 9:50 PM on 5-26-64 while at home on M-99 near the village limits, he saw two unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over the area. He reported that the UFOs were bright silverish in color, going to and fro, and that they seemed to chase each other. He could not see the shape but said they were larger than the two aircraft flying together in this area frequently. The objects maintained a steady altitude and there was no sound. The complainant said the sighting lasted about 20 minutes.
