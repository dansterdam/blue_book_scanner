About 200 mph What can not be north circuit circuit Toronto 14, Ontario

I know this would be difficult to believe as true, but I was actual witness to the flying motion of this craft. It was traveling with great speed and exhibited no visible means of propulsion. As it passed overhead all sound ceased except the muffled hum. I estimate the craft's speed to be about 200 mph. Its color was a dull gray or green and appeared to be metallic in nature. It was less than 200 feet above ground and passed directly over my head. 

Sincerely yours
