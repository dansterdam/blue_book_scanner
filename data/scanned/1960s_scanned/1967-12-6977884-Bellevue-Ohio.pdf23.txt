The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an excerpt from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and extract all the text found in the document:

These three witnesses were each sent an AF Form 117 on 7 June 1966 but none of them completed and returned the form at that time. All three were sent an AF Form 117 again, on 27 March 1968. In question #1, the date of the observation is given as 17 September 1967, to the left of this date is also the date 7 December 1967. Also the witnesses in no way stated that the object "was saucer-shaped, that it had a revolving red light, that lighted all the way around, that the bottom was dome-shaped" as insinuated in Dr Hynek's letter but stated that he saw a light, "a little like an airplane" and that he saw the object a distance of 8 miles as indicated in question #12). Of interest are the fact that no one else in the area reported a similar sighting to us for that night. The police department feel it important enough to answer our letter and also the observer had a copy of the green 1219 reporting form on hand.

6. The duration, flight characteristics, the white light and red light in no way conflict with the evaluation of aircraft craft did not perform any erratic motions impossible to an aircraft in the words of the observer, "It did not go up but straight across out of sight."

7. I do not feel that the sighting represents any threat to the security of the United States; gives any evidence that the object sented any extraterrestrial craft or presents an information of scientific value.
