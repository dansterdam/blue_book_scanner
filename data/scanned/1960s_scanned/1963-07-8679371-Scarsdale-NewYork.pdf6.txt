TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

This time on the eastern horizon looking toward the northwest, you may get the chance to see the waning crescent moon just as it becomes eclipsed. After another hour or two it will move out of the umbra or total eclipse and you may observe it shining normally again.

The corona, or crown, of the sun is very difficult to observe except during those rare, few minutes when the moon completely covers the sun's disc. At such times, the solar prominences, which appear as crimson streamers flaring out from behind the moon's edge, can be seen glowing with the red light of hydrogen. Sometimes delicately colored solar clouds and filaments are also visible in the corona. But within a very short time, the sun's brilliant surface again outshines these phenomena.

This eclipse offers an excellent opportunity to observe the solar prominences as they appear in their full glory. By the use of special telescopes and photographic techniques, a great deal of scientific data may be obtained concerning the physical nature of the sun's atmosphere at the time of the eclipse. Special preparations were thus made to take advantage of this event.
