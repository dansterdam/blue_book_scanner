The image does not contain any photograph or visual representation of a UFO. It appears to be a page from a project blue book document containing written responses to various questions about a UFO sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? NO

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - NO
b. Color - WHITE, ORANGE, AMBER, BLUE

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and see how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object would have been covered? SPACECRAFT LANDED AND WAS ABOUT AS LARGE AS COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wing, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

CRAFT SHAPED LIKE WIDE BEAM, LIKE TWIN CANNISTER ON A BEAM WHICH THE LITTLE MEN CAME FROM. GROUND WAS LIT FROM UNDERSIDE OF CRAFT. CRAFT WENT STRAIGHT UP AND OUT OF SIGHT.
