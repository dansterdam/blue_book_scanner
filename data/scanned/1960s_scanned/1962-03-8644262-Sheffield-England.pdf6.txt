Dear Major Heston A. Jacke,

I feel very grateful for your favor of giving me the dates: March 23rd, to my letter of March 2nd 1964. I have the information regarding your point. I did not want to burden that boy again, even if it was high, because the boy, was telling the truth, even if it was impossible. I told the story to the Air Ministry, that the the light was seen by many and written in the Daily Mail. There is also a magazine, "The Flying Saucer Review" which has the comments.

There is also the comments to be had, the matter that the light of the Unidentified Flying Objects was seen, there was over 40 schoolchildren, could not be fooled, and some men and women, and some sun and cloud particles in the atmosphere. It was in full view, and the sky was quite clear. The light was quite remarkable, and was seen from the city would have caused a panic. The witnesses attended the attention of kind and his friends and relations, and to some extent, the photograph can be explained over the question to the children as usual, and some parents had requested not to go near. It was reported to be the explanation of the which it interest.

sincerely
