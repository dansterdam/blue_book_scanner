"On the night of the 25th of January 1963, a bright flash of light, apparently from an object descending almost vertically, was observed at Nantucket Point on Long Island, New York. The object was detected on a radar scope which showed it to be moving very rapidly, disappearing and reappearing at intervals of about 1/2 second. This happened around 9:50 PM. When Officer Murphy of the Nantucket Point Police Department went to investigate, the object had already disappeared. He could not find any trace of it. According to his report, the object was seen by several other people in the general direction of where he saw the flash. As it was getting dark, he could not make out any definite shape or size. He said the flash was of short duration, perhaps 1-2 seconds, and was very bright, lighting up the entire area for a moment. The experience and his only remark have were, 'I've never seen anything like that before.' If there are any other witnesses, we should be glad to hear from them and this information could be very helpful. Also, if there are any other incidents we should know about, please let us know, as we believe you could contribute greatly to this study."
