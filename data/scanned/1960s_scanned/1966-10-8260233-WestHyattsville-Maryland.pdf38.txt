Dear Miss [redacted],

Your letter to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was forwarded to us for action.

With reference to the ability of investigating reports on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and of evaluating any possible threat to our national security, this program since its inception in 1947. 

It should be very difficult to evaluate your sighting at this late date. However, I am enclosing the forms in which we used in reporting on these matters which is used as an official report to the Air Force. If you complete and forward this form, we will be glad to evaluate your sighting.

I have also inclosed other material pertaining to UFOs which I hope you will find informative.

Your interest in our program is appreciated.

Sincerely,
GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
