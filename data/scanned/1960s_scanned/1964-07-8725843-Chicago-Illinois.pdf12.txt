The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document states:

"About 1:30 AM on April 19, 1964 an object was observed in the sky at Chicago, Illinois. The object was globular in shape and appeared to be emitting light. The light was bright and seemed to fluctuate in intensity. The object was observed for over an hour and perhaps longer, as the observer had to leave the observation site. The object seemed to be stationary, and there is no indication that it moved during the observation period. The observer is a reliable person who is interested in astronomy and flying objects in general. He states he cannot explain what he observed, and believes it was not the same type of object as the usual aircraft or satellite."
