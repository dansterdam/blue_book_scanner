The fifth witness said the object made a V-turn and hovered momentarily before speeding away.

Several witnesses stated they saw no appendages, wheels, or other external features on the object. The witnesses state they saw no streens or smoke from the object and described it as silently operating. All reported that the object gave off a bright light which illuminated the area.

At the place where the object touched the ground, the witnesses found an area approximately 15 ft x 10 ft which was flattened as if something heavy had landed.
