The image contains two illustrations. The first illustration is a compass rose diagram with the cardinal directions labeled. The second illustration is a sketch of a person standing on a road with mountains in the background and an inset of what appears to be a close-up view of some terrain.

The text is as follows:

"4. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "T" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "T" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A STRAIGHT LINE. INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BY AN ARROW. INDICATE ALSO THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON IN RELATION TO THE SKETCH."
