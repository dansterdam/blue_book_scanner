The image contains a diagram showing the estimated position and movement of a UFO object. The diagram includes labels for a "TV antenna" and the "Outline of house across street". There is also text describing the witness's observations, including that the object had solid white and blue light parts, and that the position of the object shifted slightly during the observation.

Supplement to Report

The witness, Mrs. Grace McEachern, was not inclined to write lengthy statements in detail. The following information was obtained by oral conversation with the Air Force personnel:

6. The sky was clear, at least in vicinity of object.
7. The stars were visible, but the moon was not noticed. 
9. The object first looked circular and solid white. Instead of remaining the same size, it grew larger and assumed a disc-like shape. During this transition, a blue light appeared toward the lower center portion of the object and became more pronounced. The object appeared brighter than the moon and a bit smaller. The object remained in the same general location for a few minutes before moving away at a moderate rate of speed.
