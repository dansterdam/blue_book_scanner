The image appears to contain a filled-out form from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The form includes several multiple-choice questions related to the observation of a UFO phenomenon. 

The handwritten responses on the form indicate that the observer described the UFO as resembling a "miniature ship with a glowing edge", and that they did not notice any sound, odor, or heat emanating from the phenomenon. Additionally, the observer did not notice any physical evidence or disturbance to the ground from the UFO.
