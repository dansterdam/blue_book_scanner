On the evening of August 3, 1961, the writer was alerted that a sighting had been reported from a farm in the Kentland, Indiana area. The writer, accompanied by several officers, went to the location to investigate. The persons reporting the incident were a husband and wife who lived on an isolated farm. 

They stated that at approximately 9:30 p.m. on August 3, 1961, they were in their farm yard when they observed a bright light in the sky to the south. The light was moving slowly and erratically, at times appearing to stop and hover, and then move off in a different direction. The light was observed for about 20 minutes before it disappeared from view.

The witnesses stated that the object appeared to be circular or disc-shaped, and it seemed to be giving off a brilliant white light. At times it appeared to change colors, emitting shades of red and green. They stated that it was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known type of aircraft that they were familiar with.

The witnesses were quite disturbed by the incident and insisted that the writer make a report of their observations. They seemed sincere and were obviously attempting to describe something they had never seen before. The writer believes their report to be authentic and worthy of inclusion in project files.
