This is as much as I can tell you at the present time concerning the case. Several interesting points emerge from this report. First, the witnesses apparently saw something which they could not identify as a known aircraft, and it displayed some unusual features. The fact that the object was seen by two persons at the same time, with their descriptions generally agreeing, lends some credence to the report. However, the variation in their estimates of the object's size and distance from their location, as well as the fact that no photographs were taken, make it impossible to arrive at a definite conclusion concerning the nature and identity of the object. The fact that it was seen for only a short period of time, and that the witnesses were not close to it, weakens the case somewhat from the standpoint of obtaining conclusive data. Overall, this report, while of interest, does not provide enough information to warrant a firm judgment as to the identification or origin of the object.
