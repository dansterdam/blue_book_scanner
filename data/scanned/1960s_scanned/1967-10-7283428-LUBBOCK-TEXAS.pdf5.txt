1. Lubbock Municipal Airport is located 4 miles south of the point of starting. The turn to final approach path of Runway 17 (active runway of 135 end of observations) passes approximately along the flight path of the observed object.

2. The individual concerned and her sister (14), brother (12) were interviewed on 13 Oct 1967 at 1550L. The flight path of the observed object falls on the specific pattern of Lubbock Municipal Airport. The landing lights, and confirmation on landing traffic by Lubbock Airport controlling agencies, lead this investigator to believe that the object sighted was an airplane landing at Lubbock Municipal Airport.
