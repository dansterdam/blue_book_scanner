"Dear Capt. the rest of the story after the disappearance is this, night watchman who watched all night said he saw a bright light that seemed to come down, hover about a minute then shoot straight up out of sight, no soun no nothing. Just stood and watched. He was sure it was no earthly craft. I hope you will pass this info on to who ever is in charge of those matters. Your Very Sincerely"
