DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES FEB. 17-23, 1969

The surface weather map presents the synoptic weather situation over a large area of the United States. The main features are the location and trend of pressure systems, fronts, and precipitation areas. Isobars are drawn at intervals of 4 millibars, and temperatures are in degrees F.

The precipitation chart shows the areas of precipitation that occurred during the preceding 24 hours, ending at 6:00 a.m. EST on the day of the map. The shaded areas indicate the amounts of precipitation in inches for the 24-hour period, as shown by the scale. These data are obtained from a large number of stations by the National Weather Service, and are labeled in the scale in inches.

The surface wind chart shows the wind direction and wind speed at a height of 10 meters above the ground. The wind direction is shown by the wind arrow, and the speed in knots is given by the barbs along the shaft. The length of the barbs indicates the speed, and a full barb represents 10 knots. The winds are based on observations made by the National Weather Service at the same time as the pressure data.

The picture shows a typical daily weather pattern for the continental United States during the winter season. The frontal systems, high and low pressure centers, and precipitation areas are the main features of interest. The presentation allows a synoptic view of weather conditions over a large area, and permits analysis of the weather trends and possible future developments.
