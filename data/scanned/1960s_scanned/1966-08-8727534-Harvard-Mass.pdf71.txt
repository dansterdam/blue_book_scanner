Dear Sirs:

I am reading a book about project Blue book and find it most interesting. I am 15 a pretty wild school and in the class room that I am in so we all are U.F.O. lovers. Whenever the teacher speaks I read this book because nearly every take place on the subject of U.F.O.S and each time we see a object that is unusual over the lake they say s unusual looking object hover over the lake and somewhat like the ones we see here what I my would not are we. 

In bad weather of August 15, 1966 at 2:45 Aug. 4 it was lying flat on my back seeing the stars shine brightly above me when I has-tily saw in the corner of my eye an unusual object flew across the sky in a straight angle. It was a unusually bright light that looked like the moon. Then I went into our family room to see if my thought was right. It was not however because the moon was my thought and why I couldn'tin the other room. Then a strange light appearded.then the light disappeared, the light went away and they disappeared until 3 am in the morning. They were brighter than any dog I had ever seen. It was strange it were than anything I see and I sweat is what it was I de not know and I will never forget it!!

Sincerely,
