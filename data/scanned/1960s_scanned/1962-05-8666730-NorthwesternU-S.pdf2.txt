Here is an article out of the "Today Magazine" that is a poster. On May 23 th a firelike multicolored fireball streaked over Vancouver British Columbia. It was thought to be a meteor, but some questioned whether it was. It was not a meteor. 

The object passed overhead at about 400 ft. But didn't make a sound. Vancouver sUl reported that it broke up the "MOUNTED" at one time. Granney (?) their necks to see the object. An EXCITED POLICE heard it and saw it. BLUE AND GOLD AND SILVER. AT POLICE STATIONS NEWSPAPERS OFFICES RADIO STATIONS and WITH excited queries.

How lets see the Holy Bible 5 verses 1 From the Whatver a.f.b. 

TURN I KNEELED AND LIFTED UP MINE EYES, AND LOOKED, AND BEHOLD, 
A CUP WAS IN HIS HAND: ABOUT 18-20 inches. 20/36 lbs. The rest that it all be read.

Dangerously
