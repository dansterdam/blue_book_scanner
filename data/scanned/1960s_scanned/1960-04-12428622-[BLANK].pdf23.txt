Some years ago the Air Force did me the honor of adopting—at least semi-officially—my definition of Flying Saucers. "A flying saucer is any aerial sighting or phenomenon that remains unexplained long enough for someone to write a report about it."

My acquaintance with Flying Saucers, as reports, goes back twelve years when, as an astronomer at Ohio State, and hence quite close to Wright Field and the Air Technical Intelligence Center, I was asked to review some 200 reports to see how many could be explained on an astronomical basis. Most unfortunately, the really interesting ones could not be. There were many meteors and fireballs, and occasionally the planets, as in one case where Jupiter and its four bright satellites was reported as a mother space ship and its brood of small craft. But the real lulus, silver disks that silently dashed about the sky at night, luminous objects that landed and from which emerged little men, or as in the case of two FBI operatives I interviewed (quite a switch—usually they interview me) who were scared witless (the word is witless) by a large version of a child's Christmas toy top that buzzed them on a lonely road in South Carolina at 2:00 a.m.—none of these reports had, at least in my mind, a ready explanation.
