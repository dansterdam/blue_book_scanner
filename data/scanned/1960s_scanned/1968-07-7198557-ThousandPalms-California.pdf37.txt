Dear Air Force,
Before you get my reply to your September 24 letter, I pray may tell you that I have already most of the details from another source. I am most anxious for more help.

Thank you, Blry Oryx

P.S. Don't you get the send me another form to fill up. I have read the cover page which warn that coming about one or more of these subjects are not permissible. At least one time close to my heart.

Thank you again.
