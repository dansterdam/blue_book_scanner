"Objects. No case either in the park or in Kirksville seems to have been observed that could have been seen as a UFO, LUFON reports. Local airports were asked if they had any UFO reports during this period, particularly concerning objects flying at low levels. Nothing was reported. The case is therefore inconclusive. Number of objects reported as sightings later confirmed negative or uncertain on further examination. The case is being carried as inconclusive as confirming data."
