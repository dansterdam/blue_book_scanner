Dear Sir:

We were very glad to get your letter during the third week in November regarding the sighting of some unidentified flying objects which occurred during the evening of September 3, 1965. In other words, both Pl. Hunt and I had submitted reports on this sighting to your office and evidently you had received them. 

From the context, it seems both the observers were an airline pilot and a commercial pilot, and the sightings occurred at around 9:00 PM on September 3, 1965. The sightings lasted for several minutes and the objects exhibited characteristics that suggested they were not conventional aircraft. The letter discusses the observers' opinions and concludes that the sightings were "no illusion" and that "what we were seeing was the complete official story."

The letter also mentions that a Captain (Bartman?) was in the Air Force and witnessed the same objects, and that the objects disappeared in a way that made it impossible to determine what they were. Another fact mentioned is that the observation period lasted nearly 2:00 AM, between midnight and 2:00 AM, and that the observers reported the sightings to the police station before being interviewed.
