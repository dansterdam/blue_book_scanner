SAF-OTCC/Miss Turnure/76226/September 12, 1968

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This replies to your letter of September 3, 1968, in which you reported that you and members of your family have seen an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what you have seen. However, if each of you will complete one of the enclosed questionnaires and return them in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to evaluate the details and make an evaluation. It is very important that each member of your family who wishes to report this sighting complete a separate questionnaire. We are allowed to accept reports only from those persons who are reported personally by the viewer.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. The United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate identification.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the material we are sending.

Sincerely,

JAMES K. AIKMAN
