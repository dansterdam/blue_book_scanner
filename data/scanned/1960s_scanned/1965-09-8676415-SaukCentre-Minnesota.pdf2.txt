The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from the Project Blue Book investigation regarding a reported unidentified flying object sighting.

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],
Please refer to the delay in replying to your letter regarding your unidentified flying object sighting. The volume of UFO reports received at this time requires a considerable amount of time for investigation and reply. 
Your sighting of September 11, 1966 has characteristics of aircraft observed by several witnesses. However, because of the limited information contained in the report, it is difficult to make a conclusive determination. As discussed with you on the telephone, the object would appear to be a normal aircraft. The fact that the object was at a very high altitude may account for the difficulty in identifying it at the time of the sighting.
Thank you for your interest in our program; I regret that it took us so long to reply.
Sincerely,
GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
