Braidwood Sees Object in Sky
Braidwood was kept awake Tuesday night as residents peered at a bright object in the southern sky.
An AF Jet interceptor from Truax Field, Milwaukee, Wis. was sent to the area early today to investigate.
It was finally determined that two celestial bodies were putting on their brightest show of the year.
William Gomora, Reed Township Supervisor and a member of the Will County Civil Defense Committee, notified the bright object in the southern sky which was there from about 9 p.m. Tuesday until daybreak today.
Gomora called Robert McFadden, Will County Civil Defense Director, who notified the FFA and the Air Defense Command about the bright object seen in the Braidwood area. Gomora was on the telephone almost 2 hours while the plane circled.
Robert F. Price, head of the Physics and Astronomy Departments at Joliet Junior College, when called early today regarding the mysterious "flying object", said apparently either Jupiter or Saturn was putting on a bright show. He said Jupiter was the brighter of the two.
