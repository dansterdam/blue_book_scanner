The text in the document is as follows:

Dear Sirs:

I would like to ask you some questions about flying saucers.

1. Are there such things as flying saucers?
2. If so, where do they come from? 
3. Are there any people piloting these saucers?
4. If so, what do they look like?

"The Day I Think I Saw a Flying Saucer" 

On the day of April 25, 1961 my friend and I were playing in our front yard. It was about 3:30 P.M. We glanced up in the sky, and there was a round saucer-like object hovering above the trees. We called our neighbor and he also saw it. He said, "Look is it, there it is." It was silver-like object in the sky. First it came down quite close and then it went up again. A plan. But I'm pretty sure it was a flying saucer.

Yours truly,
(Signature)

P.S. "Please try to answer the questions I sent with this letter when it is convenient for me to provide to a friend and my friends who have also seen flying saucers."
