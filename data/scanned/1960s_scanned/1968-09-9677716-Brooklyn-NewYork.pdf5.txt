The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch is a compass rose with instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction of a UFO sighting. The smaller sketches show different perspectives of a landscape, with a person standing in the foreground.

4A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "0" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE OBJECT MOVED. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS LATTER SKETCH.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "0" AT THE POSITION TO WHICH IT MOVED. CONNECT THE AGAND "X" WITH A STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIGZAG LINE. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS LATTER SKETCH.
