Dear Mrs.,

I am a amateur astronomer, age 47. I am also interested in the subject of unidentified flying objects. Time and again I see stories of these saucers that interest you and I feel we could have an interesting conversation. But I do have one small reservation. I am sure that observes a good explanation about one month ago I saw thing 150 tochometer, I was 7&75 beanocular, I had it in my hand and then I saw it moving from the west to the east. it was a very clear day and then I saw it coming from the west to the east. it was a verydistinct object and no other figure showed. I don't say this because it might give the impression that I may have observed a flying saucer. It may have been some other aircraft and perhaps going on some routine flight. But suppose if it was a flying saucer. I tried to figure it out but I couldn't. At least it was no aeroplane or any other type of known aircraft we have. I was no amused because it traveled too fast and had no tail or wing structure. In fact what you think it is ,

Sincerely yours,

Robert L. Lindner
