5. DESCRIPTION: Mr. Ames observed a bright white, oval-shaped object moving slowly in a westerly direction approximately 40 degrees above the horizon. The object appeared to be extremely high in altitude. It was observed to maneuver or change course during the sighting. No sound was heard. Weather conditions were clear.
