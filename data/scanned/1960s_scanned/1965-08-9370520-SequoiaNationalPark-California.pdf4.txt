Ge Sterling:
While on a recent trip myself and five friends spotted 4 luminous objects in the sky which we believe to be satellite passing over. 
It was sighted on Wednesday, August 25, Thursday August 26, and Friday August 27 from 8:40pm to 11:30pm each evening. It was moving very rapidly from northwest to southeast, and seemed to change both color and direction at times. It was about the size of a star and remained visible from 3 to 10 minutes each night. We feel quite certain that these were not stars or satellites as we are all familiar with their appearance. They were much brighter and moved with a speed far exceeding any satellite I have ever seen. 
It is my wish that this report be added to your files for whatever interest it may have.

Sincerely yours,
