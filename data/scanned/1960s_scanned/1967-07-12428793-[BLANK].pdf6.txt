There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book report, containing text discussing astronomical observations and extraterrestrial life.

DR. MENZEL, OF HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY, AND AUTHOR OF SEVERAL BOOKS, HAS STATED THAT OF THE MANY ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, NONE HAVE EVER PHOTOGRAPHED AN OBJECT THAT REMOTELY RESEMBLED A SPACESHIP. SINCE 1957, HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS OF MOON WATCH TEAMS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE WATCHED THE SKIES, BUT NO MOON WATCH TEAM HAS YET REPORTED THE PRESENCE OF A SPACESHIP. AN IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT THE SPACE DETECTION AND TRACKING SYSTEM WOULD CERTAINLY DETECT AN INTERLOPER FROM BEYOND OUR PLANET THAT WOULD JOIN THE PARADE OF SOME THOUSAND OBJECTS NOW IN ORBIT. TO DATE, SPADATS HAS NEVER GIVEN ANY INDICATION THAT THEY BELIEVE AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL VEHICLE HAS EVER ORBITED EARTH. PROJECT OZMA, AN EARLY U.S. ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE, WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. NO "INTELLIGENT" RADIO SIGNALS WERE NOTED DURING ITS ONE YEAR OPERATIONAL PROGRAM. DR. MENZEL STANDS BEHIND HIS BELIEF THAT HUMAN BEINGS NOW ARE ON THE THRESHOLD OF SPACE. VISITS TO AND FROM OTHER WORLDS MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE, BRINGING NEW FACTS AND NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF REALITY THAT WE CANNOT NOW IMAGINE. NO EVIDENCE YET FOUND INDICATES THAT SUCH VISITS HAVE BEGUN. NO FACT SO FAR DETERMINED SUGGESTS THAT A SINGLE UFO HAS ORIGINATED OUTSIDE OUR OWN PLANET. THE LEADING SOVIET ASTRONOMERS HAVE VOICED SIMILAR OPINIONS REGARDING EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE.
