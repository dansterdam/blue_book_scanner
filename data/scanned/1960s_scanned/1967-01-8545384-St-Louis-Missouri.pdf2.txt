ATTN OF: 375 (OP) (Mr McPherson/3612)

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting

TO: FTD (TDETR)

1. Forwarded for action by your headquarters in accordance with paragraph 7a, AFR 80-17.

2. This report was thoroughly investigated and determined to be an Ozark Airlines Convair ADLER 580 flight descending Lambert Municipal Airport on an IFR approach. The aircraft was identified as such and flew directly towards Mrs. McPherson's location. This constitutes supporting data for the contention that the only the same caused a report of this sighting.
