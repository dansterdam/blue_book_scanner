FRANCE
LOOKING UFO
Le Monde (Life of October 11, 1965)
Around 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, October 9th, several people, including a machine in the shape of a man, saw in the sky over Touryal, a saucer-shaped object moving at a great height.
One of the witnesses explained that he was looking at his office, he had seen the object in the sky, and had immediately called them, and they all saw the saucer.
"It is impossible to say for certain whether an aircraft or not," he explained. We were unable to see it with the naked eye, and the question of its being an aircraft," he explained, "was at a great height." The flying saucer remained several hours, and the other side was black. Then, as a disk, it split, the machine went on his way.
