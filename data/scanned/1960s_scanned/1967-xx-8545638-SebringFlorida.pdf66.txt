The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text in the document appears to be a personal account or statement describing the observer's experience of watching an unidentified object in the sky.

"I was watching a 'walter creek' craft at approximately between 6:30 - 7:00 p.m. on 3/26/67. I received a call from my daughter stating that her two friends saw a flying saucer on the West Chester Street in the vicinity. They came out just in time to see the craft stall, then it fired up again and out of sight. Nothing out of the ordinary by my estimate."
