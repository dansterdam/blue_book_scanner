The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter dated October 27, 1966 from George E. Freeman, Jr., Chief of the Civil Branch Division of the Office of Information, to a recipient in New Haven, Connecticut.

The text in the document is as follows:

OCT 27 1966

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your recent letter requesting information on your observation of ECHO 1 which was observed on August 9, 1964.  

It is felt that you observed the satellite ECHO 1 which was approximately 11 miles in diameter and had a stellar magnitude of plus 3 and was visible in a northeasterly direction as it passed south of starfield.

Thank you for reporting your observation to us. Your interest in our program is appreciated.

Sincerely,

GEORGE E. FREEMAN, JR.
