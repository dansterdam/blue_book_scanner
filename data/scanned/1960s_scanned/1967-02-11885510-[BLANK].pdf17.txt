The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an excerpt from a document discussing the duration of civilizations and interstellar communication. As an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

civilization has had its ups and downs. The ancient Romans, for instance, were much more highly civilized than their descendants a thousand years later. Therefore, there is no need to postulate a complete destruction of our civilization in order to lose our ability for interstellar communication.

The duration of any civilization is accordingly a guess, and this factor makes all discussions about interstellar contacts very nearly a pure exchange of verbage. Shklovskiy, for instance, develops a formula for the average distance between civilizations, d, depending on the time, T, of the duration of the existence of stars and, t, the duration of civilization:

d = 5.2 (T/t)^1/3 parsecs

If we put T = 10^10 years as commonly accepted, and t = 10^4 years we compute the average distance between two civilizations in our galaxy to be 520 parsecs or about 1,700 light years.

Shklovskiy is evidently afraid of his own result and is willing to take t = 10^5 to 10^6 years. Even in this case the distances come out on the order of 100 parsecs or 300 light years.

Similar calculations by L.M. Gindilis, reported in an article entitled "The Possibilities of Communication with Extraterrestrial Civilizations (Zemlya I Vselennaya, No. 1, 1965) are summarized in Appendix I. Although the assumptions used in Gindilis's calculations are different from Shklovskiy's, Gindilis concludes
