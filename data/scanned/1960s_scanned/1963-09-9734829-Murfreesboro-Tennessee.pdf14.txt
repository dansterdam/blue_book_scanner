Southampton mystery
On August 11, 1963, a letter which
attracted widespread attention was
received by the "Daily Mail". This
letter, written in a feminine hand,
stated that during the night of August
9, 1963, a very peculiar object had
been seen hovering over Southampton
Water, and that photographs had been
taken of the object. The writer of the
letter stated that he/she had deliberately
delayed sending the information to the
press until the following day, as he/she
feared that if the information was
released at once, "certain people" might
take steps to prevent it from being
made public. The letter went on to
state that the photographs would be
sent to the "Daily Mail" the next day.
However, the photographs were never
received, and to date no further
communication has been received from
the person who wrote the original letter.
