Captain:
Civilian airman report - investigation - sighting, aerial phenomena:
Gulf Stream, Longitude 147W, Latitude 26N, Pacific Ocean - Date 8 July 1964
We were on course not quite NW flying at 28,000 feet cruising speed, when approximately 18:43GMT we noticed rapidly approaching object in our 1 o'clock position at about 6 miles range. Object appeared to be round, bright white in color and was moving with tremendous speed. After reaching closest point it appeared to accelerate and climbed out of sight at a rate of approximately 30 degrees per second. Total elapsed time from first sighting to disappearance was less than 10 seconds. We were all quite amazed by this observation as were by it. I request any information you can provide on this incident.
