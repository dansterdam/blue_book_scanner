DECLASSIFICATION OF THE INFLATION SHELTER PLAN INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING:

The inflation shelter plan included the following:

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE INFLATION SHELTER - The shelter is to be a prefabricated aluminum building, approximately 50' x 100' in size, to be erected with little on-site construction. It will accommodate approximately 150 persons for shelter in event of a nuclear attack.

2. STRENGTH OF THE SHELTER BUILDING AND ITS CAPACITY TO WITHSTAND EFFECTS OF NUCLEAR ATTACK - The building has been designed to withstand the effects of overpressure and initial radiation resulting from a nuclear explosion. The overall design is based on an assumed overpressure of 5 psi and a radiation dose of 300 R for a 2 week period of occupancy.

3. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS - Analysis of the proposed shelter indicated the following performance characteristics: better protection and faster assembly than the previously proposed site; better performance of scientific equipment the shelter would contain; and reasons for selecting the shelter from the previously proposed site.

AGENCY'S RECOMMENDATION FOR CONSTRUCTION OF INFLATION SHELTER UNDER THE 1961 FISCAL YEAR:

NCAR is requesting $30,000 for the construction of the inflation shelter. Motion was made and currently proposed.

Further discussion of the inflation shelter indicated that some defects existed because the cost estimate was not firm and because the existing claim of low cost made it impossible to obtain contractor bids. It was impossible to wait two years to obtain funds to build a shelter and that no contractor would make a bid on the inflation shelter that NCAR had considered and had been abandoned for reasons which included structural penumbra and utility. Defect cost comparisons did not warrant the inflation shelter cost estimate as possible.

AGENDA ITEM 3 - PROPOSAL FOR SUPPORT OF THE SPECTRA-STRATOSCOPE:

The panel had requested at the last meeting that NCAR obtain comments from outside NCAR on the proposal to Dr. Roberts to prepare a more definitive and limited program. Dr. Roberts indicated that limited funds had been tentatively assigned to the program as a manager and that Kiepenheuer had decided to terminate the program and that Kiepenheuer had proposed to cease support for balloon, helium, etc. from a US agency. The importance and that the support required of NCAR is fundamentally operational in nature.

ACTION NO. 2: THE PANEL ENDORSED THE SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSAL AND RECOMMENDED THAT NCAR SUPPORT THE PROGRAM, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT COSTS TO NCAR WOULD BE NOMINAL SUPPORT COSTS.

MR. TALLY, REFERRING TO AGENDA ITEM 4 - THE IQSY EXPEDITION IN INDIA, DISCUSSED THE BACKGROUND OF THE IQSY PROGRAM. HE SAID THAT REQUIREMENTS FROM NCAR THAT IQSY HAD SUGGESTED THAT NCAR MANAGE THE PROGRAM. HE SAID THAT IQSY POINTED OUT THAT NCAR WOULD BE EXPECTED TO CONTRACT WITH AN INDUSTRIAL GROUP TO RUN THE PROGRAM AND THAT NCAR WOULD PROVIDE A PROGRAM MANAGER AND A SCIENTIFIC COORDINATOR.
