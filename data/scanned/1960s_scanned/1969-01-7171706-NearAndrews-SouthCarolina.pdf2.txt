Here is the text from the document:

DID THE PHENOMENON:
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE? 
CHANGE COLOR?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE IN SIZE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE? 
MAKE A NOISE?
LEAVE ANY VISIBLE TRAIL?

14. WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON? IT WAS SO BRILLIANT, LARGE, AND DOSE CLOSE TO BE THE BIGGEST OBJECT I HAVE EVER SEEN AND IT WAS APPROACHING ME RAPIDLY UNTIL IT SEEMED TO FILL MY ENTIRE FIELD OF VISION.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR? IT FIRST SEEMED TO VANISH.

DO THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? IT WAS BEHIND SOME TREETOPS TO BEGIN SHORTLY AFTER I FIRST SIGHTED IT.
