A. Suggestions for Further Exploration

In case additional information on the possible availability or the actual history of the specific sample is desired by the Air Force, we suggest the following:

A. Domestic Paper Manufacturers

There are several companies in this country which are capable of making products very similar to the unknown. We recommend discussion with these companies to determine whether or not any of these compete with each other in this particular segment of the paper industry. Contacts with these companies would be helpful in determining whether or not any of these compete with the sample, and how common this type of paper is in this particular segment of the paper industry.

John A. Manning Paper Co., Inc., P.O. Box 338, Troy,
New York 12181 (Geo. E. Lawson)
Southern Paper Co., 100 Canal St., Windsor Locks, 
Connecticut (Geo. D. Knight)
Corval Tissues, Inc., Middletown, Ohio
Beloit Paper Corporations, 1120 Broadway, New York,
New York (J. T. Grovera)
Brassell Paper Corporation, Mesquidine, Okla., Industries:
Pisgah Forest, North Carolina

In turn, discussion with each of these companies may develop further contacts worth investigating.

B. Users and/or Distributors

At least two types of organizations would be interested in handling papers comparable to the unknown for use as test issues. We suggest that the following be contacted as converters or distributors of paper for test issues:
