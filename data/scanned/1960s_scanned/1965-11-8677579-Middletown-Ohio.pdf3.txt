AF To Hear
Saucer Story
The Air Force will be in Middletown tomorrow
to hear Mrs. Lucien Tucker, 516 Young St., and investi-
gate her report of seeing an unidentified flying object
last Thursday evening.

Mrs. Tucker, a church organist, told the Middletown
newspaper that just before dark as she was driving into
Middletown, the object came up from the woods about a
mile and a quarter and came down so close to the window
of her car that she could have reached out and touched it.

Mrs. Tucker told the newspaper that she and
three teen-age companions were returning from the
church, and three teen-age companions were entering
the church, when the object was first sighted at 6:15 p.m.
last Thursday as they were turning around at Middletown. The object was followed until it landed under some trees on the Tucker farm, about a quarter-mile away, and then took off. They said the TV picture was knocked off and the lights flickered.

"I intented for awhile and it sounded more like a jet coming," Mrs. Tucker said.

She explained that she thought by more about 10 minutes what she saw has been reported in the local journal earlier this week. Other residents in the area have reported seeing unusual light formations in the area and indeed, something thought was a jet in trouble has been reported to have landed from the north and then departed, according to the newspaper account.

Mrs. Tucker was quoted as saying she and the three teen-age companions had never seen anything like it before. The object was described as being about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, glowing and shooting off sparks. Mrs. Tucker reportedly heard a humming sound and the lights in her house from the north and either landed or hovered - sending out a beam of light.
