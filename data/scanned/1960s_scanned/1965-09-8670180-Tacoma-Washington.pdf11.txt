East Maidstone Phenomenon

The 'Sunday Mirror' of September 5 1965 tells of a luminous object which was seen by several people in the East Maidstone district shortly before 10 p.m. on September 2. The item continues:- "It was an orange, lighted object and appeared to be stationary. It was about the size of a very large star and seemed to vanish gradually, dimming and disappearing after about a minute. It surprised local people and was apparently witnessed altogether."
