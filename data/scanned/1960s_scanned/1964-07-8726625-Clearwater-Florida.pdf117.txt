Dear Capt. French:

This letter concerns the U.F.O. sightings of July 22, 1964 in the vicinity of Clearwater, Florida.

The sighting was made by these independent witnesses and their details are furnished as follows:

The southernmost line of position was obtained from sighting made from the writer's residence and another close-by witness. This sighting was made at 11:10 P.M. Eastern Daylight Savings Time. The object appeared to be several miles off-shore moving in a northeasterly direction at an estimated speed of 700 to 800 m.p.h.

The sighting of the Air Force was obtained from an Air Force pilot stationed at MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida. This sighting was made at approximately 11:30 P.M. Eastern Daylight Savings Time. The object appeared to be about 10 miles off-shore and was first observed to the southwest and then moved to the northeast at a very high rate of speed. 

The altitude of the object was estimated to be between 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon. The object was described as a large bright light, somewhat elliptical in shape. It had a definite forward motion, first observed to the southwest and then moving in a northeasterly direction. The object's path was not erratic but appeared to be smooth and steady. The object was observed for about one minute.

In the writer's opinion, the lights observed were similar in appearance to those of earlier sightings which have been attributed to satellites and aircraft. However, the speed and altitude of the object would seem to eliminate these possibilities and it is felt that the object was an unidentified flying object.
