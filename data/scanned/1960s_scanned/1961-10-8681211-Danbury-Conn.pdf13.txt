SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1961

CAPTAIN THOMAS L. CAREY, USAF
ASSISTANT INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
HEADQUARTERS, AIR FORCE CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH LABORATORIES
BEDFORD, MASSACHUSETTS

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
REFERENCE: YOUR LETTER DATED 11 OCTOBER 1961

I CAN ADD LITTLE TO THE REPORT I SUBMITTED A YEAR AGO IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INCIDENT, EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THE OBJECT I SAW THAT NIGHT SEEMED TO BE INTELLIGENTLY OPERATED, THOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE ITS EXACT NATURE OR SIZE. IT APPEARED TO BE ALMOST CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, WITH SOME KIND OF CENTRAL LIGHT OR ILLUMINATION.

SINCE THAT TIME, I HAVE HAD OCCASION TO DISCUSS THIS INCIDENT WITH SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ALSO OBSERVERS, AND THEY HAVE CONFIRMED MY OWN OBSERVATIONS. HOWEVER, NONE OF US WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE TRUE NATURE OF THE OBJECT. WE WERE ALL, QUITE FRANKLY, MYSTIFIED BY WHAT WE SAW THAT NIGHT.

I HOPE THIS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION IS HELPFUL, AND I WILL BE GLAD TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL DATA I CAN, SHOULD YOU REQUIRE IT.

SINCERELY, 
THOMAS L. CAREY
