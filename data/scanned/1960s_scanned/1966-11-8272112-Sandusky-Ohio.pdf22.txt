August 19, 1966.
This came out of the Canadian National Exhibition grounds.
Seen at approximately 11:00 p.m.
Seen for 3-5 mins.
Seen in the western sky at 45Â° above horizon.
What about the same brightness as Venus.
(But it wasn't Venus)
Mentioned oddly moving up and down a great deal, quite the hell off or high rate.
That's a remarkable sighting.
