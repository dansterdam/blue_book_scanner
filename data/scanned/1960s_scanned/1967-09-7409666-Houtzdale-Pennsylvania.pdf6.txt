There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document that appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report.

The text contained in the document is as follows:

"Some detail as to the things my senses noticed when i looked up and saw the object described above, A star like object that shmed brighter than any star or planet seen before, The object appeared to be stationary in the sky, higher than any cloud and lower than the stars. The object remained somewhat visible for a period of approximately ten minutes. Once I noticed the object it seemed to shine brighter and maintain its position. After about ten minutes it began to dim and moved slowly toward the northwest, Finally disappearing from view, I'm attempting to give a brief account of what I witnessed. I'm unable to state with certainty that this could not have been an airplane or some other terrestrial object. However, the speed of its apparent motion and the brightness of the light given off were unusual features that deserve some investigation. I'm reporting this incident because I feel it may be of some importance in the study of unidentified flying objects. Kindly consider this matter and let me know if you have any additional questions."
