The image appears to be a scanned page of a document and it includes a drawing at the bottom right section of the page. The drawing depicts a UFO, represented as a cylindrical shape with a dome on top. The main body of the UFO is shaded, suggesting it's dark in color, and the dome is annotated with the words "bright yellow." The handwriting appears to indicate characteristics of the observed phenomenon such as "dark greyish," and "domination" next to the main body, with "bright yellow" written alongside the dome.
