Mr. [Redacted]
Seward Post Office
Seward, Pennsylvania

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

Thank you for your recent letters describing possible satellite-related sightings. The objects which you have described are similar to similar sightings reported to this office.

Satellite decays are distinguished from meteor observations by the direction of movement, the duration would be slightly longer than that described in your letters.

The Air Force appreciates your improved meteor sightings and is interested in observations that may shed light on the characteristics are important.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.
Major, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
