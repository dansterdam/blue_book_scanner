The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an observation made in Akron, Ohio on October 10, 1962. The text states that a "mother and daughter looking into the west saw what appeared to be a twin sun" and that "it appeared smaller than the sun." The document mentions that this phenomenon persisted for about 15-20 minutes, and that Prof. Menzel could not explain this occurrence.
