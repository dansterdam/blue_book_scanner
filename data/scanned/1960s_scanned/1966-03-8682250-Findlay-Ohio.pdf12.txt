Transcription of the text in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
IT ROSE VERTICALLY AND THEN MOVED OUT OF SIGHT AT A TERRIFIC SPEED DOWNWARD

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound LITTLE LIGHT
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
5 ESTIMATED THE SIZE AS BEING 1/2 SO SMALL AS FULL MOON

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially unusual trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
