From Our Point Of View:
Flying Saucer Reports
Come On Big News Day

One of the topics of conversation that seems to have been prevalent over southeastern Michigan last Sunday was the reports of unidentified flying objects, usually referred to as "flying saucers." A small, bright light was seen crossing the sky, according to reports, and a group of Hillsdale College students who were watching a football game supposedly saw a bright light in the sky that night, which was followed by a group of smaller objects that seemed to descend at a high rate of speed.

This type of sighting has been common over various parts of the country, and in some instances certain individuals have claimed that "flying saucers" landed and their occupants emerged. Some reporters claim that the sightings are due to pranksters with balloons, flares, and the like, and that the stories of landings are the result of overly imaginative witnesses. On the other hand, certain military and scientific groups are seriously investigating the possibility that some of these objects may be of extra-terrestrial origin.

IT IS CERTAIN that these flying saucer reports come on the heels of a well-publicized story about a UFO sighting in Mississippi, where a former Air Force officer and a sheriff's deputy both reported seeing a strange object hovering over a highway. The popular notion that these objects are extra-terrestrial beings from some distant planet is continually being strengthened by reports of landings and encounters with their occupants.

One of the scores of telephone calls to the news media regarding the reported sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over southwestern Michigan on Wednesday as an Air Force investigating team continued its probe of earlier sightings.

Reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) darting about the countryside were received from individuals in Hillsdale and Washtenaw counties, where similar sightings were reported Sunday and Monday night.

In another development, a 16-year-old Monroeville, Michigan, youth told authorities that he and two companions saw a strange object hovering above a field Friday night.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, a top Air Force scientific consultant, said Wednesday after interviewing witnesses of earlier sightings, Dr. Hynek said that the Michigan sightings were "some of the most impressive incidents" he has investigated.

Commenting on the Michigan sightings, Dr. Hynek said: "These reports are more consistent than most of the sightings I have investigated."

One witness, Mrs. Dorothy G. Dexter, who reported a flying object over her home Sunday night, said Wednesday that vandals had smashed the windshield of her car.
