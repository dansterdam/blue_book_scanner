THERE WERE SOME F-101'S AND B-66'S FROM SHAW AFB OPERATING IN
THAT AREA AND DURING THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.
SENIOR DIRECTOR - LT THOMAS M. PRESTON
COMMENTS: POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT OBJECTS WERE F-101'S AND
B-66'S ON TRAINING FLIGHT FROM SHAW. SHAW AFB ADVISED THAT
AIRCRAFT WERE ON TRAINING FLIGHT IN THE AREA ABOUT THAT TIME.
BUSH CORAL ADVISED REGISTERED RADAR SIGHTING. THIS COULD BE
DUE TO THE FACT THAT OBJECTS WERE IN IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF
BUSH CORAL, HENCE IN THEIR GROUND CLUTTER.
