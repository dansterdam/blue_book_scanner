The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a project record card from Project 10073, which documents an unidentified object sighting on May 5, 1964 at coordinates 43.10 N 174 W in the Pacific Ocean. The record card includes details about the sighting, such as the type of observation (Air-Visual), the number of objects observed (one), the course of the object, and the conclusions drawn about the sighting, which indicate that it may have been a satellite in flight, but that satellite schedules were not available to confirm this.
