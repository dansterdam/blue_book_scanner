Near Tucuman, Argentina, a UFO landed in an alfalfa field on December 8th, and was seen by many people, including Cecilio Lopez. The former investigator of the site the morning after, according to Saucer News, described the object as "a silvery craft", and said that in Spanish it is called a "OVNIS", apparently meaning the Spanish word for "unidentified flying object". The object is estimated to be about 40 feet in diameter.

Finally, according to the English-language Buenos Aires Herald of November 5th, a father according to the article, Director of the San Miguel Observatory, has clearly visible UFOs in photographs taken of his little Echo II.
On another occasion recently, he saw a UFO closely following the little Echo II.
