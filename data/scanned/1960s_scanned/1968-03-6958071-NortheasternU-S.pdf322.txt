Dear Dr. Hynek:
With reference to your telephone call this morning, I am sending you a copy of a letter which refers to a report on the sighting of a strange object on the evening of March 30, 1968.
As you will note, the individual who submitted this report requests that his identity be kept confidential. I hope this will be possible. I am also enclosing a copy of the report itself, which gives the details of the sighting.
Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance in this matter. I am greatly interested in your evaluation of this case, and will of course abide by the same in the report mentioned.
Sincerely yours,
