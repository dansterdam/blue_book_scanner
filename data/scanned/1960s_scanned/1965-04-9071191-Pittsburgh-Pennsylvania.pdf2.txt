The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter addressed to "Mrs. [Redacted]" from an organization that seems to be related to the Air Force. The letter discusses a previous communication and provides some information about air-related incidents. The text of the letter has been transcribed below:

Dear Mrs. [Redacted],

Reference is made to your letter of 17 April 1965 concerning a UFO sighting which I understand occurred on 9 April 1965.

The Air Force receives all reports of unidentified flying objects very seriously. It maintains a special project for the investigation of such reports. All reports received are carefully evaluated in an effort to determine the nature of the sighting.

In this case, the preliminary investigation indicates the sighting was probably a weather phenomenon, possibly a meteor or other astronomical occurrence. The extensive investigation and analysis conducted on this case by the Air Force indicates the results of the air Force evaluation.

Based on this, we can assure you that this matter will be held in confidence and no public release of the information will be made.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
