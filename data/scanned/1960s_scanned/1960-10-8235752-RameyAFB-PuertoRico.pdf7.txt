Honorable Harry Bartwright,
House of Representatives,
Dear Sir:

The department of the Army has referred to me a copy of your letter dated 15 February 1950, in which you requested information concerning the recovery of an object near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947.

The Department of the Army has advised this office that all files and records pertaining to the Roswell, New Mexico, incident have been transferred to the custody of the Air Force. However, this office has no information in its files that would indicate the recovery of any object near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947. The files of this office contain no data that would substantiate the reports of the recovery of an unidentified object in that area.

Your request for information has been noted, and should any data come to the attention of this office that would be relevant to your inquiry, you will be promptly advised.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
Captain, U.S. Air Force
