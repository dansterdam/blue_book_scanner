1. It is suggested that the two samples be subjected to a preliminary investigation consisting of (1) a microstructural analysis and, depending on the results obtained, (2) a spectrographic analysis. It is further recommended that the condition of these samples be reported to AFSC along with recommendations, if any, for additional investigation and a cost estimate. 

2. The estimated cost for the performance of the microstructural analysis is $150, and for the spectrographic analysis, $300.

3. Before proceeding with such an examination, PWS will await authorization.
