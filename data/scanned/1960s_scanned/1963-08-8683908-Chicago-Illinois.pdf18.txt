34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 6 Aug, 1963

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

After the proper object had apparently maneuvered overhead, it glanced or angled downward, maintaining a steady course and altitude. It then pulled away rather suddenly and slowly moved off to the northwest, gradually climbing higher. The object was lighted, metallic in appearance and was featureless or entirely smooth. At times it seemed to pulsate or throbb in a manner that was neither uniform nor constant. When first observed, there was no doubt in my mind that the object was extraordinary and wholly unlike any aircraft or missile with which I am familiar. I am completely convinced that the object was not of conventional origin, nor was it caused by any of the celestial bodies nor atmospheric phenomena and that it presents an unexplained mystery which deserves further investigation. At all times, the object, although unusual and perplexing, appeared to be under intelligent control or guidance. My sighting lasted approximately 3-4 minutes. If at any time clarification or elaboration of these comments is required, I would be pleased to assist in whatever manner possible.
