"Diagram 9/21/64
Observation 
On the evening of 9-21-64 this observer was in the backyard at approximately 8 p.m. when he noticed a bright light, appearing to be about 1 mile high and about 1/2 mile away. The light was about the size of a basketball and was glowing with a bluish-white hue. The light appeared to be stationary at first, but then it began to move slowly to the southeast, stopping occasionally and then continuing on its course. This movement continued for about 10 minutes, at which time the light suddenly shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.
The weather was clear at the time of the observation and there were no clouds or other obstructions in the sky. No sound was heard during the observation.
This observer found the incident quite puzzling and can offer no satisfactory explanation for what was observed."
