OBJECT SEEN IN NEW JERSEY
Douglass DeCicco of Meadowbrook, reported a UFO at around 1:30 a.m. when glancing out of his car window. He had parked his car in the driveway upon returning home and was preparing to leave the vehicle, when he noticed a luminous object at an altitude of about 100 feet, hovering gently towards him. A slight rocking motion was observed.
The UFO was of a spherical shape and glowed with a soft blue light. It was estimated to be about 15 feet in diameter. As DeCicco watched, the object seemed to increase in brightness and then suddenly disappeared, leaving no visible protuberances, vents, or jets.
The object came to a halt about 30 feet from DeCicco's car, directly above the roof of a sleeping neighbor's home. It was motionless for about 20 seconds, the only sound being a slight humming. DeCicco had, by now, left his car, and entered his home and alerted his wife. She accompanied him to their yard and reported she observed the object disappearing with great speed.
