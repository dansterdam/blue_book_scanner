Joy
For Space Landing Hoax
The bizzard starting, accompanied by strange sounds, and floodlights for a short time Monday night, apparently was a hoax set up to attract attention. About a dozen cars were parked in the area. Several persons claimed to have seen a "flying saucer" landing, but police found no trace of this, Although the lights and sounds did occur, the explanation appears to be some kind of a prank or hoax.

LURED THOUSANDS
As a result of news stories and reports, hundreds - perhaps even thousands - of local residents flocked to the area in hopes of seeing the "flying saucer."

The boys, with their prank, probably caused an undue amount of excitement and even some fear, as some persons said they "knew it was real." However, the police found no evidence of a landing or of any unusual activity other than the lights and sounds reported.

STRANGE THINGS
Local authorities found some rather strange things. However, they indicated this apparent hoax may have been the work of mischievous youths out for a prank. "They probably did it to see how many people they could bring to the area," he said.

Justice Lawrence Myers then said Coppolino if he had any information regarding the details of the "flying saucer" landing, but Coppolino said he had none since he did not see it.
The Judge then sentenced Coppolino, with the warning that if anything like this happens again, he will be severely dealt with.
