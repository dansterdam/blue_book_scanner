obseration the light remained 
relatively stationary, was not 
blinking, and was of a steady, 
bright white light. The light 
was very bright, nearly as 
bright as the morning star. 
The light gave the appearance 
of being round and of con-
siderable size. No other lights
or objects were observed in the
vicinity.  Weather conditions were
clear and dark. The observers
were certain the light was not
an aircraft, satellite, or other 
known object.  The report was 
made by two people who had 
similar observations. One of the
observers is an office worker
and the other is a member
of the Civil Air Patrol.
