The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, showing a sketch or diagram with compass directions and instructions for observing and documenting the motion of an unidentified object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point where the object was sighted (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "A" on the compass where you feel saw the object.

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
