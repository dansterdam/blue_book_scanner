PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 30 or 31 Jul 67
2. LOCATION: Kernville, California
3. SOURCE: CIVILIAN
10. CONCLUSION: (Conflicting data)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer sighted a yellow light in the sky and seemed about twice as large as the largest visible star. Later sighting showed the light to be moving in a straight line and then made a little course.
Comments: Edwards rapcon was contacted at the time of the sighting. The only thing they painted was a target that was a target that was travelling about 100 knots and was believed to have been a distant airliner. Dr. Hynek stated that it did not appear profitable to pursue the case any further.
