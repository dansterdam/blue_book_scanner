Gentlemen:

I have analyzed the following information from a flight of Bucyrus, Ohio, who tells me she has not informed you of it. I was told of it by my daughter and had I not brought it to your attention I don't know what would happen.

"On September 13th I was taking my daughter home from school and all of a sudden an object came into sight which was brighter than the sun and emitted no heat. It hung there for about 45 seconds and then began to move out of sight in a northeasterly direction very rapidly. It left no trail and made no sound. It was about 6 feet in diameter and rather shaped like a saucer with a small dome on top.

"A little later I saw another object, similar in shape, brightness and action. It was only a small object but did not have the parent and did not leave any trail.

"After a while, I saw a third bright object rising through the outer branches of another tree. This looked to be about 6 feet high and had a ring of lights around the outside. This object moved rapidly across the sky and disappeared.

"All three of these objects were moving higher in the heavens and moving at a high rate of speed. They were very bright and colored and at a 45' angle in the sky and appeared to be about a block and a half away.

"This makes 5 objects that I've seen in the sky this year ago last August."

This report does not seem too reliable and often does occur, but we would like to track the frequency of such reports if possible. We would appreciate hearing from this observer again if she sees any more of these objects.
