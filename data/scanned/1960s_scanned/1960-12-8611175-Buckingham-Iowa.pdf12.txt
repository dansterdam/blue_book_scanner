20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on an "X" on the path, a "Y" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object, and estimate how much of the object is covered by the match head. If this could not be done, how much of the object was covered by the match head?
c-2feet. never less than half match. appeared slightly larger than match head

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes-suddenly here then gone

Star-like but really thin and elongated. very very small. got larger size wise. changed shape going from bright to dim. no sound at all.
