2. Time of Observation: 1700 hours 
3. Location of Observation: Edwards AFB, California
4. How Observed: Visual observation
5. Course Observed: Erratic, hovering, rapid acceleration, high speed
6. Narrative: At approximately 1700 hours on 8 October 1965, while conducting an equipment test on the flightline at Edwards AFB, Calif., I observed an unidentified aerial object. The object appeared to be round or disc-shaped, hovering over the field just west of the equipment test site. After hovering for approximately 10 seconds, the object then accelerated rapidly to the northeast, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. The object appeared to be silvery-white in color and was approximately 25-30 feet in diameter. There were no visible means of propulsion. The weather at the time was clear with light winds.

Rank: Airman First Class
