On 9 March 1967, Captain Robt. C. Cummings and CrJ Henry S. Luchner, 1105th Trans. Co. ( Med Hel ) Iowa ARNG, Davenport Iowa, flew CH-37B 72657 on a combined test flight and aerial photo trip. We started flying in the Davenport local traffic pattern and later flew direct to the vicinity of Muscatine for the purpose of taking aerial photos. Upon completing the photos we returned to the Dam and returned direct to Davenport Airport and landed straight-in on runway 20. Our altitude varied between 1500' to 2000' enroute and below 1000' in the photo area. At no time were we below 500' or interfere with highway /800. We departed the 1105th ramp at 1120 hrs and returned at 1250 hrs.
