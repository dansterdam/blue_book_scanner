11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Our #7 is a positive case of light objects sighted. The objects were brilliant white objects with a halo, and they were sighted off and on for over 15 minutes. The objects appeared to dance or oscillate, and then appeared to suddenly disappear. This appears to be a genuine sighting of a UFO.
