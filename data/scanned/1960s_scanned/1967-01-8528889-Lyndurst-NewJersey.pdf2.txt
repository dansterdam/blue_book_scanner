Dear Sir:

My letter of patience - information referring to OPERATION - BLUE BOOK does not seem to have been satisfactorily handled. About 8 months ago I reported a questionable sighting, and apparently nothing was done. I am concerned for additional info regarding my original report, and have still not received any mind regarding my ideas about the sighting.

Yours truly
