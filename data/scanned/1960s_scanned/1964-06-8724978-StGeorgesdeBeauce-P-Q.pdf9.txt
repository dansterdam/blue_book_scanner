Dear Sir,

I am extremely interested in your article of June, 1954. I sighted one object in Erie, Pennsylvania (as have many others since that time). It was 3:15 p.m., and the sun was shining brightly. The object first looked like a small white cloud, but within a few seconds was a color and size all its own.  It appeared to make an accelerated maneuver, then stop and then move off to the north at a terrific speed. The entire sighting lasted perhaps less than a minute. The object (as may be illustrated on page 8) was vividly golden in color and gave off no noise and no sounds. The jet-like exhaust (see illustration on page 8) appeared to have a white substance following it. There was no visible windows, doors, etc. The four smaller UFOs appeared to be about 1/3 the size of the main object.

I would appreciate it immensely if you could send me any information you can on UFOs. Thank you very much.

Sincerely yours,
