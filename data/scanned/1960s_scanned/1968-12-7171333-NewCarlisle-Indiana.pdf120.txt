There does not appear to be any photograph present on this page of the Project Blue Book document. The page contains detailed photographic data, including the type and make of the camera used, the focal length and type of lens, the brand and type of film, the shutter speed used, the lens opening, filters used, and whether a tripod or solid stand was used. The text also includes additional information about the camera and the observed object.
