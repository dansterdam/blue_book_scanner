SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968 

Between 0945 and 0950 pm EST numerous observers in the Indiana, Ky., Ohio, and West Virginia areas sighted several whitish lights that appeared to have reddish red tails. The majority of the observers stated that there were 3 (three) objects and that they were traveling in a NE direction. The objects were sighted by numerous ground observers and also by several aircraft pilots. Indianapolis ground observers stated that the objects were blinking but did not emit any objects that could be correlated to the UFOs. The Space Detection Center reported that they were quite certain that the sighting was the result of the decay or Space debris into the earth's atmosphere.
