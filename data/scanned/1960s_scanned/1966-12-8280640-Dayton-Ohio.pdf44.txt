The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image contains a diagram with instructions for the observer, including directions on how to indicate the path and changes in direction of the observed object(s). The instructions also ask the observer to draw a picture showing how multiple objects were arranged and the direction they were traveling.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the sketch to show the direction you first saw the object. Draw an arrow to show the path that the object followed. Place a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

28. Draw to show that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
ONLY 1 OBJECT
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
