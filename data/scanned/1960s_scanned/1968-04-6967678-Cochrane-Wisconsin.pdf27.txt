To:	Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Lt. Colonel

I cannot agree that all pertinent data has been gathered. For example, the comments of the preparing officer stated that "the moon was in its quarter phase that night and moonrise was approximately 2000 hours local time". Moonrise on that day was approximately noon (1) and moonset was just about midnight. Therefore, at the time of sighting, approximately 2015, the moon was still fairly high in the sky. It was not in its first quarter and could not have been mistaken for the object being observed, the bearing of which was approximately 15 degrees toward the northeast. 

Evaluation of this sighting depends largely, as I see it, on the reliability of the conditions under which her observation was made. This point is similar to that reported in many other cases happened. I feel it would be eminently worthwhile to obtain Miss Lichtle's testimony by telephone, and to send you a transcript, so that we can collectively make some judgement as to her objectivity and reliability.

I fail to understand how the preparing officer could have been so fillpreparedly.
