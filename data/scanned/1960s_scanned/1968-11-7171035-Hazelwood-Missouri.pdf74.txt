WHAT TO DO

If a UFO sight is observed, a careful record should be made of the time, duration, direction, size, shape, color, speed, altitude, and direction of movement, as well as any unusual characteristics of the object or phenomena. If possible, the UFO should be sketched or photographed. The observer should avoid making any sudden movements which might cause the object to alter its flight or disappear. If the UFO seems to be approaching the observer, the best action is to remain calm and continue the observation, recording as much detail as possible. Inform the nearest Air Force base immediately if the object is thought to be of a hostile nature.
