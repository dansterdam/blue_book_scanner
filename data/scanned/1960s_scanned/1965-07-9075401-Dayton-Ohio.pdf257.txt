FLYING SAUCERS ASSOCIATED WITH OF SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAY
HENRY RUICK 
WRITER
UFO'S SOME PEOPLE WEAR 
THE WING.
ONE FLYING SAUCER MOVING OVER ANTARCTICA TO ENGLAND CAME REPORTS OF MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBIECTS APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING WITH ELECTROMAGNETIC EQUIPMENT. 
MANY ON BOARD THIS CRAFT CLAIMED CONTACT WITH LIFE INSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST,
BUT NO GLOWING OBIECT THAT CAUSED COMMOTION FROM OHIO TO MARYLAND AND GLANCING HAVE BALLOONIST CLAIMS. 
THE AIR FORCE WHICH HAS LOOKED INTO OVER 12,000 REPORTED SIGHTINGS CANNOT TELL US FOR CERTAIN WHICH HAS BEEN CAUSED BY HALLUCI NATING PEOPLE OR ACTUAL PHEMOMENA.
THE RED AND WHITE KITE SENT UP BY YOUR NEIGHBOR CHILD 
TO PLAY WHICH HAS LOOKED LIKE A DISC IS AN EXAMPLE.
CASE DU/BOIS TOWN COUNCIL SAID ONLY 667 REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED OUT OF OVER 12,000 
WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO INVESTIGATORS AND MORE INFO ON SIGHTINGS WOULD BE EVEN GREATER IF ALL CASES WERE SO THOROUGHLY CHECKED.
ABSOLUTELY FOREVIDANCE IS INDICATIVE OF HAVING SOME RETIRED MARINE PILOT WHO IS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INVESTI GATION IS DIRECTOR ON ANALYZING PHENOMENA.
E ASE
THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS IS THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE FROM SOME KIND OF EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT
LONG AGO I BUT HAS ANOTHER LEVEL POLICY OF EXPLAINING THE SIGHTING
RATHER THAN AGGRESSION. THE VERY FRIGHTENING ASPECT 
HOWEVER,
IS THAT ARMY ENGINEERS ENGLAND IN VALENGOLESPE FRANCE MAURICE MASSE SAID
HE WAS VERY FRIGHTENED HIS EXPERT OBJECT WITH OCCUPANTS ON JULY 
THAT THEY DON'T THINK THAT THESE ARE SOVIET OR AMERICAN AIRCRAFT. 
WITH THE OFFICIAL LESSON MILE NEITHER DO THEY THINK THAT THEY ARE FROM THIS EARTH.
WHEN APPROACHED DIRECTLY, THESE STRANGE OBJECTS APPARENTLY SOMETIMES CHANGE TO GREEN LENSE SHAPED OBJECTS YELLOW RED CHANGING DESIGN, MANEUVER, AND DISAPPEAR. 
SEEM: THE VILLA DO PORTO EITHER SAUCER OR A DISK SUCH IN THE
AZORES IT WOULD NOT BE JUST ANOTHER JOB. 
AROUND THE GLOBE ON JULY 15. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS SAID THESE SIGHTINGS COULD NOT BE FROM ANY COUNTRY ON THIS EARTH. 
VISIBLE FOR 40 MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED WHEN AN AIR FORCE
JET WAS WITHIN 10 MILES OF IT. ANOTHER SIGHTING OVER WEYMOUTH, MASSACHUSETTS 
WAS REPORTED THE LAST NIGHT AS SAUCER SHAPED OBJECTS IN THE SKY MOVED ERRATICALLY FOR 10 MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED.
FOUND LIKE A FLYING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE.
