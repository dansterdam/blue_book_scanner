WASHING1UN, D. C.

DEAR SIRS:

I would like to report to you a UFO. The object wds seen on
March 11, 1967 at 8:15 p.m. in Cill City, Pennsylvania. 
It was a round, white object and it would appear and disappear
periodically. It was very bright and moved very fast to the northeast. 
I am a Presburn at Venango General Huspital and
witnessed this occurrence at about 8:15 p.m. on March 11, 1967.
As I mentioned, the object was round, white in color, and it
would appear and disappear periodically in the sky. It was
very bright and moved very fast to the northeast.
I want the above information to be recorded.

As I mentioned, I am a Presburn at Venango General Hospital
and I could see the object clearly. I would like to know what
you think this object could be. I have never seen anything
like it before.
