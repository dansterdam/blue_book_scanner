WALLOPS LAUNCHES SIX
EXPERIMENTS OVERNIGHT

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration conducted six experiments between sunset and dawn last night from its Wallops Island, Va., Station.

Five of the payloads were chemical cloud experiments launched at 5:39 p.m., 7:32 p.m., 9:00 p.m., 12:12 a.m. and 6:31 a.m. EST.  The twilight and dawn firings were sodium vapor experiments which generated reddish-orange clouds visible for hundreds of miles along the East Coast.  The other three payloads consisted of trimethylaluminum (TMA) vapor trails which formed blue-green clouds high above the earth.  The payloads were flown on Nike-Apache research rockets and the vapor trails were ejected at altitude ranges of about 30 to 120 statute miles.

Purpose of these experiments was to measure wind velocities and directions at various altitudes in the upper atmosphere.  Data on wind conditions are obtained by photographing the clouds.
