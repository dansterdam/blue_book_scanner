Mr. Antonio L. Texas
San Antonio 1, Texas

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Thank you for your letter of 24 August, which was referred to us by Harvard Observatory.

We have not been able to determine the nature of your sighting, and the photograph forwarding is unsatisfactory.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center, ATIC) Project Blue Book, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, would be the proper agency to handle any further correspondence regarding this matter.

Any reports received should be sent directly to them.

We can get star charts, etc., each by writing to:

Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
Harvard College Observatory
Cambridge 38, Massachusetts

Thank you for your time and interest.

Respectfully,

[Signature]
Martin W. McGeath
