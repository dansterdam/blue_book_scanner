It was described as round in shape, having a red-orange color and varying slightly in intensity. After observing the light for some time, it disappeared rapidly making a downward motion. The apparent size of the light was about the same as a landing light on an aircraft. No sound was heard. The witness and his family were returning to Fargo, N. Dak. from Detroit Lakes, Minn. after visiting friends there. His report would also be forwarded to the Minn. Dept. of Aeronautics.
