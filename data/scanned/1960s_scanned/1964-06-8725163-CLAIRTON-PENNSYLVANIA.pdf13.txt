TEXT OUTPUT:
PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT
LOCATION: CLAIRTON, PENNSYLVANIA	DATE: 28 JUN 64
PHOTOGRAPHY:
AF   One negative and 2 prints

1. PURPOSE: This report analyses the photographic work done under Number 68-29 by Major Quintin performed on behalf of the UFO Photographic Evaluation Project. Analysis was conducted by the Photo Analysis Division (PDAD).

2. ANALYSIS: Extremely poor processing resulted in numerous markings on the film. Prints were heavily overexposed and processed, resulting in loss of contrast and detail. The photographic qualities of the image were generally poor, passaing on poor quality image for interpretation.

3. In the absence of a definite object on the negative and print, and the extreme poor qualities of the images, determination of the nature of the image could not be made. The object is dark area across the bottom of the frame could possibly be earth or horizon. The odd shape of the image could be caused if the window condition at the time of exposure were unsatisfactory.
