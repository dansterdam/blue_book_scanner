The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

Project Bluebook
8722561 January 8, 1965

The event in question does not seem to be the kind, however, to warrant a full investigation by special project.

We would suggest that the incident be handled at the local level, with no special action by this headquarters. Should any further significant information be obtained, we would be interested in receiving it.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
