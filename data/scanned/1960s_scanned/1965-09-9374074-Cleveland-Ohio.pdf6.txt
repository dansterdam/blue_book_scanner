The object was a light silvery object that hovered at about 500 feet above the ground. The object maneuvered toward me at a distance of about 150 feet before reversing and maintaining a constant position. The object had no exhaust or contrails. It had no landing lights or visible cockpit or windows and was shaped like a flat ellipsoid. Suddenly, a large halo of light appeared to come from the object, illuminating the surrounding area. This light was very bright and steady, not blinking or pulsing. It remained illuminated for about a minute before it went dark again. The object then started ascending slowly and climbed out of sight below the treeline. The night was dark with some light haze and the object was clearly visible against the sky. The movement was smooth and silent, not like any known aircraft. The time of the sighting was approximately 9:30 pm.
