Text extracted from the document:

Dear Sir,
My name is [redacted] am [redacted] years old. On [redacted] I and my family were visiting at [redacted] and at approximately [redacted] my attention was drawn to a very bright light in the northwest section of the sky. This light moved in a circular manner, stop and start, and then a sudden burst of speed in various directions. After it had remained in view for approximately [redacted] minutes, it suddenly disappeared. I saw a similar object on [redacted] and on [redacted] with my sister and brother-in-law at [redacted]. They also observed the same type of light. I am firmly convinced that what we saw was not an airplane, satellite, or any other known object. I am a member of C.C.U.R. (Chicago Civilian Observation of Astronomical Phenomena) which was organized to get prompt reporting and on-the-spot observation of UFO's and am having a great deal of trouble convincing others of what I saw. We would appreciate any information you could give us regarding this incident. Over
