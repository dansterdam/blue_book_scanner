There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text.

The text in the document says:

54. Date you completed this questionnaire. 
3 Day 8 Month 1967 Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire.

The text describes a sighting of something that suddenly took off like a streak and disappeared. The witness was unsure of what they saw, but it seemed to move in an unusual way. The text also mentions the witness consulting various technical experts and scientists about the incident.
