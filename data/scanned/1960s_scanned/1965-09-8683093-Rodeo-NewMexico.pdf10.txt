Text from the document:

RODEO, NEW MEXICO
25 SEPTEMBER 1965

At approximately 6:00 P.M., 25 September 1965, two objects first appeared near the horizon. It could not be determined if these objects were attached to a mother craft or if they were independent vehicles. The objects were apparently moving westward on an interesting course with the observer's north bound automobile. The observer maintained a constant speed of about 40-45 mph. The objects paced the automobile while driving across the desert, but as the objects approached the observer, they slowed to a speed slightly slower than the observer's vehicle. The objects appeared to be at an angular separation of 15-20 degrees and still in line astern formation. They remained in this tight formation of about 50 feet for several minutes. The objects then increased speed and within a few seconds appeared to be at an angular separation of 15-45 degrees and still in line. After approximately three minutes from the time the objects began to drop, the observer stated they regained formation and the other maneuver.

COMMENTS:
One possible explanation could be that of two helicopters; however, no sound at all, even with the car window open. A check was made and there were no aircraft in the area at the time of the observation. The motion of the objects and the maneuvers performed are not characteristic of conventional aircraft or ground lights. As such, the case remains unidentified since no physical evidence is available that can offer an explanation.
