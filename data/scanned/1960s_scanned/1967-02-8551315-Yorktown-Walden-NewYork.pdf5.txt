The shared image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, but there is no photograph present on this particular page. The text on the page describes the location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of an air traffic or balloon release, as well as the position, title, and comments of the preparing officer, Capt. Stephen Levine.

The text found in the document is as follows:

1. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting:
F-101 traffic pattern attitude, how pass with air observer's lit-

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
Capt. Stephen Levine, Capt. Pilot/Navigator. At approximately 2300 I observed an F-101 making a low pass over runway 27. He lit his after burners and turned right out of traffic with his burners lit and at a low altitude until out of sight. This flight path would have taken him over the observed directions and at the approximate time of their sightings. Their descriptions match my observations perfectly.

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs: 
None
