Transcribed text from the document:

ANALYSIS OF CASES ON OR AFTER 21 OCTOBER
In no case was there any evidence of influence due to mental aberrations. The witnesses generally gave good descriptions of the subjective appearance of what they saw; only in two cases were there any signs that the story was being embellished, and in even those the basic observations seemed correct.
The principal factor which led to a UFO report in every case to be failure to recognize what was being seen as something normal. Many witnesses described stars as "starlike," and satellites and airplanes as "like a satellite" or "like an airplane". However, they noticed something unusual, such as color changes, brightness, motions, which to them ruled out the first impression. It is entirely probable that if the witnesses had not heard that UFO's were being seen, they would have accepted the unusual aspects as normal. What was influenced by publicity was not observation, but interpretation.
