35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in this specific questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

We were watching fireworks, which was to our East, not 3/4 of a mile away. The UFO was hovering, and seemed to be moving in a reversed direction as it picked up speed, then assuming a saucer-like shape, it seemed to go straight up. It was very large, and was yellow or orange. We saw a row of red lights at the perimeter. The sky was clear, and somewhat lit up from the fireworks. The UFO was about a mile away, at treetop level. But its size and pattern of flight would suggest that it was not a conventional craft.
