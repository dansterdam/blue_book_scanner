The image appears to be an aerial photograph of a snowy landscape. The photograph does not contain any human faces, so I will not identify or name any individuals. The image shows a forested area with a number of circular impact sites marked with "X" and labeled with various distances. At the bottom of the image, there is a caption that states "X PT OF IMPACTS OVERALL DISTANCE: 120 YARDS".
