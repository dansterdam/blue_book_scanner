Dear Sirs,

I am enclosing a disclosure report regarding a possible sighting of a UFO. On the night of September 16, 1961, at approximately 10:00 pm, [redacted] and I were driving on the [redacted] highway when I noticed what appeared to be a metallic, disc-shaped object hovering at an estimated altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet. The object seemed to be stationary for several minutes, then accelerated sharply and departed the area at a very high rate of speed.

[The rest of the text is handwritten and difficult to fully decipher, but appears to continue describing the UFO sighting and the witness's observations.]
