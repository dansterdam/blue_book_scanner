LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Intelligent Beings Flew
UFOs Sighted Over Valley

I am 29 years of age, of average intelligence, not superstitious, nor do I have hallucinations. For the past 10 years I have kept silent, like many others, for fear of being considered a nut, or depredating my position. But the time is coming that we must realize the fact that there are intelligent beings from an unknown planet using these UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects). 

How can we verify the fact that intelligent beings are controlling and using these UFOs unless the public starts telling what they are seeing and experiencing? Natural phenomena, such as meteors? 

Letters submitted for publication in this column must bear the full name and address of the writer. All letters are subject to condensation:

When does a meteor fly a horizontal plane? What about its glowing green tail?

My vision is 20-20. I'm an Air Force trained in summary quick identification, and a retired aircraft specialist with 20 years of aircraft experience. There believe that I see lights wasan't all meteors. These lights, glowing, green-ish-blue objects on a northwest heading over Wright-Patterson Air Base, at a high rate of speed, were sighted by me while eating supper.

I have sighted four UFOs in the past 10 years; two in this area, and two in the San Antonio, Tex., area. I have additional information; if told, the world-minded people would probably consider me a screwball. I'll leave well enough alone.

Would like to hear from others who have had strange experiences in order to compare information.
