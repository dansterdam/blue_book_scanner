May name is [REDACTED] and I have been told that it has the most interesting mission and the lives of the Williamson and Mr. Williamsson(?) mission. When I seen this object device my first personal experience was that this object parked on the surface near to the field and then it [ILLEGIBLE] and seem almost to leave from the surface.

It appeared to be a very big object, shaped something like a top, and seem to have its brilliancy or light on the bottom, as the usual [ILLEGIBLE] I have read about. When it seemed to be ready to leave the surface, it first go straight up very fast and then proceeded to move away or disappear. I have to admitted that I was greatly impressed at what I seen at the time, and I have mentioned this occurrence to a number of people, but I did not feel that I will not be able to give any acceptable evidence or proof to the authorities, so I decided to write direct to you in hope that this report may be of some interest or value to your investigation.
