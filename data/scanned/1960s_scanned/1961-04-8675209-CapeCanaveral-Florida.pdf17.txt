RADAR TARGETS: U-2 POSITION 295 DEGREES 173 MILES.
NEGATIVE THROUGH THE 1025 DEGREES RADAR.
PART FIVE: DISCUSSION OF THEORY I - U-2 AIRCRAFT. AT APPROX 1700Z, 9 MAY, A TEST WAS RUN BY AFHTC USING A U-2 AIRCRAFT.
THIS AIRCRAFT FLEW ABOVE A RADAR GROUND CONTROL AT A HEADING OF 120 DEGREES AT AN ALTITUDE OF 55,000 FEET AND PROCEEDED 230-273 MILES DOWN RANGE.
WHEN IT APPROACHED THE 220 MILE POINT, A SOFT RETURN APPEARED ON THE SCOPE BUT SOON DIED OUT.
THE U-2 LEVELED OFF AT 50 MILES FROM THE CAPE. AT THIS POINT, THE SCOPE SHOWED A HARD TARGET AT ABOUT 220 MILES, BUT THERE IS NO RECORD OF THIS TARGET BEING IDENTIFIED.
IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE U-2 TURN WAS UP OR DOWN AND OFF THE STRENGTH OF THE RADAR.
THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT EACH TIME THE U-2 TURNED, THE PAINT DISAPPEARED. A CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF THE U-2 POSITION PLOTTED BY CAPE RADAR AND THE POSSIBLE REFLECTIONS ON THE FPS-16 RADAR WERE MADE.
RADAR WHILE ALL TIMES EXCEPT 220 NAUTICAL MILES APART.
