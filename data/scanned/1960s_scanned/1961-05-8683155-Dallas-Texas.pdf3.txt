As was apparent from a 
(name deleted) of the report, this
very unusual occurrence. It was
a disc-like object which ap
peared for about 30 seconds 
to be hovering over the city 
of of Dallas. It then suddenly 
appeared to accelerate at a 
high rate of speed and fly 
out of sight in a southerly
direction. The object was de
scribed as being about 30 feet 
in diameter, very bright and 
luminous. It was seen by a 
number of reliable witnesses 
among them an airline pilot
and several police officers.
This report has been for
warded to the Aerial Phenomena 
Group at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base, Ohio, for evaluation.
Other reports of similar in
cidents have also been for
warded to that agency. It is
believed that the Air Force
will conduct a thorough in
vestigation of this matter.
