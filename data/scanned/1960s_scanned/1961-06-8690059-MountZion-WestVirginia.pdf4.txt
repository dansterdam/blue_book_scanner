Dear Sir:

About four years ago in November, 1957, there occurred a sighting of a "metallic object" by several civilian witnesses in the Mount Zion, West Virginia area. 

On Friday, June 9, 1961, a friend of mine who lives about 12 miles from Mount Zion called to inform me that a copy of a letter dated June, 1961, had come into his possession. This letter described the object witnessed in November, 1957 as being about one mile in diameter, circular in shape, and making a high-pitched whining sound. The object was observed for a long time and maneuvered around slowly and erratically in hopes of landing. 

I would greatly appreciate any information about these incidents. As to the reasons for my interest, I am currently completing a study on certain aspects of the UFO phenomenon, and more particularly, the November, 1957 sighting in the Mount Zion, West Virginia area.

Again, your considerations and any additional information you would be able to provide would be appreciated. 

By avoiding your reply, thanking you, I remain

Mount Zion, West Virginia
