The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document, specifically Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 12 April 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
Dusk and I were discussing when suddenly we saw an object, apparently twenty minutes later we saw it again. The conversation took place with one or two other persons. It was what we would call a night light and would move somewhat, and appear and disappear, and would at times permit a closer view. Attempts were made to find out more by telephone calls, but were unsuccessful.
From this I think the USAF can have as complete an investigation as may be possible. Otherwise why not and which may be satisfactory in this case, and may be warranted in other visits to this area. That is about all there is to be said, that is the way it was.
