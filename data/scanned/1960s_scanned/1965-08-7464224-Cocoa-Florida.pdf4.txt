Hello, Mr. Moore. This is Professor Hynek at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.

Yes, sir.

I'm a consultant for the Air Force on the matter of Unidentified Flying Objects. And it has been a long while since we have been through these reports, but the report officially made from the Patrick Air Force Base, went to the Pentagon, then it went to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and finally I got it.

We are still trying to track down -- around the 4th of August there were an awful lot of sightings all over the country. 

Yes, I understand that.

We are still trying to pin down what some of these were. A great many of them were stars and balloons. But some of these are very puzzling, and the one that you and Mrs. Schilde 

Schilde, is it? That's right. And Mr. Ivy and Mr. Scott reported. I'm not sure they were the same thing, either. But you and Schilde were together, I believe. And Ivy and Scott were.

That's right.

It's a very puzzling thing. I wonder if you wouldn't mind to get a little - if you would like to ask a few questions.

All right.

If you want the spelling of my name -- it's H Y N E K. And the initials are J. A. Hynek. 

I'd like to. My name is J. A. Hynek. From time to time the Air Force over the past number of years has called upon me to assist in the evaluation of these reports.
