Dear Sir:
This is to advise you that, to date, no report of any kind has come to the
attention of this office concerning the apparent UFO observation occurring
near Ravenna, Ohio, on or about 22 August 1964. If any information pertaining
to this incident has been forwarded to your office by the United States Air
Force, I would very much appreciate being advised of the details in order that
our files may be properly documented. It is my understanding that Project Blue
Book was to conduct an investigation of the case, and I would be interested
in learning the results of any such inquiry.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. If I can be of any further
assistance, please do not hesitate to call on me.
Sincerely yours,
[ILLEGIBLE]
