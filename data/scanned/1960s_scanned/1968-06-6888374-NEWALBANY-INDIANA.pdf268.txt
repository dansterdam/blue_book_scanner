The image appears to contain a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The page includes a diagram with a curved trajectory path and a compass-like diagram. There are also instructions for the observer to draw a picture showing the motion and direction of the observed object or objects.

Text from the document:
27. To this indicating device, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon. Place an "B" on the curved line to show how low the object came. If the object made any other significant changes in altitude while you observed it, place additional letter designations to show these changes.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. 

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
