'Cakes Were Just Like Cardboard'
EAGLE RIVER, WIS. --(UPI)-- "Just like cardboard" was Joe Simonton's answer Monday when asked about the taste of three cakes he said were left with him by the silent occupants of a flying craft that landed in his back yard.
The three pancake-like discs are being analyzed in Washington by the National Committee for the Investigation of Aerial Phenomena.
The committee expected to have a report ready by Friday or Monday, Simonton, 58, said he filled a water jug for the "visitor" in his yard last Tuesday, and received the cakes in return. He said he kept them until Saturday, however, because of possible skeptical reactions.
He said the cakes appeared to have the consistency of corn meal. Another man who tried them said they tasted like corn meal.
Dr. Frank Carter, known as a saucer enthusiast, and Carter sent them to Washington.
