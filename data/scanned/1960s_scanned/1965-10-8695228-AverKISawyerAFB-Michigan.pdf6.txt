MR. JACK SAWYER, CAPTAIN, USCG
WHILE RETURNING TO HIS BASE AT TRAVERSE CITY, MICHIGAN SIGHTED A PORTION OF THE OBJECT APPROXIMATELY 5-6 MILES NORTH OF TRAVERSE CITY ABOUT 2000 FT. ALTITUDE. IT WAS CIRCULAR, WHITE IN COLOR AND THERE APPEARED TO BE LIGHTS ON IT.

AFTER OBSERVING THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 MINUTES, IT SEEMED TO FADE OUT IN THE CLOUD MASS. NO SOUND WAS NOTICED UNTIL THE LIGHT FADED.

THE ONLY OTHER STATEMENT FROM THE OBSERVER WAS THAT "WHILE LOOKING AT THE OBJECT HIS EYES BECAME BLURRED."
