The image contains a sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The diagram appears to show two elliptical shapes with arrows pointing in different directions. There is also handwritten text at the bottom of the image that reads "It would cover the match head."

Proceeding to extract the text from the document:

If a picture will show the shape of the engine or propulsion, and indicate the exhaust or vapor trail, indicate by an arrow the direction the picture was moved.

(Sketch)

It would cover the match head.
