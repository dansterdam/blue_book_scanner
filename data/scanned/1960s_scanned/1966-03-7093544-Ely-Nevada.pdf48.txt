Transcribing the text:

My single experience to account
for this event was that I was able to make
out the single outline that seemed steady
and clearly defined against the dark sky for
perhaps 10 to 15 seconds. I have no other
physical evidence to base this on. The
unusual size, speed and maneuver of the
object would suggest that it was an
advanced type of aircraft. However, I can
report no other corroborating sightings or
physical evidence to support my conclusion.
The ground search revealed no traces or
wreckage and no other reports were received
from other observers. I can only conclude that
the object I observed was some type of
advanced aircraft or vehicle of unknown origin.
While unexplained, I have no basis for
assuming it was an extraterrestrial visitation.
I simply do not have enough information to
categorize it further. Should additional data
become available, I would be interested in
learning more. To date, I can only report
my single sighting as described.
