The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

k. Comments of the preparing officers:
(1) The two boys who reported sighting the UFO appeared to be reliable. Their estimates of the distance from the object (approximately 2000') and its size (approximately 200') are inconsistent with the evidence of the photographs. I talked with the lieutenant and they have to offer is incorporated in this report. The two boys, of course, have no scientific background.
(2) An inspection of the scene of the sighting indicated that the surface below the approximate point of the first sighting did not reveal any burns or disturbance of any kind. Generally, the ground was dry and snow covered, with substantial areas of plowed and frozen earth exposed. No craters or depressions of any kind were located, nor was there any evidence on the map. The most noticeable characteristics of the field were the telephone and high tension wires surrounding it. (See attached map.)
(3) We have no information that any aerial test, experimental aircraft, rocket, or missile was near Fargo at the time of the sighting.
(4) Although our information indicates that no aircraft account for this sighting, I feel it should be noted that Hector Airport line approximately due north of this field, and it is quite possible that the photographs were taken in that direction as conventional air traffic approached or departed from the airport.
(5) Also enclosed is a Fargo Police Department Report, which reached this office 15 Mar 67, concerning an object sighted on the same date, 25 Feb 67, at 6:55 p.m.
(6) Physical evidence report pursuant to paragraph 12, AFR 80-17.
