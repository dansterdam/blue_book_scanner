"Lexington, Kentucky
Jan 12, 1961

It seems this my Concern,
On the evening of Jan 8, 1961, 
some friends and myself were 
claiming to see an unusual, 
strange object in the distance. it was
white and had several small white 
flashing lights on it. that we were more
observing a jet trail, we
stop and watched the object
for about 20 minutes. the object
did not get smaller as an airlane
but remained the same height.
After 10 mins it started turrn
Perpendicular and went behind some trees.
That portion we coud not see.
when we got to the place
where we lost it, it was gone.
we lost it there."
