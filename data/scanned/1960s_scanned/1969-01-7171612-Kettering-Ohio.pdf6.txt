The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. 

The text from the document is as follows:

DID THE PHENOMENON

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME? 
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUSH AWAY?
CHANGE DIRECTION AND EXPLODE?
MAKE A SOUND?
CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS? 
CHANGE IN SIZE? 
TRAIL SMOKE OR VAPOR? 
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN, LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?

[Handwritten text]
It was a brilliant object, hesitant and not direct.

A. HAS IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

Doesn't know.

B. DID THE THOMPSON MOVE BEING OR LIE IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
