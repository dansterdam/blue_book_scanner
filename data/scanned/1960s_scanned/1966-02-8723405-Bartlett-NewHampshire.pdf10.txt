It occurred at a small airport and the duration was one half minute. There were other potential witnesses. Since it occurred right on December 26, it is probable that there were no visitors as witnesses.
15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California.
One person's duration of sighting was only 15 seconds. Witness was a 67 year old lady. Sighting occurred at 9p.m. and still have been reasonably bright. Witness said sighting occurred at night and very brief. Perhaps some thinks that anything after 6 p.m. is night. Must be listed as unknown (unger sighting witnesses).
16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire.
I have in my files for 26 February 1966, Manchester, New Hampshire, it does seem to find a Bartlett, New Hampshire case.
17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.
Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit Dayton.
18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.
Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Dover Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case, all I have is the NICAP report. Evaluation pending my getting a report, the sighting is obviously unidentified.
19. 12 February 1967, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
I have a more complete report from it there seems to be a possibility that this one-witness case was caused by low-flying birds reflecting light. The sighting lasted 4 to 70 seconds, and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.
20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Loco, Texas.
I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it a matter of record.
