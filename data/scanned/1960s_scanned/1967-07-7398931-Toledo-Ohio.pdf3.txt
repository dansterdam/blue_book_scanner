Dear Sirs,

The evening of July 31, 1967, at approx. 9:55 P.M. was a clear night and I was just finishing setting up my small 234 power telescope object in the western sky. She had first thought it Venus but then we realized that we had a very bright starlike object in the western sky. She had first thought it Venus but then we realized that we had a very bright starlike object in the western sky.

At first it was hard to focus as the object began to slowly move in a south westerly direction. The object was approx. 40 degrees from the horizon and approx. 45 degrees from the point where the sun had set. The object seemed to be about the size of a star and was bright across the eyepiece. After about three minutes time I was in focus. At first, though, I wasn't in focus, but then the scope in view multiple lights on the object. I tried to pass the eyepiece, and I did this several times, each time trying to look for some small detail I hadn't previously seen.

At this instant approx. 10:00 P.M. (to the unaided eye), a spark like light appeared to fall from the object and then a second light seemed to jumb out like sparks from a roman candle flare. Each light being visible for only three or four seconds. my telescope found and defined these lights by my unaided eye. She is not familiar with the telescope though once I found the object she did see the lights at all times with her eyes. She is not familiar with the telescope. She did not react on the object when I say the lights as I feel, strictly vital so I could remember any and every detail that could be seen.
