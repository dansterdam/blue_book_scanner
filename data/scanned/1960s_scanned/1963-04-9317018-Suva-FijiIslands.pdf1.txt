10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Subject occurred while routine ground radar station was operational. An air intercept radar operator checked the target, confirming it was no known aircraft while in visual range. The object displayed erratic flight path - speed approached estimated 800-900 mph or more at times. Disappeared and reappeared sporadically, sometimes with great speed, but did not seem to approach or withdraw from the radar station at any point. Although object appeared very bright in the bright sunlight, it produced no noise or exhaust trail and showed no evidence of propulsion system. Suspected to be some sort of very high performance unconventional air vehicle. Exact nature and origin unknown.
