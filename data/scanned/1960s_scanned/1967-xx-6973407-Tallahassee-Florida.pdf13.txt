There is no photograph in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

a small white cloud which passed in front of me.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

I cannot recall exactly what common and usual thing it was.

B.  DID IT GIVE ANY INDICATION OF BEING UNDER SOME FORM OF INTELLIGENT CONTROL, WAVE, BLINK, OR IN ANY WAY APPEAR AS THOUGH A "RESPONSE" TO YOUR OBSERVANCE OF IT?
