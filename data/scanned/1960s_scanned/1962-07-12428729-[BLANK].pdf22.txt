The image does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

Cited. I also could not overlook your language on page three: "The chief concern of USAF board members, and public, is the increasing secrecy dangers - NOT, at this time, final conclusions about the
UFO's." (Underscored). It has been noticed in some of the reports of NICAP. I was erroneously led to believe you had factual evidence of some kind about UFO's.

If I have anything to say about it, your terms, conditions and suggestions will not be accepted.

Very truly yours,
