STATEMENT

On 29 July 1965 at 2030 hours CST, my wife and I were bicycling on the north perimeter of Carswell AFB, Texas, when my wife called my attention to two bright, pulsating lights which she spotted coming from the south. We observed these bright lights pulsating on and off as they approached directly overhead at a constant speed, altitude, and direction. 

The object moved at a constant speed, altitude, and direction over the area for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. At first, the object appeared to be two separate objects, but as it moved closer, it became one large object. This large object was about the size of a baseball bat, speaking on the leading edge. The object moved away at a constant rate towards the east and seemed to increase in altitude. At this point it became difficult to see, and it pulsed away a single pulsating light until it became invisible. 

At no time was there any sound--not even the sound a gliding plane could make under normal circumstances. The only audible sound in the area at the time was a distant radio playing.

Estimating the object's size from our distance was difficult, but we would estimate the object's speed at 50 to 60 knots. If the object was a C-141 aircraft being loaded or unloaded on the compass rose a few hundred yards south of our position, there would be no doubt in my mind, but the object was quite strange and baffling.  

Upon returning to my quarters, I called the control tower. The sighting was verified by three other persons on duty, including the Sgt.

THIS STATEMENT IS TRUE AND CORRECT.
