Sighted at 0515 z, one bright light, it was observed by a Tech. Sergeant Powers and Airman 1st Class Anderson from the base weather station. At first it was approximately 10 degrees above the horizon, Southeast of Cheyenne. Then moved roughly northwest until it was directly overhead of Cheyenne. No sound or propulsion and it was the approximate size of a half dollar. Bigger than a pea, huh? Yea. Weather was clear, visibility good. It was observed for approximately 5 minutes. OK. And when it moved northwest the speed was very rapid and the color of it was reddish orange. OK That's it.
