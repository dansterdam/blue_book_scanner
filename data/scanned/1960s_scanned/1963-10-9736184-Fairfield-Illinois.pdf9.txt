PRELIMINARY REPORT OF DR. HENRY'S OBJECT

The following remarks are based on conversations with members of the Geology Department. Greater detail would require removal of a portion of the object for microscopic study.

This is a clay-ironstone concretion, with an outer rim of marcasite (FeS2) and an interior probably of argillaceous siderite (FeCO3). This concretion probably splits along the original bedding of the host rock.

It is definitely a terrestrial object. Concretions of this sort are common in the Pennsylvania strata of Illinois.
