This aircraft is the largest I have ever seen. It was brightly lit, with an almost circular shape, like a huge disc or saucer. It seemed to be slowly heading northward at a very low altitude, around 300 feet or less, almost silently except for a slight hum. The object was observed for about 60 seconds before it disappeared from sight behind trees. The size of the object was estimated to be around 100 feet in diameter.
