The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire-style form with questions about the observed UFO phenomenon.

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

[Handwritten response]
A large object approximately the size of a football field passed over my house traveling at a high rate of speed at approx. 2:00 am. It appeared to have no sound and was brightly lit up. I have never seen anything like it before. It was only in view for approximately 20 seconds then disappeared over the horizon.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

[Handwritten response]
Cant recall if it went behind anything, as it just disappeared suddenly over the horizon.
