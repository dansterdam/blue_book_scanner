Unfortunately, there is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Here is the text from the document, as produced by an OCR system:

Here are some other factors about the situation that are strange to me:
(1) If the white spot is the result of lack of development of the emulsion for the negative, this spot is, as I have noted on the negative, almost round. This suggests to me that it is not due to lack of development but is a distinct object.
(2) Instead of being clearly defined around the edges, as one would expect in the photograph of an object, this spot is blurred around the edges, as might be expected in the photograph of a flying object.
(3) I have taken and developed thousands of pictures, and I have never seen anything like this before. The way this object appears was so completely different from anything I have ever seen in an aerial photograph, that I am inclined to think that it is apparently not a normal aerial photograph.
Of course, this still leaves much to be determined, but because of the factors shown in this picture I am submitting this print for your opinion. If you would like to see the negative, I will be glad to send it to you. Will you please let me know and I will do so.
Sincerely,
