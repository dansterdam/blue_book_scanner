INSERT FOR THE RECORD

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

Within the Department of Defense, the Air Force has the responsibility of investigating reports on unidentified flying objects and of evaluating any possible threat to our national security that such objects might pose. In carrying out this responsibility, the Air Force has been - and continues to be - both objective and thorough in its treatment of all received reports on unusual aerial objects over the United States. Under the name Project Blue Book, the Air Force carries out a 3-phase program to (1) make an initial investigation of each report received; (2) make a more detailed analysis of reports not explained in phase 1; and (3) disseminate information on sightings, evaluations, and statistics.

In addition to the Project Blue Book program, the Air Force is continuously reviewing its procedures, and changing them when new courses of action will permit them to do their job more effectively. In this particular area, they have focused the outstanding capabilities of their Scientific Advisory Board on the problems of unidentified flying objects. This capable group has just completed its examination of the problems and made its recommendations.
