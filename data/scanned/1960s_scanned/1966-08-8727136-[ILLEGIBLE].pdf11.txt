Dear Mr.
Reference your unidentified observation of 21 August 1966. Your sighting has been compiled and we believe you and others observed bright metallic satellites that are now known.

According to the Star Catalogue there are at least thirty-five thousand man-made satellites in orbit which were placed there over a period of time for which these satellites are visible. This debris constitutes what is often referred to as "saucer sightings". All space vehicles and components for these are quite familiar to the military and civilian astronomy observers.

Because of the large amount of space debris in orbit, it is difficult to determine the actual objects that were viewed.

Thank you for reporting your observation with detailed information.

Sincerely,
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
