Dear Sirs:

I saw an unidentified flying object the sky tonight about 8:30. It was a bright light, which brightened and dimmed for several minutes. Then it moved around, and faded out of sight in about a minute. Area police received eight calls to the local TV station. Some people were as many as 15 minutes, and me I observe that motion as erratic and thought it might be a falling star. I'm not sure, but the flame seemed to direction as to the ground, but a bright red light that a saw with a balloon. There were a couple of times the light appeared to be traveling in an up and down motion with the balloon. I hope this will well help you in your U.F.O. studies.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
