When the observations ended, the shape of the base if condensed into a single, rather indefinite form. No sound was heard. The report also states that the atmosphere and certainly the field indicated that the objects were intelligently controlled.
"The most important fact of the Hallett Base observation was that the passage was registered by a special photographic instrument called "all sky camera,"used for the study of auroras. This instrument has a semi-spherical lens which photographs the whole sky at frequent intervals, according to information released by the New Zealand Scientific and Industrial Research Department. The colours obtained confirmed the visual observation of the UAO. One of the photographs showed a luminous object of definite shape, while the other photographs showed a 'trail', a scientist who was at Hallett Base, the nature of the object could not be established because it was a meteor and there was no information on the fall of a satellite in that region at that occasion.
