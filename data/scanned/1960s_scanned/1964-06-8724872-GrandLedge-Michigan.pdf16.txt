Investigators found no traces of anything unusual on the road over a distance of about 0.2 miles. There were some faint impressions from however. The area where a car's tire had gone and some loose dirt (this area was not paved). This tire-mark may have been what the car's tires, or may have been made by their own car as they returned south on the road. The investigators did not notice anything unusual standing just beyond the dense brushed lining both sides of the road, on the south side. Nearby, the spot where the object was supposed to have across the road and might have been illuminated by reflection from the headlights. The shape of the object, from before the field trip to the location, corresponded to what can be seen under the bushes but anything beyond and larger than this space, such as a drifting cloud of fog, would, of course, take on the shape of the opening, flat on the bottom and a slightly flattened dome on top. It appears to experiment with headlights on any 702 that might appear, or at least determine if fog does arise shortly after dark.
