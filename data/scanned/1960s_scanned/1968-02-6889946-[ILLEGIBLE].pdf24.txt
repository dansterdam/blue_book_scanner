The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a page from an old UFO report document that appears to be a handwritten account or description of a UFO sighting experience.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"We went out to the same location the next night. We did group to help look for any object. It wasn't long when we saw it again. we was so thrilled that it was so visible. We reported the spot at 9:00 and stayed open that night till 11:30. This allowed plenty of time to observe the object and we see it out slightly for 40 or 45 minutes. Most of this time the object was a bright light and once in a while it would dig down or disappear. When it was out our sight on the horizon, we would try the same but the object refused to come out. The only way we describe that the object was not like a star or planet was that it was continuously moving and we decided that it was not a star or planet that we were looking at. The object appeared to have a steady glow and would occasional dim then bright again. Its altitude appeared to be low and early estimate would place it at around 2,000-3,000 feet. Its speed and attitude appeared to be very different from that of a conventional aircraft."
