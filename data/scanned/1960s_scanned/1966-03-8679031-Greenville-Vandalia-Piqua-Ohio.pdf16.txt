Postman Witness
Jimmy Goddard of Saucer Forum, Shepperton, reports that at 12.5 a.m. on the morning of August 28 a post-man was returning to Shepperton. As the postman was walking along the road near Shepperton, he saw an unusual sky object continuing to move along the horizon. The object was silent and the witness is unable to remain anonymous, said the light was so intense that he could not judge the size of the object, but suggested that it could be compared to a distant full moon. He says, "Except for the fact that no sound could be heard, I was reminded that the van's engine was running".
