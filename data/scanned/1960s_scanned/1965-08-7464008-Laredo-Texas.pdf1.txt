10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA
Appears to be a straight flight in accord with a/c observation. The streaks could be attributed to strobed lights on an unusual lighting pattern associated with the object.  The 5 minute length of observation is somewhat shorter than most UFO sightings but cannot be established to a/c.
11. CHIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Suspect that object could not be attributed to a/c.

Object described as a red center flashing blue strobe lights rapidly across the sky to the SE. Disappeared instantly. Observed for 5 minutes. Thunderstorms and occasional lightning in the area.
