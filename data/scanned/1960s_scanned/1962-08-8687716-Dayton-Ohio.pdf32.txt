The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the bottom shows a landscape with buildings and a road, with a curved curved line and a smaller sketch in the upper right corner. The smaller sketch in the upper right corner appears to depict a distant horizon line.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
