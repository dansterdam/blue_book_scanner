He said his attention was diverted upward and saw a large object dark in color hovering over his house. It was perfectly motionless and shaped like a dark oval. The action on the object was sharp and perfectly outlined. It was illuminated. It was the size of an ordinary house and at an estimated 20-30 degree angle from the horizontal. He watched it for about 2-3 seconds and then it seemed to accelerate at a terrific rate, faster than anything he has ever seen, and completely disappeared. He was greatly impressed.
