Dear Sir:

Recently I sent you a letter requesting assistance in identifying an object which I observed in the sky which it crossed the sky, along with the presence of a second, smaller object which remained more or less stationary above the larger object. This gave us the impression that it was an aircraft of some sort; however, since the object was much smaller than the normal jet fighter or bomber, and since it seemed to be moving at a relatively high rate of speed, I'm at a loss in relation to the object concerned as to what it may have been. Since the object disappeared into the distance, there is no possibility that a photograph could have been taken.

Sincerely,
