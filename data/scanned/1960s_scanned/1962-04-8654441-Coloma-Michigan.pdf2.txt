Dear Sirs:

On Friday, April 27, 1962, at approximately 9:15 A.M. C.S.T., I observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) at an approximate altitude of 60 degrees elevation, traveling in a northwesterly direction at an extremely rapid speed, and disappearing into the north.

I watched the object for approximately 10 seconds as it sped across the sky, and it appeared to be oval or circular in shape, and had a metallic luster or sheen. It was so fast that I was unable to determine any additional details or characteristics.

Inasmuch as this sighting is of interest to your organization, I am reporting it to you in accordance with your instructions. If any further information is required, please let me know.

Sincerely yours,
