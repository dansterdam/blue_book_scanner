Text from the document:

CAR WOULD LOOK FROM THAT DIRECTION, WAS PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED WITH THE FACT THAT THE MARKS REMAINED EVEN AFTER THREE AND A HALF MONTHS OF WEATHERING, AND IT WAS HE WHO WONDERED WHETHER COMPACTION TESTS HAD BEEN MADE OF THE SOIL. 

WE THEN RETURNED TO HAVE COFFEE WITH CAPTAIN HOLDER, THE UPRANGE COMMANDING OFFICER FOR WHITE SANDS TO SEE WHETHER HE HAD ANYTHING TO ADD AFTER THIS MANY MONTHS HAD PASSED. CAPTAIN HOLDER IS STILL QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC AND REALLY FAIRLY UNNAMOURED OF THE IDEA OF STRANGE CRAFTS. IT WAS CAPTAIN HOLDER, YOU WILL REMEMBER, WHO, BURNS OF THE FBI, MADE THE ORIGINAL MEASURES BETWEEN THE MARKINGS, AND WE CALL RECALL THAT ALTHOUGH THE FIGURE WAS DRAWN POORLY, WHEN IT WAS REDRAWN ACCORDING TO DIMENSIONS GIVEN, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE DIAGONALS OF THE QUADRILATERAL INTERSECTED AT EXACT RIGHT ANGLES. POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS A WELL KNOWN THEOREM WHICH STATES THAT IF THE DIAGONALS OF ANY QUADRILATERAL INTERSECT AT RIGHT ANGLES, THEN THE POINTS LIE ON A CIRCLE, THE CENTER OF WHICH IS CALLED THE MEAN CENTER OF THE FIGURE. THIS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT ONE OF THE BURNED MARKS WAS DIRECTLY AT THIS MEAN CENTER.

CAPTAIN HOLDER WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN WHAT THE AIR FORCE HAD FOUND OUT FROM THE SAMPLES WHICH HE HAD CAREFULLY GATHERED WITHIN TWO HOURS OF THE SIGHTING, AND WHICH I SUBMITTED TO MD. I HOPE THAT THIS MATERIAL HAS NOT BEEN DESTROYED AFTER PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS.

WE NEXT VISITED IS A FLIER WHO HAS FLOWN IN 41 STATES, AND IS ALSO AN INSTRUCTOR IN FLYING. SHE COMES INTO THE PICTURE ONLY BECAUSE, IN THE COURSE OF DISCUSSIONS WITH HER, SHE TURNED UP A UFO STORY OF JUNE 2, 1950 WHICH WAS DULY REPORTED TO THE AIR FORCE AND SHOULD BE IN OUR FILES. I APPEND AS EXHIBIT A HER RATHER INTERESTING AND EXTENSIVE WRITE-UP IN THE .
