30. Case #D

A bright light was seen at same time (Sept) as a large (round?) shape of a material moved at a constant speed of an estimate. The object traveled through 135Â° in 2.7 minutes - 

A spotty at A, different at the horizon.
The lighting was remarkable - not one of the best (at that time) type of materialization of UFO's.
We were just mystified and speculated for many days.
