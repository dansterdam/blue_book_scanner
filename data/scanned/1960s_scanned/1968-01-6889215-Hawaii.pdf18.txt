The image provided does not contain any photograph or image, but rather a blank space with instructions and a handwritten note. The instructions ask the viewer to "DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON, INCLUDING ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING." The handwritten note reads: "This is NOT a possible exposure or covering. The alleged object was very small, and oval shaped, about the size of the moon. The moon may have obscured the real size and shape of the object."

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:
