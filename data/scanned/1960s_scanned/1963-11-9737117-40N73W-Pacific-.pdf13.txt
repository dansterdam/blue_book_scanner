The image contains a photograph depicting a newspaper or magazine article about a "Study Mystery Space Object". The article discusses a mysterious object that is brighter than the sun and is estimated to be about 1.2 million light years away. The article mentions theories that this object could be the result of a "gravitational collapse" and that scientists at the California Institute of Technology are studying it.

Space Object
DALLAS, TEX. (AP)--Did the nebulous mass with two star-like features in fasion yesterday cause a sensation in scientific circles? Theories, some wild, some profound, were advanced to explain the mysterious object which by the Palomar Observatory's estimates is 1.2 million light years away and 100 times brighter than the sun. 
Despite its tremendous brightness, the strange object has defied detailed astronomical study. Theories based on the assumption that it could be an exploded galaxy, or the result of a gravitational collapse, have been advanced. The object is about 1.200 millton light years distant and its apparent size is about 3 times the diameter of the full moon.

The strange celestial phenomenon has scientists at the California Institute of Technology and Prof. William A. Fowler of the same institute puzzled. Dr. Fred Hoyle, a British astrophysicist, who developed the theory of the steady-state universe, says the object could be the result of a gravitational collapse--a phenomenon which continues to pour forth energy that exceeds the output of many galaxies.
