Thousand Palms
California
FLYING OBJECT SIGHTED
About 7:00 PM on July 7, 1968, a resident of Thousand Palms, California, observed a bright, glowing object in the sky. The object was first seen in the northeast and was reported to be moving in a northerly direction.
The object was described as being as large as a jet airliner and was brightly lit up, appearing to have red and blue lights on its surface. It was observed for several minutes before disappearing from sight.
The report was received and investigated by the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book.
