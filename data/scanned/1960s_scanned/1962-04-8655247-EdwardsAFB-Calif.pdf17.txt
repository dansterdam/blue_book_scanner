AF Academy To Get
Basic Research Lab

RADC Man Gives
New Solution For
Radio Puzzler

An Air Force X-15 ground-based research laboratory is to be established at the AF Academy in Colorado Springs. The laboratory, to be operated jointly by the AF Academy and the Research and Development Command, will be the first of its kind in the nation to be located at an educational institution. It will serve as a research center for basic research in aerospace engineering, problems involved in X-15 operations, and other advanced fields of Aerospace Research.

This new development is in line with the AF Academy's program of providing the cadet corps with the latest technical facilities and instruction for their education and training.

special Acts Award

Yellow Springs engineer, Robert Towne, has been awarded a special act award by the Department of Defense. He was cited for outstanding work in designing and developing a special tent-like chamber used in low pressure experiments. The citation carries with it a cash award of $150.00.

Martin-Denver Gets
Algae Research Lab

The Air Force has awarded the Martin-Denver Division a contract to build a special laboratory for research into the possibilities of growing algae for use as a source of supplementary food for long duration space flights. The contract provides for the development, construction and testing of facilities to grow various types of algae under controlled conditions.

Cancer Detection
Seen As By-Product Of
Research In Human Speech

A diagnostic technique which may well lead to the effective detection of early stages of certain types of cancer was recently developed from current research into the anatomy of human speech.

This work has a relationship to medical diagnosis which may prove unexpectedly valuable. Though the research was originally designed to advance basic scientific knowledge of the speech process, it has resuited in the discovery of a pattern of voice characteristics that appears to reveal physiological abnormalities in the human vocal system.

In pursuing his investigations of the mechanism of speech, the scientist involved, Dr. R. L. Miller of Bell Telephone Laboratories, observed that distinct variations in the sound quality of a person's voice seem to be related to specific anatomical changes in the structures involved in speech production. Analysis of high-quality tape recordings of various individuals speaking has enabled Dr. Miller to define a number of voice parameters that are affected by structural changes in the larynx, throat and other speech organs.

This research has led to the belief that deviations from the normal patterns of these voice parameters may provide a practical means of detecting early physiological changes associated with the onset of certain types of cancer in the areas involved in speech. If this relationship can be fully established, it could result in a new and valuable diagnostic tool for the early detection of cancer.

The implications of this work have not gone unnoticed in the medical world. Officials of the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society have expressed keen interest in the possible applications of this speech research for cancer detection. Further joint investigations to explore these possibilities are now underway.
