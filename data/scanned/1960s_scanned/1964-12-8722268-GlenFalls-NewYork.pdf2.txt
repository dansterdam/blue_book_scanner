QUESTION
This is a page in an old UFO report document from project blue book. Please describe any photograph that is present. Not every image will contain a photograph. Then, please act as an OCR system and produce and output all the text found in the document and nothing else. For context: the filename including page number is data/scanned/1960s_scanned/1964-12-8722268-GlenFalls-NewYork.pdf2.txt
