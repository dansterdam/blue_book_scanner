The text in the form states: "I saw what appeared to be a lighted, rotating, strange object or objects passing over my house at about 1:35 A.M. on Aug 15, 1961. It was traveling quite rapidly and headed in a SSW direction. It was very curious and appeared to be unlike any conventional air craft I have ever seen. I continue to wonder at the nature of this object."
