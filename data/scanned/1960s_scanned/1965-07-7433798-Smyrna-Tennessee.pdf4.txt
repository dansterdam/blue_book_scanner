PART II
OBSERVER WAS LYING IN HAMMOCK AND OBSERVED THE OBJECT PASS 
BY A VERY BRIGHT STAR THAT WAS LOCATED DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.
THE OBJECT TRAVELED AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED ON A STRAIGHT
SSW COURSE FOR 6 TO 7 MINUTES. WAS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE
ALTITUDE. OBSERVER STATED THAT HE FELT THAT IT WAS A
SATELLITE BUT LATER DECIDED TO REPORT IT DUE TO THE
EXTREME BRIGHTNESS AND SPEED OF THE OBJECT. THE STAR IT
PASSED WAS IN HIS OPINION THE BRIGHTEST IN THE SKY AND THE
OBJECT WAS JUST AS BRIGHT BUT WITH NO EVIDENCE OF CONTRAILS
OR STREAM AS SEEN WITH SHOOTING STARS. ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS
WILL FOLLOW BY LTR AS INFO COLLECTED.
