Queried. In the case of suspected aircraft sightings, contact is made with the Air Defense Command, the Strategic Air Command, local airports, and the Federal Aviation Agency.

Balloon sightings are referred to one or more of the following: Balloon Control Center (Holloman AFB), U.S. Weather Bureau (Ashville, N.C.), local airports and weather stations, and various industries (e.g., General Mills) and universities which are conducting balloon research activities. Satellite information is checked by reference to printed ECHO (the large reflector satellite) schedules, NASA satellite reports, Smithsonian North and South Equatorial Crossings, and the Space Detection and Tracking Systems (SPADATS). Missile information is obtained by contacting Cape Kennedy (Fla.), Vandenberg AFB (Calif.), Point Mugu (Calif.), Wallops Island (Va.), or military units involved in special exercises.

Special Air Force analytical groups, and on occasion Eastman Kodak Co., handle the technical aspects of radar sightings and most photographic reports. Physical specimens suspected of connection with the sightings are processed by such groups as Battelle Memorial Institute (ceramics), the Air Force Material Laboratory, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Libby Owens and Corning Fiberglass companies (glass), and certain academic groups (e.g., Northwestern University Department of Geology).
