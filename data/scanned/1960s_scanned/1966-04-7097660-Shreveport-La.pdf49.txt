There is no photograph present on this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. However, the image contains handwritten text that appears to be part of the report.

Here is the text extracted from the image:

At some close and expected shower it surely produces a most strange aspect. The radio played statice and the engine went on and off. They then saw a circular light, perceptively from the direction as described, very close and only about 20 ft. wide, as well as 45 ft. long, which was approaching and disappearing, then reappearing again. They say it appeared to be a "whirlwind" moving and up and off the ground again and the light did not reflect a beam but appeared illuminated from within. At that time two others on the road witnessed the same, and the light did not reflect a beam but appeared illuminated from within. At that time two others on the road witnessed the same, and the light was also seen by an of-ficer responding from the other direction, who also witnessed it disappear.
