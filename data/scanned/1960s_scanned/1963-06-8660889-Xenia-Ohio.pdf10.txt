20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the path, or "R" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object. Estimate how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this exercise at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

YES, FLASHING OUT

24. In order that you can give as close a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the common object or objects which, when placed in the sky, would give the same appearance as what you saw.
