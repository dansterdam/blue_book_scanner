In Saucer Mystery 
SOCORRO NM - The mystery of a reported unidentified flying object sighted by a police officer near Socorro on an isolated hill remains unsolved. 
The Socorro chapter of the National Investigations Committee of Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) announced a $100 reward to help locate persons who reported seeing the UFO on April 24, 1964. Socorro policeman Lonnie Zamora was quoted as saying he saw the craft and two persons near it. 
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, chairman of the astronomy department at Northwestern University, was quoted in the article as saying he had been to the site and that at least two persons aboard the craft were observed. The article also stated that one other person, Opal Grinder, who was a manager of a Socorro service station, also reported seeing the UFO.
The article mentions that the reward will go to persons who can provide information to establish the credibility of the sighting, according to Dr. Hynek.
