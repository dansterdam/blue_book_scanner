The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text from the document:

The first sighting was at 8:30 P.M. as I walked out the door of my hom and came across some lights in the sky over the hill. These moved across the sky quite rapidly and suddenly came to a halt. They appeared like a good size star, only brighter. At one time they seemed to be gliding side by side and then suddenly take off at a tremendous rate of speed. I cannot say how many there were, but there seemed to be at least three or four. At one time they appeared as just one bright light and then would separate into two or three lights, and then come back together again. I watched them for about 15 to 20 minutes, and they seemed to be moving in all directions, up, down, and sideways.

I went back into the house to get my husband, and when we came back out the lights were still there, but moving farther away. My husband also watched them for some time. It seems to me that they were intelligently controlled, and did not appear to be any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. I have seen many planes and satellites, and these were definitely not like anything I have ever seen before. They moved in a manner that could not be explained by any of the usual explanations given for UFOs. I am quite sure of what I saw, and I am wondering if anyone else in the area saw the same thing.
