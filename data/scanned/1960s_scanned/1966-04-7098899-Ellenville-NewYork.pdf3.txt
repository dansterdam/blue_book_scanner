The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing a UFO sighting in Ellenville, New York on April 8, 1966.

The text in the document is as follows:

To whom this may concern,

On Friday, April 8, 1966, a strange U.F.O. was spotted in Ellenville, New York, and was witnessed by some people. It was first spotted over the mountain, and when it came closer it looked like a ship. It was as long as a quarter of the mountain. The incident was witnessed by many people.

It was first noticed from the third floor of the American Legion on the top floor, and they claim they could see into it and there was an occupant in it, but we thought it would be wise to not be seeing an off colored, white or yellow, and you may not be interesting in this but we thought it only right to report it.
