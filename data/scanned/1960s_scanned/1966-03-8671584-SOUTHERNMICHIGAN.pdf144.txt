The text in the document reads as follows:

As of 1230, 24 March 1966, Major Quintanilla received a telephone call from Congressman Vivian, extension 22-44401. Congressman Vivian requested information on the unidentified flying objects at Dexter, Michigan. He had read the report from that area. Asked Major Quintanilla if he had any remarks on it. Major replied that Dr. Hynek was talking with the policemen and other witnesses gathering information on the observations. Dr. Hynek is on his way to Hillsdale to talk with the ones there. We hope to have a breakthrough within twenty-four hours. Not all of the witnesses observed the same object. Major informed Congressman Vivian that it was good that we had multiple witnesses. 3:40 Moody is up at Willow Run checking out the tower operators. Checking both positive and negative data so we can be doubly sure. We will release the information as to the cause of the observations as soon as possible. Hopefully this information will be this afternoon, 24 March 1966. Dr. Hynek has been given permission to grant a press conference at Selfridge AFB as soon as the conclusions are reached and he has spoken with Major Quintanilla. Congressman Vivian asked about various purported aircraft in the area at the time. Major replied that this was being checked out presently. Congressman Vivian asked that he be notified before a press conference is given by Dr. Hynek.
