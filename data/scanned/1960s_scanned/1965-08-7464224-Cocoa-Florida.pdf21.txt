of speed. It looked like just a flash. And it stayed out there next to this other one for 30 seconds or so, and then it came back and resumed its position in the diamond. It did be damned. This is important: How many degrees per second did it go, that is how fast it travel? Faster than a jet, for instance?

S: Y CM, yes, sir. It looked to me like a meteor. It was a streak. Then, when it stopped, and it stayed out there, and then streaked back.

H: Good heavens. Then you could watch it as it streaked?

S: Yes, it was looking through binoculars.

H: As it approached the west, did it stop abruptly and did it slow down?

S: No, it slowed down.

H: It slowed down, and then stopped.

S: Yes. As far as I could see, the area that I was looking at it would be in the field of vision would be three or four feet as far as the field of vision was concerned. If you understand what I mean.

H: I'm not quite sure. You were looking through binoculars (S: Yes, sir) And it went so fast that you couldn't follow it with binoculars (MAX XXX)

S: No, sir, I had to pick it up again, and as I picked it up it was slowing down, and then it stopped. (H: I see) And then I kept looking at it and it was fairly close to these other objects and then it came back and resumed its position.

H: Did it get as close to the other objects as it was to the others of the diamond formation.
