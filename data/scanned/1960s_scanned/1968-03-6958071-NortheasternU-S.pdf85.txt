The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with the title "MEMO FOR RECORD" and text that describes a UFO observation report from March 1968. The text reads as follows:

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968

Called Cleveland FAA Control Tower (216-267-2190). They received numerous reports. The objects came from SW to NE and were observed about 1 minute. They passed to the south of the city and were about 60 degrees in elevation. As they moved, the objects could not be correlated to the UFOs. The Controller suggested the control tower at Youngstown since they reported it to have passed directly overhead.
