8 August 66, conversation with Dan Descanio (Police Chief) took place concerning operation of the lighthouse in the state park. Chief Descanio said it could not have been possible for the witnesses to have seen the structure of the house because the lighthouse only throws light out over the lake. The 'UFO' isn't seen from the land.

Nothing else on the case had turned up. There had been several other reported in the area.

8 August 1966, conversation with Coast Guard Base, Presque Isle State, Pennsylvania. There was nothing in the log book to indicate the observation of an alleged UFO on the night of 31 July 1966.
