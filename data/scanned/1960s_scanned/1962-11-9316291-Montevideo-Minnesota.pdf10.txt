The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to any familiar object or objects with which you are familiar?
A little larger than a full moon. It falled some more moments later.

22. We want to make a match stick model of the object. Hold a match stick of some length and note how much the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The match head would cover it completely. It was a small, round object.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes. It passed over.

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object you saw.
A full moon, but larger. It was circular. I would say that it was a perfect circle.
