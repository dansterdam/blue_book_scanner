usual for the Lockbocne tanker to circle about for at least an hour) then this can be cleared up also, because , and his wife both felt certain, after a rather insistent recall, that there had been colored lights on the plane, on the draft, and they they must have been red and green, because if they had been anything else they would have noticed it. If we use this highly unspecific intelligence information for all its worth, we can make out a case for the plane having had navigation lights and that either and were so intent on the unusual formation or the rest of the lights that they failed to notice lights that were normal and which they would not have considered at all unusual, or that the tanker had momentarily flipped out its navigation lights in favor of the other bright lights. Even our experience, I can admit that the tanker lights I saw were so bright that I am not certain whether I also saw navigation lights. It is my best belief that I did not. Indeed, if I had, I would not have remained puzzled as long as I did by the apparition. Likewise, the jet should have had navigation lights and these were not reported.
The suggested solution is therefore by no means all-right, but, as a solution, depends crucially upon there being a tanker formation in the area so that time on thinks might, if so, then we must assume that either the navigational lights were cut or went unnoticed.
If this prove? to have been a tanker, it will serve as an excellent example of how an unusual but quite natural phenomenon can remain a UFO for a long while, sometimes permanently, unless investigated as soon as possible.

That is all!!!!!
