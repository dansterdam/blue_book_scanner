Meteorite Search by Helicopter
First indication of a meteorite search by helicopter was around 1 April 1962 when some debris was reported by SAC's Dr. Hynek through Dr. Fred B. Wood on a flight from Covington, Va., to Pittsburgh, Pa. 
Blue is checking a Pittsburgh, N.W. meteorite report by an individual who reported that he thought he had fallen during the night.
No photo was obtained of the suspected meteorite patch.
The writer also went on a search flight on 17 April 1962 with Capt. Saul from Edwards AFB and Drake and found no evidence of a meteorite, although a 15-lbs. sample of black and brown debris was collected. 
This series of frightening incidents in which the Air Force and other agencies are expending considerable time and effort investigating suspected meteorites, many of which turn out to be natural phenomena, demonstrates the highly unstable state of the public's idea concerning phenomena involving the sky. Reliable and responsible sources of information are urgently needed to clarify the situation and prevent needless expenditure of manpower and funds.
