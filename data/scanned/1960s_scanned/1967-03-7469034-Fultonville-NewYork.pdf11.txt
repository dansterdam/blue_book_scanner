Text output from the document:

Utica Press reporters last night received three reports of large orange ball along the Southern horizon. The reports came from West Winfield, Whitesboro and New York Mills. 

The object appeared to be larger than the moon. It first appeared as a very bright light and then seemed to disappear as if being covered by a cloud. It then reappeared very bright and seemed to explode.

Kenneth Davis, West Winfield Press correspondent, identified the object shortly before 7 p.m.

The Old Farmers Almanac said the moon would rise at 5:28 a.m. today. It reported that the moon set at 5:56 p.m. and would not have been visible at the time the object was seen.
