The image appears to contain a photograph of several inflatable structures or balloons used in space exploration. The caption below the image is titled "DECELERATION BALLOONS" and describes how this type of structure, when opened up at high altitudes, can act as a parachute to slow down the reentry of a vehicle. The text also mentions that this technology is used on the "Titan missile" to bring back a 500-pound weight, and that the speed of this inflation process is 3.5 times the speed of sound.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE

There are two basic types of re-entry that we can encounter. One is the ballistic type, where you have some type of vehicle to let you come down, and the other is the lifting type, where you come in with wings and can fly in the atmosphere. 

With these expandable types of structures, we find both of these types of units can be put on a launch pad in a small package.

Working with the Air Force and NASA, using their laboratories, we found that you can handle these ballistic-type vehicles, which you can see at the left here, with a torus-type ring around it, which can be attached to a re-entry vehicle or escape capsule.

This item, when opened up in the high altitudes, is actually positioned by the inflation to open when there is no air. As it comes through the particular type of vehicle can do it, this balloon inflates by 252 pounds, makes it act like a shuttle-cock, and brings the weight.

This is used on the Titan missile to bring back about a 500-pound weight. I would like to show some movies of this in the NASA tunnels at 2-1/2 times the speed of sound.

Dr. Ross. You will have to watch it closely. The inflates in two-tenths of a second. This is 3-1/2 times the speed of sound.
