The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten letter addressed to the "Superintendent of the U.S.A.F. Headquarters, D. of C." The letter discusses a sighting of an object on the night of October 1967 and the writer's experience with filing a report about it. The letter is signed at the end.

Text from the document:

Headquarters, D. of C. 
Dear Sir,

On the night of Craten (1967 & believe) I filled out a form on a U.F.O. (supposedly) writing that some might remember. It was mailed to you the next day. I've heard absolutely nothing of it yet.

What happened?

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

P.S. Don't let my handwriting fool you.
