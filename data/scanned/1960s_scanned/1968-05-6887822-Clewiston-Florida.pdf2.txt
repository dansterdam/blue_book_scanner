May 20, 1968

Dear Sir:

One after the other on the night of May the 18, 1968 about 10 o'clock 7 U.F.O.s were seen. It was about 10:50 when the last one was seen, but 30 minutes earlier the first ones were through small groups of condors vehicles. They descended in formation. All the objects were seen through good binoculars as they crossed the one in formation. All of the witnesses were seen through good binoculars as they crossed the one in formation. After this encounter we decided to grant a clue so we would like some advice from you.

Sincerely Yours

P.S. 1. 4 witnesses were A.
