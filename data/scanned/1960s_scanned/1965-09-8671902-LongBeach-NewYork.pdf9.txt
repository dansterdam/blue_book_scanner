NOV 12 1965

TO: HQ USAF SAFOID (Mrs Hunt)

Reference the attached report of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting at Cloverdale, Ohio on 2 September 1965 as forwarded to you by the UFO TPEW/UFO. The following characteristics of this sighting are of particular interest:

1. The object was observed to move in a circular path and was simultaneously observed by more than one observer.
2. The object appears to have been surrounded by a luminous glow or "halo" around its circumference.
3. The object was seen to hover and then to move away at a very high rate of speed.
4. The object was of considerable size (estimated 50-100 feet in diameter) and was observed to be at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet above the terrain.

If the above information is correct, then it is likely that a high-flying aircraft was the cause of the sighting.
