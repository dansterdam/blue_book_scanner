Dear Sirs:
This is a report of the incident I described to the Air Force on March 9. 1960.
Office of the Secretary
Dear Sir:
I did not send an original picture, as I stated in my telephone conversation. The pictures - taken on the film I referred to - have not yet been developed. Due to my business and other factors, I was unable to get the film developed earlier. I assure you, however, that as soon as the film is developed, a print will be forwarded to the proper authorities.
I know this was a serious incident, and I am anxious to cooperate fully in any investigation that may be conducted. The object I observed was, to me, a totally unfamiliar sight. It hovered for several minutes over the area, and then disappeared from view at a very high rate of speed. I have no explanation for what I saw, and I am looking forward to hearing from you regarding this matter.
Sincerely yours,
R. Allen James
