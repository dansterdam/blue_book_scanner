Text from the document:

THE FLEMINGTON, NEW JERSEY LANDING: ABOUT JULY 14, 1954, A. NEWSPAPERMAN FROM FLEMINGTON, N.J. REPORTED A STRANGE OBJECT WHICH HE SIGHTED IN THE SKY OVER HIS COMMUNITY. HE SAID THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, SILVER IN COLOR, AND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL AIRPLANE WING. IT HOVERED BRIEFLY OVER THE TOWN AND THEN SHOT AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW ALMOST INSTANTLY. HIS ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT WAS PUBLISHED IN A LOCAL NEWSPAPER. HOWEVER, DESPITE EFFORTS TO OBTAIN A CLIPPING OF THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE, NO COPY COULD BE LOCATED, EITHER IN THE NEWSPAPER FILES OR IN THE POSSESSION OF THE WITNESS.
