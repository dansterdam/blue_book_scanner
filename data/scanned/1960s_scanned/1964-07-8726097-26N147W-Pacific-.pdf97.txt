Dear Captain Ronys:

Reports relating to the alleged observation by you of a strange phenomenon on 23 July 1964. We are amazed at the degree of validity of your report bearing in mind the general skepticism that exists regarding the subject of UFOs.

The object observed by you was described as being dark in color, smooth, cigar-shaped, and it hovered for several minutes at an altitude of about five thousand feet near your position before it suddenly accelerated at an incredible speed and disappeared from view. This description is consistent with many other UFO sightings reported to us.

We would be most interested in obtaining any additional information you may have regarding this incident, such as the exact time of the observation, the direction of movement, and any other details that may aid us in our investigation. Your cooperation in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
