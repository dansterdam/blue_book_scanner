OFFICIAL FILE COPY
TD8-1/Lt Col Friend/5928
UFO Sighting (Oradell, N.J., 13 Feb 62)
19 USAF SAPO-33 (Major Hart)
SAPO 28 FB
This reference to the attached copy of a
report of a UFO sighting received and forwarded from the 10th Aerospace
Defense Squadron is transmitted, both for information and to obtain suggestions
as to the scope and detail of information you may desire for the file.
The report is limited, both in scope and detail, for the following reasons:
1. The observer was a 10-year-old boy and the most logical causes for
the phenomenon described might conceivably be "out of this world."
2. The sighting was very brief and no physical evidence remains.
3. No instrument readings or other data to corroborate the sighting.
If the witness can provide further information, I will be glad to obtain it.
However, it is my opinion that this report, since it is based solely on the
recollection of a 10-year-old, has little significance, either as to the
identification of the object seen or as an addition to the data of UFO sightings.
The case is submitted for your information and any comments you care to make.
