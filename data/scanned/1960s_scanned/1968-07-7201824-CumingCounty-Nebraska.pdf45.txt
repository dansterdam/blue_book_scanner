Dear Mr. _______,

This will reply to your letter dated July 31, 1968, at which time you desire additional information on the unidentified flying object (UFO) seen on July 20, 1968.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation as to the unidentified aerial object you described. Unless some additional data is obtained by you and submitted for evaluation, our technical people will not be able to investigate this matter further.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the United States Air Force, which has a UFO investigator who is in a better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more complete analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the existing unidentified object by use of the categories of objects that are reported as UFO's in the Project Blue Book Report and Documentation.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. HIGMAN
