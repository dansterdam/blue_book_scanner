The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, a historical US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text reads as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 29 Oct 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Sketches and explanations are enclosed.

On April 7, 1966 I took two pictures, on Oct. 8, 1966 I took six pictures and on Oct. 15, 1966 I took six pictures each time within the time lapse film in my camera. With the naked eye the object looked about the same each time. However, the film in the camera developed images that have been developed differ somewhat from what I saw with the naked eye.

Can you explain the reason for this difference in the slides?

I am sorry that I do not have the original slides which I took on April 7, 1966 as I let someone have them just the day before I received this questionnaire. I am enclosing a copy of the original slide. I will have the original slide back at a later date.

The enclosed slides of the Oct. 8th and Oct. 15th sightings are the original slides.

I will appreciate your returning these slides when you are thru with them.
