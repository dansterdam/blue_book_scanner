"Did Bomb or Saucer Put Hole in a British Potato Patch?

The small hamlet of Charlton, England (population 423) was suddenly placed in the limelight during July, 1963, when a strange 6-foot wide crater appeared in a potato field. 

Two members of parliament demanded an investigation. An Army bomb disposal squad appeared on the scene on July 24th, stating that they were tackling the "normal bomb disposal job." 

Speculation rippled around the country. Some thought it was a meteor, while others feared it was the crater of a landed "flying saucer." Hundreds of curious sightseers began to appear in the area and Australian scientists stated that they had no knowledge of the man.

On July 26th it was announced that the Army unit, which had been digging for several miles, failed to find any sign of a buried charge. The interest in the incident is yet to be satisfactorily explained. Why do several points not fit the meteor explanation. There was the fact that in a neighboring barley field, a fifty-foot wide circle of the grain had been pressed flat to the ground. Also coinciding with the advent of the crater was the fact that one of Mr. W's young pigs, sleeping under a tree nearby, had died mysteriously during the night. Was it a meteor? Probably not without killing the pig. Whatever caused the hole in the potato field, apparently unconnected to any other known phenomenon, remains a mystery.

Last issue of Saucer Album, we discussed the censorship of information regarding the crashed saucers, crashes where sometimes we feel that the information is not at all akin to truth. But here, how do we explain the vanished vegedatas, burned livestock, etc. contacted with this?"
