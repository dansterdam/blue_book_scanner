The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and some instructions. The diagram shows a curved skyline and a compass rose, with instructions for the observer to imagine the point where the object was sighted and draw its position relative to the horizon and compass. The instructions also ask the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object and any changes in direction during the course.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
