Dear Sir:
Over Pennsylvania on Nov. 27 a brilliant fireball appeared at 6:59 p.m. EST and on Dec. 7 about 2:10.
Many reports, particularly on the former, have come in and we would appreciate information on either or both of these fireballs which seem to have been witnessed from a wide area. Did an adequate report on either or these fireballs reach your office? If not, we would be glad to learn more about them if you care to make such information available to us.
Yours truly,
[REDACTED]
