The text in the document is as follows:

The sight is said to have a slightly larger size than a quarter. It appeared to be round and metallic in nature. It was hovering at an estimated altitude of 300 feet and was traveling at a high rate of speed, approximately 700 mph. It was first observed by the observer and another person approximately 2 miles south of Canyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana. It disappeared rapidly out of sight, proceeding in a northerly direction. The observer was certain that what he observed was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, balloon or other known object. The report states that during the time of the sighting, the weather was clear and there was a full moon. The observer described the object as having no visible means of propulsion or lights, and it made no sound. The report indicates that the observer was an employee of the Bonneville Power Administration and had sighted many conventional aircraft during his employment over the years. He was confident that this sighting was of an unusual nature.
