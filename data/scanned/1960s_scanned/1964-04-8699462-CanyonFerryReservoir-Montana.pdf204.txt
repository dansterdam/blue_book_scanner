There is no photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a typed report or summary describing alleged sightings of "flying saucers" landing in Montana. The text describes the objects as "a large top-shaped ship with a row of lights around its circumference" and mentions various details about the sightings, including claims of effects on electrical equipment and the reactions of a witness. The document is marked as "Information Only" and appears to be from the Missoula, Montana area in April.

MORE SAUCER LANDINGS IN MONTANA: According to a weird story in the Missoulian-Sentinel, in Missoula, Montana, flying saucers have been "landing frequently" at a farm there since early last April. Mr. and Mrs. Allen Lund, who live on the slopes of a mountain, say that the object has landed three times recently, and has made some unusual maneuvers. The Lunds describe the object as "a large top-shaped ship with a row of lights around its slightly rounded bottom surface."

There have been many side-effects of these frequent visitations. Before the landings began, wild game such as deer and bear used to visit their property regularly. Each landing frightens and drives them away, however, and it is sometimes several days before they return. The oil furnace lights itself, with no apparent explanation. But strongest of all, says the Lund's son, 35 years old, is the bolt of a man with whom he talks, alone in the barn. He has told them the man's name, but Miss Lund says the man almost unrecognizable. The child refuses to allow anyone to accompany him when the man appears, and likewise, the boy does "to go see the man," the dogs run into the house and the oil furnace lights. Television interference has also been noticed during the saucer visitations, which have continued at almost regular intervals for several months.
