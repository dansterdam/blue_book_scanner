GROUND LIGHTS
Round reddish orange or glowing light, believed to be about 270 degrees in azimuth and 45 degrees in altitude. The light appeared to be about 8 inches in diameter. It would disappear for 2-3 seconds and reappear on the ground or a few feet off the ground. The light was observed to be resembling "fluorescent lights" and these circles may represent lights or some sort of pulsation or observation in the area between mountains.
COMMENTS: Ground lights were observed to light from flashlight or other such solid body. Possibly these lights from hunters in the woods, some similar lights were observed.
