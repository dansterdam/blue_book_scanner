  Enclosed is the attached letter with enclosings from the Philadelphia Enquirer  relating to unidentified flying objects. The following is submitted for your information:

a. Dear Mr. - - - - - - -

  The Air Force does not disregard any reports officially submitted to this organization. The photographs which you enclosed were analyzed, but no positive identification could be made of the air force as the time an investigation would have been made. There is nothing further that it is possible to attempt an investigation concerning this alleged incident.

Regarding the articles from the Philadelphia Enquirer - 
A review of the data indicates the articles have not changed our position on this subject. The balloons observed over the article described as an "astronomical body". This evaluation was made by HAFB from India. As a result, no special investigation was considered warranted.

The attached brochure represents the Air Force conduct of the UFO program to date.

FOR THE COMMANDER

WILLIAM H. JOHNSON, Colonel, USAF
Deputy Director
