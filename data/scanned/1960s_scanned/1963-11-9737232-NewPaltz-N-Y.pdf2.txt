This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document includes a section titled "Lunar Libration Chart" which shows a chart related to lunar libration, as well as text describing the chart and related information. There is also a section titled "Precision Diagonals" which appears to be some kind of technical information or specifications.

LUNAR LIBRATION CHART
This chart shows the hourly positions of the Lnnar north and south nodes during a complete Lunar cycle. The locations of the nodes at perigee (nearest distance from the earth) and apogee (farthest distance from the earth) are marked, as are the mean positions oF the nodes at different phases of the Moon. The libration cycles of the Moon are very complex and numerous; this chart depicts only the most general and prominent features.
The locations of the nodes are of interest with respect to UFO phenomena, since objects are often reported moving in and out of the Lunar disc, or near the limb of the Moon, during various Lunar phases and libration conditions. This is the apparent facility for both visual and radar recognition and observation. The more rapid motion of the Lunar nodes and the perigee-apogee cycle may provide a correlation with some UFO sightings and activities.
