MR. WW CHAUNCEY an object which he assumed to be a satellite. The object was observed between 12 - 15 August while on a trip to the Sequoia National Park, California. On the third night of the flight, it is likely that the object observed was not a satellite, as known satellite orbits have been checked and do not coincide with the observation. All known satellites are listed in THE OBSERVER'S HANDBOOK, and the observation was made on succeeding nights. It is, therefore, unlikely that the observed object was a known satellite.

We are attaching a list of the visible satellites observed and noted.
