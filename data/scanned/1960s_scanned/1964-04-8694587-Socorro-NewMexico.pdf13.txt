The image does not contain any photographs, only text. I will proceed to extract all the text from the image:

There was no evidence of markings of any sort in the area other than the shallow depressions at the location where Mr. Zamora reported sighting the object.

Laboratory analysis of soil samples disclosed no foreign material or radiation above background for the surrounding area.

Laboratory analysis of the burned brush showed no chemicals which would indicate a type of propellant. 

There was no evidence presented that the object was extraterrestrial in origin or represented a threat to the security of the United States.

The Air Force is continuing its investigation and the case is still open.

For several days following this report, other sightings were reported in the New Mexico area. In each case the sightings were determined to be a known object or natural phenomena. Two of the reports were determined to be hoaxes.
