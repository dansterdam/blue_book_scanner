Dear Allen:

This is a joint letter from Lyle Boyd and myself relative to the Socorro, New Mexico, incident of April 24th. We are very kindly seeking your opinion and we ask a chance to study them in detail before checking with.

I think it is interesting that our independent thinking had come to some of the same conclusions regarding the characteristics of this case, which appears to be the most interesting one yet reported in an interim nature.  

Both of us approached this problem like that presented in the Socorro incident, very carefully, and we intend to accept the facts as nearly as possible at face value, and then to come up with some suggested solutions or comments.

We feel that the unearthly character of the incident in itself may have clouded the facts. Had the sighting been related to an earth-type source, the situation might have been better followed up. Anyway, we shall make our interpretations and suggestions, and hopes that it is not too late for someone to check us more carefully.

We first take a question concerning the nature of the change in the luminosity of this craft. When first seen, it was cone-shaped with nothing on top, and the bottom was circular and was orange at the bottom. Light blue as the top. How are we to explain the change?
