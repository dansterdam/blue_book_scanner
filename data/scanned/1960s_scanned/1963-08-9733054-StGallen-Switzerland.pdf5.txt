SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING

On 9 August 1963, a crew of five individuals observed a strange light in the sky over St. Gallen, Switzerland. The light was described as a large, oblong object, approximately 50 feet in length, which maneuvered in the sky for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing from view. 

Ground radar systems were unable to detect the object, and no other witnesses have come forward. It is suggested that a copy of this release be sent to APRO by the addressee.
