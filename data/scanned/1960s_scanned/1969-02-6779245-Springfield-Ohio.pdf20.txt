The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with a form-like structure capturing various details about a reported UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
HOVER?
CHANGE COURSE?
GIVE OFF LIGHT?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SIZE?
SPLIT UP?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN, TWIST OR DART?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
