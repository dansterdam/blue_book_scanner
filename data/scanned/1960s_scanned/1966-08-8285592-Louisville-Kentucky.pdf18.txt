The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten page from an old document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

The first one was a case where a man and woman were seen flashing lights. They did not move on far as we can see. The car oscillated, would move a little passed, but those steps there. Some area of sky not moving caused, we had to keep shifting because telescope for them were worthless.

So what it may concern:
If at all possible it would appreciate someone informing me of any action that is taking concern. These sightings, or letting me know if there is an application for these things.
