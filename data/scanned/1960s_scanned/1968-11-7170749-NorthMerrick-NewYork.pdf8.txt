DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING

TIME: APPROXIMATELY 7:50 P.M.

The witness observed a bright light in the sky that was brighter than a star and moved more rapidly than an aircraft. The light appeared to maneuver and move erratically, which was described as "more probable than to absolutely conclusively confirm". The witness had no other comments or additional information to provide regarding the sighting.
