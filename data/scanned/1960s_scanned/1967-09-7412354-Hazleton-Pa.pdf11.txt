2. Speed, focal length, and make of lens:
3. Brand and type of film:
4. Shutter speed used:
5. Lens opening used; that is, "f" stop:

Dear sirs:
I am sorry, but at the time of the sighting, I did not think of getting a camera. And the most important thing about this is that the object was moving entirely too fast for a camera to have taken an intelligible photo. If you think more information is needed, feel free to tell me about it. I will be more than happy to give it. When and if you come to a conclusion, please inform me.
Thank you very much.
