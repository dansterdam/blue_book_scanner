On August 6, 1963, at approximately 11:30 p.m., the witness observed a bright light over Baker Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada. The light was first spotted in the north and moved rapidly to the east, then stopped and hovered for a short time before moving to the south and disappearing. The witness described the light as bright and pulsating, and it appeared to be approximately the size of a small airplane at a distance. The observation lasted approximately 5 minutes.
