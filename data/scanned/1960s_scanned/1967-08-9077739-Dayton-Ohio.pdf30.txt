Transcription of the text:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 31 8 67

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I was observing the stars in the night sky at about 10:30 p.m. when I noticed an unusual object in the sky. It was about 50 feet in diameter, circular in shape, and had flashing lights around the perimeter. It was moving in a zig-zag motion and was completely silent. At times it appeared to hover, and at other times it would suddenly dart off at a high rate of speed. This went on for about 10-15 minutes. 

I do not want to be identified. I am a businessman and I am concerned that if this were made public, it could have a negative impact on my business. Please treat this information in a confidential manner. I would be willing to provide more details to an officer at a later time, but I do not wish for my name to be associated with this report.

Sincerely,
