Letter of 4 April 1967
Reference your letter of 4 April 1967 regarding your observation of an unidentified flying object. A detailed investigation revealed that you probably observed the planet Venus which, at the time of the sighting, was low in the western sky. Venus, with a stellar magnitude of -3.5 on 3 April 1967, would have been the brightest astronomical body in the western sky.  

We had no additional reports from this area on the night of 3 April 1967; however, for the past month and a half, Venus has been responsible for numerous UFO observations.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
