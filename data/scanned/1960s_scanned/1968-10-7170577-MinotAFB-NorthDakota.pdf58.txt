AS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SIGHTING
MRS. TWO OR THREE HUNDRED 3000 FEET VISIBLE MANZOLITE

IN WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE APPEARANCE OF THIS OBJECT? TO WHAT WOULD YOU COMPARE IT IN SHAPE OR CONFIGURATION.
A COMMON OBJECT OR OBJECTS WHICH, WHEN PLACED IN THE SKY, WOULD BE SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU NOTED THE APPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT TO BE.

AS NEARLY AS I CAN DETERMINE, THIS OBJECT OR SIGHTING WAS A ROUND OR DISC SHAPED HOVERING OBJECT, SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN A BASKETBALL, POSSIBLY SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER. IT APPEARED TO BE METALLIC IN NATURE, OR AT LEAST HAVE A METALLIC SURFACE FINISH, AND EXHIBITING A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT OR LUMINOUS APPEARANCE, ALMOST GLOWING IN ITS BRIGHTNESS. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY, HOVERING ABOVE THE GROUND, AND REMAINED IN VIEW FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE SUDDENLY ACCELERATING AND DISAPPEARING FROM SIGHT AT A TREMENDOUS RATE OF SPEED.

A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUND OR LEAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDANCE. DOES NOT APPLY.
