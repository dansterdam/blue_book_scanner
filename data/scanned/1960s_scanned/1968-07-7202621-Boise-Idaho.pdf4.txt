INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFC)

This investigation was conducted by Sgt Theodore C. Ackley, Security Police Squadron, Mountain Home AFB, Idaho.

On 7 August 1968, William M. Cunnene, Boise Police Department, Boise, Idaho was contacted by the Security Police Squadron, Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The original report from Mr. Cunnene indicates that at approximately 9:00 p.m. (MDT) on 6 August 1968, he and his wife observed a bright light in the sky moving in various directions. He stated that the light appeared to be round and about the size of a business envelope held at arm's length. Other police officers observed the same phenomena; however, these officers could not identify the object.

Attempts were made to contact Mr. Cunnene at his residence to obtain further details, but he was not available. A telephone call was made to the Boise Police Department to schedule an appointment for an interview, but no one was available.
