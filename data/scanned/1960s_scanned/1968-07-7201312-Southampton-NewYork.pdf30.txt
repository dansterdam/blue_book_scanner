NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
Inter-Office Correspondence

Date December 10, 1968

To: Dr. J. Allen Hynek  
From: Arthur L. Howland
Dept: Astronomy    
Dept: Geology

The sample sent to you as an unidentified flying object is a pumice-like glass. It has an irregular, rough surface and appears to have some cavities. There are a few crystals visible in the cavities.

The sample closely resembles a manufactured product that has been marketed as "sanding blocks" for precision woodworking. It also has the same physical characteristics as the sanding blocks. I do not have any of the commercial material at hand for comparison, but it seems probable that your sample is a fragment of the same material.

I am returning the sample herewith.
