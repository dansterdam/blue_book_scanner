ADDITIONAL DETAILS OF OFFENSE, PROGRESS OF INVESTIGATION, ETC.

The two boys stated they both seen a reddish bright object in a northwesterly direction. It appeared to be a distance. The object came up first at about a 30 degree angle and then after it got up a ways, it went to the north northwest and came down again at a very low altitude. It hovered for a short while and then zigzagged up higher and higher until it disappeared. This is shown in the two pictures. They were asked as to the color of the object and they stated it was reddish or orange in color. There was no blue light, no green light. There was no other color lights to the object except natural bright red.

We went out to the location and the subject showed us where they were when they saw this object. It was about 3/4 of a mile from the boys location where the object first appeared and where it came down at a low altitude. The ground in the area where there was some of the plowed ground sticking out and small snow drifts as all covered with icy frost.

Colonel Jackson, Commander of the 119th Combat Support Group at Hector Airport was called and he stated that he would contact Grand Forks Air Force Base and see if the Air Defense Command would be notified to see if the object could be identified. No further information is available at this time.

2-26-67 - Went the area where the object was supposedly located and could not find any indication of where an object may have landed or been close to the ground. Mark Arndt came and looked at the area but found nothing.
