14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It just seemed to disappear, just the light went out, as if hit the ground, or went behind trees.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Seemed to be a light, no sound here, we seen it last.
b. Color Bright white light, left light, the bluish there change.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Seems a greatest, it's very almost 5.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
Seems it was a light it would be difficult to draw a picture but here is drawn in relation to what we seen at that time.
