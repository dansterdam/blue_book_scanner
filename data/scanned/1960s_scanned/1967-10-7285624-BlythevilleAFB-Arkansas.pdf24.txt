The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with a form-like structure and handwritten text filling out the various sections.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the text from the document:

CONDITIONS (Check appropriate blocks):
A. SKY	B. WEATHER

NIGHT CLEAR	CIRRUS CLOUDS (High Feathery or Wispy)

C. IF THE SIGHTING WAS AT TWILIGHT OR NIGHT, WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE STARS AND MOON?

MOON HIDDEN BY CLOUDS
UNKNOWN

D. DURING THE DAY, WAS THE PHENOMENON VISIBLE IN DAYLIGHT?
YES	NO

12. GIVE A CRISP DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARKER OR LIGHTER THAN THE SURROUNDING SKY. DESCRIBE ITS SHAPE, SIZE, COLOR, BRIGHTNESS AND MANNER OF MOVEMENT. INDICATE COMPARISONS WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR AIRCRAFT.
The object was dark in color, round in shape, and seemed to be hovering about 25 to 30 feet from the ground. It had a faint glow around the edge, and would occasionally dim and then brighten again. There was no sound that I could hear. It hovered for about 5 minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared within seconds. I could not see any wings or landing gear, and it did not resemble any aircraft I have ever seen before.
