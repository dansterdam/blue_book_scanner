Dear Sir:

A report is being made at the advice of USAF Colonel James E. Hunter, Chief of the Los Angeles Office of Information.

On the evening of July 13, 1964, at 10:35 (within two or three minutes), I saw an object hovering about 10 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be about 2 degrees in diameter or about the size of a penny held at arm's length. The object had a silhouette distinctly shaped much like a waterdrop. The object was lighted in a manner somewhat like the transverse axis of the object. The object would have been 3,250 yards or less from my observation point. The object remained motionless for about five seconds.

I first noticed the object through the tinted portion of my windshield. As I was parked facing the south, the object came into my vision area. It was parked facing the south, the object came into my vision area. It was parked apparently in a hover. As I glanced at it, it started to move off at a great rate of speed and went out of sight in about ten seconds in a northern direction.

From the relative positions of the tinted windshield and my eyes, I could estimate that the object had been some 300 to 400 above the horizon. Although the object I observed was in the Southern sky, and drawn out the actual occurrence took place very quickly. I doubt if any photographs were taken.
