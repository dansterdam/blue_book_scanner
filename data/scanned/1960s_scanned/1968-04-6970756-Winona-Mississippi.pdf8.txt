The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a handwritten document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I shall proceed to extract and output all the text present in the document:

postoffice right end of road
ounse. Traveling eastone slight southeasterly direction. No one was
reported near the scene at the time. However, there was a strong odor
of gasoline in the area. The object was circular in shape,
had a neon-like glow, and was silent in operation. It appeared to
hover approximately 20 feet above the ground for a period of 15 to 20
minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous
speed and disappeared from sight to the northeast.
Checks were made at the scene, but no trace of any landing
or physical evidence could be found. Nothing unusual was observed
in the area prior to or after the sighting.
Attempt is being made to interview additional witnesses
in an effort to obtain more detailed information. This report
is being submitted for your information and evaluation.
