My Dear Sir:

Perhaps you have already received letters about this, but I had not been aware that I was an eye witness until advised by Mr. ______ on June 16th.

On approximately June 16th or 17th, I was walking my dog at about 10:00 p.m. As I was approaching my residence on ______ Avenue, suddenly in the southwest sky I saw a very bright light or object which appeared to be travelling toward the northwest. It did not have the characteristics of an aircraft, but seemed to be a very large, brilliantly lighted object or source of light, and traveled without sound or visible form.

I watched it closely then, and saw that it came to a point near the horizon and then reversed itself and traveled back toward the southeast. It did this twice in the space of about 3 minutes. At no time did it come into the cone of light from the street lights or any other light in any way. 

Then suddenly the searchlight beam was not addicted so that its path could be traced. It just disappeared, and I never saw it again. I then continued my walk without seeing or hearing anything further.

It was planned, as nearly as I can describe it, as the disc and bottom of what appeared to be a concave saucer. Its color was a uniform white, but very brilliant and intense. And it seemed to be illuminated from within so that there was no projection of light from it or shadow upon the ground. It traveled without sound, without apparent propulsion or any visible means of navigation. It simply seemed to move under its own power, and then without seeming effort it would reverse direction.
