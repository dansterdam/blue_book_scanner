The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document, but the page itself is blank except for a handwritten caption at the top which states "July 1, 1960, Blossom, Calif. Several witnesses reported seeing an object like a half-disk over an area for several minutes. The object appeared to have lights on it and was moving slowly."
