I have seen satellites all kinds of jets at all hours all types of Aircraft. I have seen meteor and as I said before I have been with Astronomy for ten years.

I reported the sighting the same evening. 
First I called the Alleghany Airport tower (control)
Next: I called the Pittsburgh Press and ask if anyone had reported an object. 
Then: I called the Buhl Planetarium which they in turn gave me a story about a weather balloon, not like this did.

I hoped I have helped in some way with this report to you.
