The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The document appears to be a letter from the "Dept. of Unidentified Flying Objects Pentagon Building" in Washington, DC. The letter discusses the writer's personal experience observing "red lights moving very slowly over the hood" and a "cigar shaped-rocket like" object. The writer states that they "will try to copy what I saw on a paper" and concludes with "THANK YOU".

WASHINGTON, D.C.

DEAR SIRS:
I REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE LETTERS OF THIS SORT EVERY DAY, THINGS OF THIS SORT THAT COULD BE KNOWN ON MY PORCH WHEN I SAW RED LIGHTS MOVING VERY SLOWLY OVER THE HOOD. I WAS LOOKING FOR A PAIR OF BINOCULARS AT THEM. WHAT I SAW WAS A CIGAR SHAPED-ROCKET LIKE NOT SEE THE CIGARET SHAPED THING ON THE THREE RED SHAPES. WHEN I SAW I WONDERED IF I SHOULD REPORT THE WAY THE CIGAR SHIP INTERCEPTED THE ONE THING TOOK PLACE ABOUT 15 MINUTES. THE CIGAR SHIP IS THE MATTER OF THIS IT WILL TRY TO COPY WHAT I SAW ON A PAPER.

THANK YOU
