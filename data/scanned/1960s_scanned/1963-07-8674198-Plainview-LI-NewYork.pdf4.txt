There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a document, specifically a letter dated July 30, 1963 from Major Mason M. Jacks of the USAF Office of Information to someone named Mr. P. in Plainview, New York. The letter references photographs that were previously sent and provides some additional details about them.

Dear Mr. P.

Reference your letter with photographs to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, now the Foreign Technology Division.

You numbered the figures on the photographs and identified them. Your conclusion is that #1 is a satellite, #2 is a flying missile, and #3 scratches are native.

Your photographs are attached.

Sincerely,
MASON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
Office of Information Division
