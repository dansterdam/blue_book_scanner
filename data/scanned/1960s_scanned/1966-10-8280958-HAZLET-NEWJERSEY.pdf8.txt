Transcribed text from the document:

Observer noted object in the west southwest at shortly after night. Object appeared to be moving very slowly. Observer watched object for several minutes and object being still visible. Observer went back outside about 0100, 6 Oct 66 to look for object. 

At this time object had moved slightly to the right and downward. Object had moved about 6 inches from original position. White was the predominant color observed. At 0300 observer again tried to locate the object but at this time object had disappeared.

Observer was questioned about sighting. She thought it might have been a satellite. She had never seen a satellite previously. Movement puzzled her and then when she went back outside at 0300 the object disappeared she became concerned. She wasn't reporting an UFO just an unusual light.

CONCLUSION
Witness was more than likely observing the star Altair. At 0015 EST Altair was on an azimuth of 268 degrees and at an elevation of 15 degrees. At 0100 EST Altair was at an azimuth of 275° and at elevation of 8° at 0300 Altair would not have been visible to the observer because it set at approximately 0200 EST. Altair being bluish - white star appears to be what the observer witnessed.
