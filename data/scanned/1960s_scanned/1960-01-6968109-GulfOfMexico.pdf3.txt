Dear Major Friend:
With reference to the anomalous radar sighting of which I took a transcript, I have checked with some of our astronomers and find that this sighting is a statistical phenomenon. In order to clarify this matter, I would like to know whether the radars had any range readings. Also, it is important to know whether these large surveillance or acquisition radars on the ground in the neighborhood. It is possible that there was a meteorological condition at the troposphere which was scattering from a powerful ground radar. In this case, the radars on the plane would have observed a blip, but they would not have been able to get a series of range readings on it. Thus this information is rather crucial.
I will await further information from you on this before I take up the matter with ATIC.
Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
Associate Director
