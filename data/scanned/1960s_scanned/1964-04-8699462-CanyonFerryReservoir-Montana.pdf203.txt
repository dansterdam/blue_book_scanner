The provided image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. As an OCR system, I will proceed to extract all the text from the document:

"During flight, at 5:48 PST, my attention was attracted by a bright yellow-orange light in the eastern sky, which appeared to be about 5-10 degrees above the horizon. This light seemed to be stationary and did not blink or move in any way. I observed it for about 10 minutes and then it gradually disappeared, seeming to fade out. There were no clouds in the sky and the weather was clear. The light did not appear to be connected with any known aircraft. I have observed many aircraft in the past and this light was unlike any aircraft lights I have ever seen. It was a steady, bright, yellow-orange light, with no blinking or flashing. The light did not move or change in any way during the time I observed it. I would appreciate any information you may have concerning this sighting. Sincerely,"
