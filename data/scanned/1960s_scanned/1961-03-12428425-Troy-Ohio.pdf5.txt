Dear Mr. Heise:

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter
of 4 January requesting a speaker for the Troy Rotary Club
during the month of February on the subject of unidentified
flying objects.

I am endeavoring to obtain a suitable speaker for you
on this subject for one of the open dates mentioned in your
letter, and I will let you know as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
