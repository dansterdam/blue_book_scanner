Dear [REDACTED],

Reference your letter reporting an unusual object sighted on October 10, 1966. With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to confirm such a sighting. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting should have been included. If you had reported your observation to the Air Force in October 1966, an evaluation would have been possible.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

I have attached some material on this subject which I think you will find interesting.

Sincerely,
GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
