Lakewood library on flying saucers and some of them have found wonderful books on this subject. The books will be returned and we would like to get them for ????????? ?????? for a little while longer and we hope you will come back as we have a wonderful selection. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE RETURN THESE BOOKS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AS THEY ARE REALLY WANTED TO GO BACK ON THE SHELVES. WOULD YOU PLEASE RETURN THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE? THIS IS A DESPERATE APPEAL AND WE WILL BE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR COOPERATION.

PLEASE RETURN THEM AT ONCE AS THEY ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. THIS IS NOT JUST SOMEONE'S WHIM BUT A REAL NEED. PLEASE DO THIS. THEY TELL US THAT THEY MUST HAVE THESE BOOKS BACK AND WE WILL SEND THEM TO WHOEVER WANTS THEM WHEN THEY ARE RETURNED.

Please try to hurry. I think we are all goings nuts. books will help us understand things a little more.
