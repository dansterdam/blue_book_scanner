The image contains two photographs. The top portion of the image shows a compass-like diagram with the cardinal directions labeled. The bottom portion of the image shows two sketches, one depicting a person standing on a road or path surrounded by hills or mountains, and the other showing a distant landscape with a road or path leading into the distance.

AS PER STANDING ORDERS, YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT FIRST APPEARED. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH OBJECT FLEW OR MOVED.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION WHERE LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE AND SPEED OF THE OBJECT. ATTEMPT TO SCALE YOUR SKETCH TO YOUR ACTUAL VISUAL ESTIMATE OF DISTANCE COVERED. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
