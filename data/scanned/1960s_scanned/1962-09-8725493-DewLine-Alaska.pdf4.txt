Twinsburg, Ohio - 3 miles west on Rte 82.
Two "pulsing" lights were seen within a short distance of each other, by 2 reliable observers for a period of about 5 minutes. The first sighting occurred from a position across the field - the second from a position near the PAFB first sighting. The object appeared to be disc-like and was estimated to measure about 15 feet in diameter. It was hovering and maintained a fairly steady altitude of about 25-300 feet above the horizon. The object then began to increase in brightness and size and seemed to be approaching directly overhead, estimated to be almost directly overhead, and was estimated to be about 75-100 feet in diameter at this time. Speculation that it might have been some kind of aircraft or missile on test, but the time and direction seemed to rule out such possibilities. Duration of sighting 2 - 2.5 minutes.
