On the evening of Aug 18 a bright silver object was observed moving slowly across the sky from the north to the south. The object appeared to be approximately the same size as the full moon and was pulsating with a brilliant white light. At times the light seemed to flash or blink. The object was observed for several minutes and then disappeared from sight. 
It appeared to be very high in the sky, much higher than any aircraft I have ever seen. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this and I am quite puzzled as to what it could have been. I am a mature adult, not given to imagining things, and I am quite sure of what I saw. If you have any suggestions as to what this phenomenon could have been I would be most interested in knowing. 
The incident was observed by several other people in the area, including a Catholic priest and his housekeeper. All of the observers agree as to what was seen. I would be glad to furnish any further details that you may require. 
Sincerely,
