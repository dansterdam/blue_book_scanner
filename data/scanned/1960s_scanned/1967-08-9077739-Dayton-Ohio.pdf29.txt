I have had several experiences like this and would like to look at them further. Stars on a clear night, like might in a cup saucer. And long sky this, any motion. I have sighted many satellites and echo was like an old moon glowing. Do not seem like any regular action on another satellite or bird but at night came he or like, I have seen nothing like this before. That is why I reported my sighting.
33. When and in what position were you when you first observed this object? 8:25 PM
