The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

The text in the image reads:

"Project Blue Book

During the latter part of April of this year I had a chance to photograph an object which appeared to be over for investigation. If there is any further information you would please contact me.
