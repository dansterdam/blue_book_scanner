The text of the letter is as follows:

Harrington, New Mexico
Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in answer to your letter of October 15, 1964.

I am happy to be able to verify for you the newspaper report quoting the Air Force as saying that the object you saw was simply ball of fire and told without any intent to perpetrate a hoax. The story was indeed told by an Air Force intelligence officer, but he did not say. It seems to me that we had no evidence that would justify a conclusion that an inter-planetary vehicle had been observed.

We did further confirm that we made the investigation to which you referred, and we had no evidence that would justify a conclusion that anything beyond earthly phenomena was involved. We do have a few sightings like the Socorro sighting which are disturbing, but the great majority are easily explained as conventional phenomena. It would not be responsible, in my judgment, to jump to the conclusion that we have inter-planetary visitors.

However, I do look carefully into such cases to attempt to find out what the physical evidence can reveal. If a significant number of such sightings show definite evidence of the presence of extraordinary things, we should indeed look into the matter very carefully. For the present, we should look for natural explanations which, in turn, could lead us to the extraterrestrial hypothesis if the natural explanations prove untenable. But we should keep an open mind and avoid premature conclusions.

Please feel free to get in touch with me directly, please ask your psychiatrist friend to write to me so that I can get in touch with him directly.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
Director
