MARKSVILLE, LEESVILLE, COLFAX, LA.
1. Date of Sighting: May 8, 1962
2. Date of Report: 5-10-62
3. Time: 5:53 p.m.
4. Duration: approximately 20 minutes
5. Description and Location:
Three persons, Mrs. X, Mrs. Y, and Mrs. Z, were standing in their front yard in Marksville, Louisiana, when they observed a bright metallic object in the sky to the east. It was shining brightly and was stationary. After about 5 to 10 minutes the object began to move very rapidly to the south and disappeared. The object was about the size of a full moon. The three witnesses were interviewed, and statements were obtained from them.
6. Weather at Time of Incident: Clear, visibility 50 miles.
7. Investigator's Comments: This appears to be a legitimate sighting. The explanation for the high velocity and disappearance of the object was that it may have been a satellite or meteor, although it was very unusual in its behavior.
