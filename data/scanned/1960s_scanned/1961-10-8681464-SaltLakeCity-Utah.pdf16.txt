The image does not contain any photograph. It is a page from an old UFO report document.

And were there any features you got from manned aircraft such as vapor trail or anything?
Nothing whatsoever.  It was suspended there.  It wasn't even moving.
And you didn't hear any sound during this time?
No sound; the only thing that I actually heard was the pilot talking to us on the radio that he had it in sight and he was trying to get close to it.
Could you estimate the angle or elevation?  Altitude?
At that distance I would estimate, just guessing, I would say 2500 ft above the ground, just guessing; that is quite a distance.
2500 ft altitude? 
Yes, above the ground. 
Is that 2500 or 25,000?
2500.  And at times it was lower than that and at times it was a little bit higher than that, but it didn't stay in one position - it seemed to go different directions and up and down, back and forth.
What direction would that be from the office here?
Due South.
With regard to flight path, did you see it move at any time?
I did not see it move.  If it would have been moving, it would have been moving away from us, but like it would go out of sight and then the sun would hit it and we could see it for 5 or 10 minutes and it would be in a completely different place.  It would go different directions.
But at the time you were viewing it you couldn't determine any direction of travel?
No, not unless it was going away from us.
How long did you watch this?
About 15 minutes.
15 minutes.  Did you watch it until it disappeared?
Yes, I did.
Did it travel at that time or did it just fade out?
It just faded out.
