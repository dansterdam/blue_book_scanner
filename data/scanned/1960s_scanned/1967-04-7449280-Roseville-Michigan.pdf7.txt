The image does not contain any photographs. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

Statement, included at Blue Book, to the effect that the subject was not moving except when the witness would travel in an automobile. It is believed the object was stationary and only vibrant, almost as vibrant as the automobile was approaching me it had only vibrant red light that was visible, which reacted to the light. Witness "knows the object, or that I've ever seen with red lights that were as vibrant or brilliant".

Finally, witness became frightened because object appeared to so close and then disappeared and there was no sound at all. Unless one is willing to call this an absolute hallucination, that there was no physical outfit present whatever, the "aircraft" simply won't hold up.

This case is sufficiently interesting for me to interview the witness, as there were more details to gather one as stated. I made this personal investigation and report later.

I would agree with the evaluation of possible birds, but I suppose to be fair we should also add, possible unidentified (data insufficient, no follow-up). The card indicates one object, and observed flying in V formation. This actually strengthens the "possible birds" evaluation.

Since the 164 was not returned the evaluation "insufficient data", I suppose to entirely concurs. But the case itself is interesting in that there were 13 witnesses. Here is one case the Condon Committee should have looked into it particularly since there were 13 witnesses. Also the object was visible for 12 minutes, and it was observed through binoculars. Though also the object was worth a closer look, as a matter of fact, when I am in Boulder this July I will look into it myself, but for the statistician, the evaluation "insufficient data" certainly holds.
