THIS RE-ENTRY REPORT
"Sustained after the re-entry them, with Glenn. At the same time, other slickly surface a shield began to hold the shield to the capsule during the re-entry. He knew by the hissing sounds of the scapes, but he hoped that the shield would stay in place. In a space of about 15 seconds, the capsule reached speeds so intense that his body was visibly hammered by g-forces far above the human tolerance. Life or Death. Glenn took the tremendous forces with extraordinary stamina. He made the difficult decision to try to jettison the shield. As he did so, the shield flew off, but not before it had scored the surface of the capsule around the window. Glenn could feel his body beginning to be scorched. He tried to lift the shield back to its place, but the forces were so great that he could not. The heat became apparent that something was terribly wrong. Glenn said later, "There were large areas some 5 to 6 inches wide and 12 to 15 inches long that were completely charred." The heat was so intense that it seemed as if the capsule was on fire. Glenn could smell the intense odor of burning metal and felt the heat intensely envelop him. On the ground, Astronaut Alan Shepard, the capsule communicator (CapCom), was growing increasingly alarmed at what was happening. "The chute's were disintegrating and it appeared that Glenn's capsule was going in fiery plunge."
