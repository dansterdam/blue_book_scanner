2. Visibility was excellent, a bright moon light, and not a cloud in the sky, which was clear and lighted as day. The observer that notified this office states that the object or whatever it was he observed appeared to be about the size of a small aircraft, about the size of a fighter plane or a large private plane. He stated it was travelling at a very high rate of speed and he estimates its altitude was at least 3000 feet. It was flying in a straight line and was observed for approximately 6 seconds. The observer does not believe it was an aircraft, and his attitude is that whatever it was, it was not a conventional aircraft or helicopter. He stated two small tail lights were visible, and that is all the detail that was observed. That is we can tell of its physical features. No colored lights were mentioned, and it made no sound at all. It was moving so fast that the observer states he could not make out its shape clearly, and he is simply unable to give any more details of its physical appearance. He feels, however, that it was some type of aircraft, but not a conventional type.
3. The observer is considered to be reliable and trustworthy, and his report has been accepted as a serious matter. The incident is considered to be of sufficient importance to be reported to you.
