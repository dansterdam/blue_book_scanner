Belmont, California

On March 20th, two astronomers in Belmont, California, spotted two sets. Both saw a flaming object appear behind the constellation Pisces. Then a second object appeared behind Orion, halted, shifted into position behind the first object, and then both UFOs moved off with incredible speed, south-bound.
