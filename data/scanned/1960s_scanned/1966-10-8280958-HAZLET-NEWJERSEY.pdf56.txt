Proposed reply to letter from Jaimie Boone, 12 March 1967

Dear [redacted],

Reference your [redacted] letter reporting an unusual observation by you and others on 10 October 1966. With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation to the Air Force in October 1966, an evaluation would have been possible.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. 

I have enclosed some material in this reply which I think you will find interesting.
