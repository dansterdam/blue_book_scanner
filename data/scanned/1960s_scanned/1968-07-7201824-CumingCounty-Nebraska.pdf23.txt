The witness was observed a large circular object in the sky from about 2250 to 2300 hours on 7 July 1968. The object was described as silver in color, about the size of a small airplane, and emitting a pulsating red light. The object moved at a high rate of speed and then came to an abrupt stop. After a brief pause, the object again moved rapidly and then vanished. The witness could not provide any other details.
