The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten diagram and text. The diagram shows a sketch of an object with some annotations. The text describes the diagram and mentions that it "shows the outline of my neighbor's movement and confirms my past observation of the same objects as were seen again on Thanksgiving night this last Thursday".

Text extracted from the document:

It looked a giant 5 or 6 times larger than a star as a gigantic disc of metal that it could not move a rattler.

This diagram shows the outline of my neighbor's movement and confirms my past observation of the same objects as were seen again on Thanksgiving night this last Thursday.

Thank you.
