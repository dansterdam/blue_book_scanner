ARGENTINE NAVY
DISCLOSES IMPORTANT
UFO CASE

An official Argentine Navy UFO report, labeled one of the most important Argentine UFO cases, contains information in connection with a mysterious event that occurred near the Rio Gallegos, Argentina region on December 15, 1962, according to the report.

During the night of December 15, 1962, says the official report, a large UFO (unidentified) was sighted from the deck of the vessel. The huge UFO was round-shaped, and it was moving at great speed. It displayed no lights, and made no sound. As it approached, the needles of the ship's magnetic compasses "suddenly and simultaneously" swung off course, pointing toward the UFO.  The power which caused this disturbance was so strong, the report states, that the UFO was 2,000 meters (well over 1 mile) away from the ship. 

The transport commander radioed the Commander-in-Chief of the Argentine Navy. The Base Commander was so concerned that he accompanied the Hydrographic Service instrument experts to the scene. They found no electric or magnetic effects other than those caused by the presence of the UFO.

No magnetic instruments survived the disturbance, which experts determined was strong enough to affect the operation of the ship's engines, as well as equipment on board submarines and military and civilian aircraft, leaving the UFO undeterred.  

According to C.R. Dicani, whom the Secretary of the Argentine Navy appointed to investigate, several reports on the incident have been forwarded to NICAP.

Lt. Col. Pacini also forwarded a summary of 1964 UFO cases (Argentina) to the Argentine Government, adding that fifteen 1963 reports already are on record with the Navy. NICAP will try to report the best cases as soon as space permits.
