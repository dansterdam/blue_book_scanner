EXPLANATION
On 8 December 1964, at 1840 EST, a luminous object was observed by the crew of an aircraft in the vicinity of Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Maryland. The object was first observed at an azimuth of 020 degrees and elevation of 30 degrees, moving in a northerly direction. It then changed direction to the northeast and accelerated rapidly, disappearing from view in approximately 30 seconds.
The object was described as being 3 to 5 times the size of a star, pulsating and rapidly varying in intensity. No definite shape could be determined. The weather at the time was clear with visibility extending to the horizon.
Analysis of the reported sighting indicates that the object was probably a satellite or meteor. No conclusive evidence exists to substantiate the reported observation as an extraterrestrial vehicle.
