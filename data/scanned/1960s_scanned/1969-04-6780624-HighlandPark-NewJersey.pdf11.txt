DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL A MOMENT, THEN MOVE AWAY? 
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
FLAME OUT?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

Approximately 15 minutes looking around with wife planning a backyard gathering.

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Gradually disappeared, wandered and went behind trees.

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
