Subject of this report is the sighting of three unidentified objects in the sky over Cleveland, Ohio, on 8 July 1961.

The primary witness is XXXXXXXXX, an aircraft mechanic with XX years of experience. XXXXXXXXX was on his way to work at approximately 0430 when he observed the objects through the windshield of his automobile. He watched the objects for approximately 3 minutes before they disappeared from view.

XXXXXXXXX described the objects as being circular in shape, with a bright orange color. He estimated the size of the objects to be approximately 20-25 feet in diameter. The objects were observed to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet and were traveling in a straight line at a high rate of speed, estimated to be about 600-700 mph.

XXXXXXXXX stated that there was no noise associated with the objects, and that they did not leave any trail or exhaust. He also indicated that the objects did not appear to have any external markings or structure, and that the orange color appeared to be emitted from the objects themselves.

According to XXXXXXXXX, the objects were sighted over a populated area of Cleveland and were observed by several other witnesses, including a Cleveland Police officer. However, XXXXXXXXX was unable to provide the names or contact information for any of the other witnesses.

XXXXXXXXX reported the sighting to the Cleveland Air Force Base, and was subsequently interviewed by USAF personnel. This report summarizes the findings of the USAF investigation.
