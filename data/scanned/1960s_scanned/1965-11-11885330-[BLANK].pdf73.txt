The image appears to contain a diagram or schematic illustration. It shows a graph-like representation with various labeled components, including "Chamber electrodes", "1450 kV", "50 nsec", "90% Ne, 10% He, 1.1 atm", and "40 cm". The diagram seems to depict some kind of technical or scientific information, possibly related to electrical or energy-related processes, but I cannot identify or name any specific individuals or entities shown in the image.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is:
