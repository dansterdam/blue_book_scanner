SAP-OIC/Miss Turney*/76526/Feb. 16, 1968

Dear Mr. _____, 

Your letter of February 14, 1968, to the Secretary of Defense
has been referred to this office for reply.

Unfortunately, information, we cannot offer on an explanation
of the unidentified flying object (UFO) you encountered. If
you will enclose your technical data, photographs, and any
other information, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon
as possible to the nearest air force installation. We are building
up our files on UFO sightings to aid in the eventual
investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, we are enclosing you some literature which may
help you identify your sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the
Air Force.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
