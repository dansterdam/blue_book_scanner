Major B. Quinn Farrill: 
Re: Evaluation of U.P.O.
photo of 17 Feb., 1957.

Dear Major Farrill:

This is in reference to my report of the evaluation of the U.F.O. photo taken on 17 Feb., 1957 from Villanova University.

I appreciate that you feel that I should a bit more clear in my evaluation of your original photograph. I wanted to postpone the submission of my evaluation because it is a complex study and will require me to make a careful and thorough analysis before giving you my final conclusions.

However, I understand your desire to have a prompt response so I will proceed with an initial evaluation for you now. I would like to advise that this may be subject to some revision later as the multiple exposures necessitate a careful analysis which takes some time. 

The exposures are multiple because of the overlapping frame outlines. Many rolls of negatives indicate this multiple exposure phenomenon. This fact alone would make a definitive interpretation difficult. I am concerned also that the "saucer-like" object which you consider the U.F.O. may actually be an artifact caused by the multiple exposure in the process.

I must advise that on the basis of the evidence before me, I cannot state with certainty that a definite U.F.O. is shown in the photograph. However, I would not want to rule out the possibility entirely without a more complete analysis. I would suggest that you consider the scientific aspects of the case rather than the sensational. Please know that I will be as thorough and objective as possible in reaching my final conclusions. I appreciate your patience and understanding in this matter. Thank you.

Sincerely,
