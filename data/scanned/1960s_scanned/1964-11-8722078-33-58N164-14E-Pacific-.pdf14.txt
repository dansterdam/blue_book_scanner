There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing only written text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

Longmont, Colorado 
Deputy Sheriff Walt Turner, while on northern direction with A.C. Dunbar, at 9:37 p.m. on 27 November 1964, saw a brilliant white object traveling from south to north. The object was about 20 degrees above the horizon in the north. As the object was disappearing, it made a sudden turn to the east and disappeared from view. The object was also seen by Deputies Chuck Wanke and Hune Chambers who were cruising in a patrol car.
