The image contains two sketches. The larger one appears to be a compass with 16 directional points, labeled with cardinal and ordinal directions. The smaller sketches appear to show a person standing on a road in a landscape with mountains or hills in the background.

6A. WHEN PLOTTING THE POSITION OF A PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, PLACE A "N" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO 
THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "0" AT THE POSITION 
OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "0" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE OF THE 
PHENOMENON. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
