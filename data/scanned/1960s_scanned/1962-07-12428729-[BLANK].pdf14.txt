Dear Mr. Chairman:

I refer to your letter of 3 July 1962 requesting the latest Air Force position on unidentified aerial phenomena.

The Air Force position on this matter is that unidentified flying objects/phenomena are in determining if they are in any way a threat to our national security or if they are a source of new scientific or technical information. Further, the Air Force attempts to determine the cause of each sighting in order to allay public anxiety resulting from an incident involving unidentified phenomena.

Better than 90 per cent of the more than 7,000 cases investigated since 1947 have been attributed to the misidentification of such familiar objects as balloons, aircraft, and satellites, and such unfamiliar phenomena as parhelia and mirages. A small percentage of cases remains unidentified due, for the most part, to the limited nature of the report. To date there has been no evidence from any case to indicate that these objects/phenomena are any type of space craft other than earth satellites or space probes of the Soviet Union or of the United States.

In the United States there are more than fifty private unidentified flying object (UFO) organizations. Collectively, these organizations boast more than 500,000 members. During the 1960 Presidential election, the members of these organizations actually nominated their own candidate who allegedly threw his hat into the ring.
