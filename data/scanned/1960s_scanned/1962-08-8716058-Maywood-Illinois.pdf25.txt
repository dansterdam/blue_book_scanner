Light Over Baltimore
On the first of August, 1962, Mr. and Mrs. P---- of North Point Road, Dundalk, witnessed a meeting of Millwright County near the entrance of Dundalk Avenue, a portion of Baltimore County near the intersection of North Point Road, and went to the top of a hill near the North Point Road. When they looked up and saw a light, larger than the glow of the moon, hanging above the entrance to Dundalk Avenue. The light remained stationery for periods of two to three minutes, and then moved quickly back and forth along the entrance of Dundalk Avenue, and to a point some two hundred yards to the north. This movement was repeated at irregular intervals of every two to three minutes, lasting for a few seconds, and proceeded to a point, extinguishing around 9:15 p.m. until about 9:25 p.m. when it disappeared. A bit earlier, a couple who were also driving in the vicinity, reported that a large, bright object was seen to move from the north and seemed to land or touch down in the vicinity, where the stationary light was observed, and then receded in the same direction toward the north, and was not visible but for a brief sight.
