The image contains a sketch diagram and a compass rose diagram. The sketch diagram shows the observed position of an object relative to the horizon and provides instructions for how to determine the observed altitude and azimuth of the object. The compass rose diagram appears to be a reference for determining the direction the object was moving.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
