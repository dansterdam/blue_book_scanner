STATEMENT
SUBJECT: Reported UFO 
1. At approximately 0103Z, a Mr. from North Carver called to report that he described the object as having 3 revolving beacons (as opposed to flashing or Crimes type), one red, one green and one blue. In addition to the this object, three (3) smaller ones in a step formation trailed behind and had the same description as the larger item. This group were reported to be moving slowly across the trees. This formation was located SW of Carver. Mr. reported observing this group (Estimated Altitude 5000'-6000') for 20 or 30 minutes and was sure they were not aircraft of any type he had ever seen. At 0102Z, the Base Operator was instructed to transfer the call to WOC, WOC  did not receive the call. The control tower did not observe the object and did not see or hear any aircraft in the local area. I asked the witness if the aircraft had flown between his (Mr. ) position and the object's position. He stated that the aircraft's sighting was simultaneous with the objects' sighting. He further stated that the aircraft had a flashing light. He mentioned the object SW was still there and mentioned at one point during the sighting that BOSTON SEARCH CONTROL TOWER, RAPCON, etc. were called for possible information. Houston Search Control Tower then called the turn control local police, who confirmed the objects but did not identify them. At 0512, the Tower then called an aircraft in local area and asked if they would mind flying in the local area for unusual sighting. The aircraft reportedly he could see nothing out of the ordinary. The witness still from the same general stating that the stars are stationary and the objects were moving.
2. Other Factors:
a. Tower and Falmouth Police reported shooting star at 0003Z, 3 May.
b. There was a helicopter flying in vicinity of Carver (Tower had no contact with it) (Quonset verified all their helicopter were on the ground).
c. Several groups of stars and/or planets were visible low on the horizon at the approximate heading given by Mr.
