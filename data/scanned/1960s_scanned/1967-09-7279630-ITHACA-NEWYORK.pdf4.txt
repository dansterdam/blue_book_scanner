Dear Sir:

The following information is forwarded for your review.

The actual sighting occurred on 21 September 1967, however, it was not possible to obtain the attached infrared photos until 6 February 1968.

The Kemper Brothers, Inc. of Waverly, Ohio were the source photographing specializing in infrared work. The equipment used was a Minive, Autolair 35 Camera. Settings were 1/50 second, ASA 400 Ektachrome film. The filter used was Kodak wratten "A" filter, number 25. He developed the film but is reluctant to release it (1 suspect the quality is marginal). Mr. Fletcher tells me tha: the film is quite dark and he is reluctant to release it to be shown publicly.

Sincerely,

SIGNED
LINDSAY A. HAYES, Capt, USAF
