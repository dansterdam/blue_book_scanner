The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a text-based document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
1 July 1968

SUBJ: Physical Specimen, Cypress Gardens Florida, 2 June 1968
