As I viewed the object, it seemed to be oscillating from side to side and to rise and descend at irregular intervals. This indicated to me that it was under intelligent control. I noticed that as the object came closer and closer to the horizon, it seemed to gradually diminish in size although I felt that it was in reality increasing in distance from me. I could not hear any sound from the object at any time, nor did it appear to have any visible means of propulsion. Its distinctive feature was the very bright, glowing object appearing to be emitting light rays as opposed to the illumination of reflected light. I would take the time to advise someone immediately in the future should I be so fortunate as to observe such a phenomenon again. Enclosed please find my business card.
