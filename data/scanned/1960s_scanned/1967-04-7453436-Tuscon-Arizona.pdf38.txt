We watched the object about 30 seconds. It was a bright light, steady, no blinking or flashing. It appeared larger than a star, but smaller than a planet. It was travelling in a straight line at a steady rate of speed, not erratic or jumping in any way. We watched until it disappeared below the horizon, approximately 10 or 12 degrees above the horizon.
