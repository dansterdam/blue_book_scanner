Dear Sir:

I have been very interested in the account in the Chicago Tribune of March 25-26 telling of lights seen over a swamp near Dexter, Michigan. 
I am wondering if this letter is to you because, like I, you are interested over this phenomena.

I suppose this little doubt that this manifestation is known as "will o' the wisp" - from the Latin "ignis fatuus" and it should excite little attention except for its beauty.

I have seen these lights many times when I was a child. We were in a boat on a deep swampy body of water which was an over-flow from a creek, and they surrounded us. A slight floating, shimmering body of water which was an eerie and frightening sight.

If you will look in the dictionary under "gas" you will see that the lights are due to phosphorescence that comes over the marshes. There never was a second accompanying these lights, but it may be that we were never taken enough to note.

What fantastic things this mortal mind can conjure up when the unusual presents itself!

Very truly yours,
Ethel A. Kending Pauli
