Photographs of Satellite Decay
Fairborn, Ohio 45324
1. Reference your observation and subsequent photographs of the 7 March 1966 satellite debris decay. We received nearly seventy reports, but as far as we know, you are the only one who photographed this decay.
2. We are interested in making some photographs from your negative; if possible, we would like to borrow it for this purpose. If this is feasible, please complete the inclosed photographic material release and duplication (which will take approximately one month) we will return your negative along with one enlarged print.
3. Thank you for your assistance, it is sincerely appreciated.
