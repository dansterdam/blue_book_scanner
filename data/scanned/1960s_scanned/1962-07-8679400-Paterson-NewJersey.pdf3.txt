There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing text describing an observation.

This is the text from the document:

This is the story of how we saw it. My friend and I were turning the corner when one of the people said to me "was that ever the satellite, it's sure close." I said "no, that's no satellite, it's a UFO and it's over the hospital." We watched it for about 7 or 8 minutes. It seemed to be hovering or just bobbing up and down, and would suddenly take off or dart off to the right and left. We couldn't for the life of us figure out what it was. When it got about 1/4 way across the sky it seemed to blink out. We both saw it and are convinced that it was not a satellite or airplane or anything else we have ever seen. This is a rough drawing of what we saw that night.

Enclosed is a rough drawing of what we saw that night.

List of observers are:

There are 10 observers listed.

6 Coy. Joe James, checking on this, reported the following: He said that a man who was on 33rd street in that area said that he did see some strange object in the sky and it did do the things described above. He said that the man lives on or near 33rd street but he could not get his name or address from him for obvious reasons.

I would appreciate any information you could give me on this incident.
