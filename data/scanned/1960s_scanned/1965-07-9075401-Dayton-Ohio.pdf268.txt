Landing in France
At 5:00 on the morning of the 1st of November 1954, a farmer of the Valensole region, near Marseille, France, left his home on his tractor to go to his lavender field. When he arrived at the field, he began to see the flowers, then his attention was attracted by an object which seemed to fill the whole countryside. He walked around the object on four metallic feet which was approximately 3.5 meters away. The object had an oblong shape like a big football. 
The farmer describes that the object had a dull, flat, lustrous finish, and had a dome on top of it. The object was poised on four metallic feet "so which was attached to the central block."
What interested Mass was the presence near the machine of a being that appeared to that of an eight-to-ten year old child. The "little man" was working an a orange-colored control box on the object, but was unaware or headless of the farmer's presence. Inside the object, because the small door was open, Mass was able to see the same object inside. The object then took off with a "deafening whistling" sound, the same as had first attracted his attention. Mass witnessed the object ascending at very high speed without any visible sign of smoke or dust. 
Mass informed the authorities at Valensole that the site of the landing was located some 200 meters from his home, a hole of 20 centimeters deep and two meters wide was found in the field where the marks indicated that some thrust or reaction motors had been. The dirt where the central pivot had been was turned around and hardened. The surrounding soil was, however, normal.
Investigations revealed that no normal aircraft had been in the area.
