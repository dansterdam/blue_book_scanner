SPACE SHIP LANDS NEAR GLASSBORO
GLASSBORO, N.J., Jan. 19 - A strange space craft landed in a wooded area near here last Friday night, according to several residents who reported seeing the object.

Michael Rasmowitz, 13 (eight), accompanied by Capt. Philip J. Cardavelle, of Glassboro police, visited the scene and here is their report:

GUY PAYS $10 COURT COSTS FOR 
SPACE LANDING HOAX

The 13-year-old perpetrator of the Glassboro, N.J., 'space landing' hoax was charged in juvenile court and paid a $10 court costs for his prank at the time, police said.

Capt. Cardavelle said that the boy had rigged up a light and sound effects to simulate a space landing, attracting a large number of curious spectators. The boy later admitted the hoax when confronted by police.

Capt. Cardavelle told how Rasmowitz had led him and others to the scene, which was in a wooded area, where the boy claimed a 'spaceship' had landed. However, the captain said, a close inspection revealed only a light and sound device.

Cardavelle said the boy's 'spaceship' apparently consisted of a battery-operated lamp and a hand-cranked sound effects device. The captain said the boy had become something of a local celebrity as a result of the hoax.
