A sudden feeling came over us, especially since we were the only people on the street and in the only opening we saw. We had the feeling it might become and become a little afraid. Then we drove to the northeast, turned right, and continued for about a half a mile. There was perfect silence, but we managed to continue from a slight instinct. When we were near the car, we completely surprised when the large object came from behind us and passed over us approximately 500 feet. It seemed like a somewhat shiny object and passed over us again. We could see no lights. Manure could see no one inside.
