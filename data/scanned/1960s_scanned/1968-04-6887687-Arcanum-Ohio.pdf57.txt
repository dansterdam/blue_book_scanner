NICAP MASS SIGHTINGS UFO REPORT # 68-26 (continued)
Sheet 4
Which of necessity was viewable to the car's passengers, seems to this investigator, Considering further that his husband's death occurred a recent (i.e. two) two years before and that his statement most certainly an understandable, 'tends to discredit this sighting as a possible "illusion",' understandable, tends to discredit this sighting
as a possible "illusion".

Cona By~Chairman Raymond Fowler
I have already commented on the reasons why perhaps no one else reported the object, as the cars apparently got near to the next turn, where the lights of the nearby town, under the present night conditions, masked its visibility. Any reason as to explain the object and the associated noises due to an illusion, brought on by personal grievance for a husband who died a ago is at a best highly subjective and improbable in light of all the reported details. It is possible but only remotely improbable.

CHAIRMAN'S EVALUATION
The overall factors associated with this sighting, and the fact that crock place occurred within Middlesex County, Massachusetts, prompt me to place this sighting in the "unknown" category.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman
