A search in the Hoffmeister-von Niessl Catalogue gives several fireballs of about same date and similar radiants. These are:
No. 334, 1899 Sept. 8
greater V
No. 335, 1872 Sept. 13 great
No. 336, 1901 Sept. 14 greater V 
No 340, 1902 Sept. 27 greater V
No. 372, 1906 Sept. 27 greater J
No. 375, 1914 Sept. 8 d x V

When we remember that probably not one in hundred has it with computed, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a record of many hundreds of fireballs.
Evidently the end of the 1956 fireball fits in quite well.
It is indicated that Prof. V.P. Fedynsky, Abastumani Planetarium, East Lansing, Michigan, has computed data from pre-sumabably different reports.
FIREBALL of 1967 APRIL 5.52 G.M.T. 
A.M.S. No. 2392
This brilliant fireball appeared in the above date at 7:34 p.m., E.S.T. It seems to have started about 15 miles S.W. of Rochester, N.Y. and ended above a point very near Barrie, Ontario. Lt. Lilienthal stated that the end point is quite accurate. The path-length seems to have been about 40 miles. Data on this event has 24 reports. from Canadians and U.S. The fireball was clearly seen by H. E. Poth, Project Director, URANOLITE PATROL Circuit, National Air Lines, and Us Canadian staff, Barrie, Ontario. But for the invasion of both, no solution would be possible. We received only one report from a ground observer. This came in New York. and one from a 170-lb. man. The initial and terminal points seem to have been widely scattered points.
The fireball was very brilliant and observers were almost unanimous in giving its color as yellow-green.
Very few stars could be seen during the event for most Canadians. The observers reported that it was brighter than the Moon, and more or less equal in brilliance to Venus. Probably about of the apparent diameter of the Moon.
Calculations indicate the terminal height is 46.5 km. From the measured apparent angular velocities (0.74 deg/sec) and durations (7.5 sec) the height of beginning and end points is estimated. Retaining estimates which are in quite close agreement, we find the height of H2 to be 69.7 km and the height of the end at 46.5 km. The velocity in the velocity is 41 km/sec. This indicates a hyperboilic orbit. But due to the large apparent size in duration, it seems possible to speculate that the object may have broken into smaller fragments near the end, just before the final complete disintegration, but by the calculated data. Due to the great height of H2 the chances of finding meteoritic remains is small.
