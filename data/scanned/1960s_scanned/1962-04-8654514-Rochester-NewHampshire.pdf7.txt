The shape of the object or objects is not clearly defined, as the drawing shows a vague, unclear depiction. There are no exhaust trails or vapor trails labeled in the sketch.

The edges of the object or objects are described as "Fuzzy or blurred".

There appears to be more than one object depicted in the sketch, as the question asks "IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?" and the drawing shows multiple indistinct shapes.
