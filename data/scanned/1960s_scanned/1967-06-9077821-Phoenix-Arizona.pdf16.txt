Text transcribed from the document:

I am a student of 9th grade level, in Phoenix, Arizona. I am interested in astronomy and meteorology.

On August 15, 1964, at 9:15 p.m., I observed a bright light moving in the sky over Phoenix, Arizona. The light was maneuverable and appeared to be circular in shape. It was visible for about 5 minutes before disappearing.
