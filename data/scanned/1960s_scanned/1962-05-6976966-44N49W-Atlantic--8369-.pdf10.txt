The image appears to show a black and white photograph of what looks like a radar or sonar display. There is a circular display with radial lines and concentric circles, as well as some numerical markings on the edges. This appears to be an instrument or device used for detecting and tracking objects, likely in the context of the Project Blue Book UFO investigation.
