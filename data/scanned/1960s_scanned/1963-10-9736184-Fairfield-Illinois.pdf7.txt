The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be an envelope with handwritten text and a postmark. The text on the envelope reads "Woodrow Franklin / Illinois / U.S.A." and the postmark is dated "Urbana, Illinois", but there is no other text visible in the document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is:
