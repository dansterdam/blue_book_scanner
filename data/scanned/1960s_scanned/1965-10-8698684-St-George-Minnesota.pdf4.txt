UNCLASSIFIED
PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 65-59
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
LOCATION: VICINITY NEW ULM, MINNESOTA
DATE: 23 OCTOBER 1965
PHOTOGRAPHY: ATTACHED (2) KODACOLOR NEGATIVES AND (2) PRINTS
QUALITY: GOOD
PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 65-134, submitted by Major R. Quintanilla, USAF/UFO for an analysis of the attached negatives and two prints.
ANALYSIS: The setting for the photograph of the alleged UFO was 1810 hours, 21 October 1965, in the vicinity of New Ulm, Minnesota. The photograph depicts a probable circular shaped object on the negative.
The lack of a definitive signature to the light spot and the dense background completely devoid of objects of any kind, preclude an interpretative type analysis. Further, the identification of what could be made from the information provided, cannot be determined conclusively.
The following comments in reference to the negative/prints and information furnished are given in support of the aforementioned negative analysis:
a. The one negative furnished is a copy and all probability, not processed by Kodak Laboratories. Kodak uses only color intermediate film (Type 5270) for transparencies. Further, the source letter indicates the original photograph was shot with Ektachrome film whereas the reproduced negative furnished shows Kodacolor film.
b. The reproduced negative furnished does not show a frame marking around the photographed area. It is extremely unlikely that a camera exposed negative will fail to show a frame marking.
