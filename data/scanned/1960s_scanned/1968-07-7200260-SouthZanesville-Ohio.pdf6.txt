The image contains two sketches or illustrations, but no photographic image. The larger sketch appears to be a compass rose or navigation diagram with directional labels. The smaller sketches depict an individual standing in a landscape with a saucer-shaped object in the sky.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A CIRCLE AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. THEN, DRAW ARROWS INDICATING THE MOTION OR DIRECTION OF TRAVEL OF THE PHENOMENON, AND NOTE THE ELEVATION AND AZIMUTH OF THE LARGER SKETCH.
