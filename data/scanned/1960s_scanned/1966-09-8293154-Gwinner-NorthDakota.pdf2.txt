The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch shows a compass-like device with a curved line and a series of angles labeled, as well as instructions for the observer to follow. There is also an additional space for the observer to draw the motion of an object or objects.

Now, as an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. On a separate paper, draw a picture that will show the motion of the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
