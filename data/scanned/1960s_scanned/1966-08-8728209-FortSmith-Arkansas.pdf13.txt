Saucers, Planes or Stars?
Sky Something
Fort Smith reported skyward lights as 'something'
(Continued from page 1-A)
"Like a star" but only one light was seen. They were smaller but appeared closer than stars as they danced way overhead. 
Capt. James Kelly, informations officer at the Little Rock Air Force Base, said that their radar did not pick up anything in the sky that night.
Apparently they saw some-thing there that was not aircraft coming and going over the city.
Capt. James Yetor, information officer at the Little Rock Air Force Base, informs there is no record of any sightings of unidentified flying objects in that area by Air Force personnel.
A number of persons in the city described the lights as "saucers, planes or stars?" and the information was relayed to the Air Force, said Smith Police Chief Gene Baker.

"We didn't see anything, and our radar didn't pick up anything," Baker said.
Stacy, a resident of the area, suggested there were thousands of calls concerning the sighting and a considerable excitement followed the reports.
"They said there were sightings of bright lights in the sky," said Baker.
"Whatever it was, it was seen by an enormous number of people and caused considerable excitement," he added.
They still believe in a sky-appearing something, said Stacy. 
"We've had no reports of anything from the Air Force or anyone else," Baker said. "It was something seen in the sky by a number of people, but we don't have any explanation for it."
