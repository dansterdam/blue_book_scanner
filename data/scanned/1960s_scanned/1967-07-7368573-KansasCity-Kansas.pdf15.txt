MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting of 3 July 1969
23 MAY 1969 
1110 hrs EDT
Called Lt Col Mercier 
Richards-Gebaur AFB
Ext. 2668/2102

1. Col. Mercier stated that he did talk to Mrs. and that he had submitted this report to the 325th Fighter Group. The object, according to the witnesses, was about the size of a small plane. 
and the driver said that the object had exploded somewhere between his home and the dirt road where he had seen the object for a short time while driving home. Col. Mercier stated that there was some farm land to the south. He felt that if an object as described by the witnesses had exploded, it would have been seen by others and reported to the police department or the Col. Mercier, both of whom at least looked at the area where this explosion reportedly took place. Col. Mercier did think there have been a light plane which was landing at the State Line Airport, a small airport that is located on the Missouri-Kansas border. However, since the night manner of the sighting, he did not feel a small plane had landed at about the time of the sighting. He also stated that the sighting had been on the Missouri side of the area.

2. Col. Mercier stated that at the time he submitted his report to the 325th Fighter Group, the group was in the process of deactivating.

3. He also stated that he had recently received a letter from Washington, D.C. requesting that he try to locate the records of the sighting. He was unable to do so and has submitted his report to this office in Washington, D.C.
