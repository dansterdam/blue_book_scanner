Transcribing the text:

On the 30th of April, a dispatch out of Canberra said that a sphere had "definitely been identified as part of a space vehicle" it would not be "an ordinary satellite."
Australian Health Minister, told the House of Representatives that the sphere was identified as part of an Italian Satellite. (Australian Supply Minister)
The press release divulged the fact that the government had not located the sphere which was described as 16 inches in diameter and weighing 12 pounds.
It was said to be "stainless steel ball" on which a valve had been turned into a fused mass, apparently as a result of reentry into the earth's atmosphere.
It is interesting to note that to this metallic makeup of that first sphere has not been reported on any previous report. Further description or clarification of the physical characteristics of the sphere is needed. This could lead to a more thorough analysis of this object which was found in South Africa in early 1963.
There was no death that this object came from the fuel tank of an Atlas rocket. There was no doubt that this object, is both strange and peculiar. No more reports have been received concerning the reason that the Australian spheres have not been identified.
The press release states unequivocally that the sphere has been discovered by Russia and the U.S. Then where?
