The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Bob:

We have finally returned from the wars to home base. The trip back was a bit wearisome and accompanied under considerable tension since my youngster developed a splendid case of tonsillitis which drove his temperature to 103 and better. As you can imagine this can be quite trying, but fortunately we found a Doctor who promptly shot the little lad in that well known area with penicillin. This did the job and he is now as chipper as a squirrel.

Please accept my thanks, Bob, for your unstinting assistance and help during my stay in Dayton.

I have not as yet had an opportunity to discuss with Mr. Karth the results of my trip, but I am certain that previous decisions have not been changed. Today the Chairman confirmed his previous decision that hearings will be held on UFOs during this session of Congress and no specific date can be set for this as yet.

You and I breathe a deep sigh of relief. However, as you can imagine, the "planifies" have begun their clamor, stimulated by notices in the press of our committee's interest in UFOs.

If anything new develops I shall let you know.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
