REMARKS:
THE OBJECT SIGHTED WAS VERY LARGE AND BRIGHT, MUCH BRIGHTER THAN A STAR OR PLANET. IT WAS SEEN BY SEVERAL PERSONS OVER A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE. THE OBJECT WAS SOLID AND TRANSPARENT. IT MOVED AT A VERY HIGH SPEED AND WAS VISIBLE IN DAYLIGHT. SEVERAL OBSERVERS SUGGESTED THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A HIGH-ALTITUDE AIRCRAFT. HOWEVER, ITS GREAT SPEED AND BRIGHTNESS WOULD SEEM TO RULE OUT THIS POSSIBILITY. THEREFORE, IT APPEARS THAT THIS WAS SOME TYPE OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
