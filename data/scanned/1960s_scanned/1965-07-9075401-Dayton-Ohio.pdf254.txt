The image does not contain a photograph, only text on a questionnaire form. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract and output the text from the document:

24. Date you completed this questionnaire:   Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific point questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
