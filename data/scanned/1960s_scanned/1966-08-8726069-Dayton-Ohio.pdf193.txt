There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The image shows a form with questions, and the text can be transcribed as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:        Day        Month        Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
