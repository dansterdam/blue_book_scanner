NEAR SALEM, VIRGINIA - APRIL 7, 1967

On April 7, 1967, at approximately 8:00 P.M., Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Darr, who reside on a farm near Salem, Virginia, observed a strange object in the sky over their property.

Mr. Darr was outside doing some chores when he noticed the object hovering over a field about 100 yards from the house. He called his wife to come and look at it. They both watched the object for about 15 minutes. 

The object appeared to be round or circular in shape, about 25 to 30 feet in diameter, and surrounded by a hazy, blurry light. It hovered silently over the field, then suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared from view.

Mr. and Mrs. Darr were both convinced that what they saw was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. They described it as a "strange, unidentified flying object."

This incident was reported to the local police department and the United States Air Force, which was conducting investigations of UFO sightings under Project Blue Book.
