UFO APPROACHES BRAZILIAN AIRLINER

A Swissair airliner, while approaching Rio de Janeiro International Airport on 14 December 1960, was approached by an unidentified flying object. The object was observed by the pilot and co-pilot, who described it as a bright, round object with a metallic appearance, which approached the airliner from below. It maintained a constant speed and altitude relative to the airliner, remaining off to one side, until the airliner broke through the overcast.

The object was observed for approximately 8-10 minutes. During this time, it made no sudden maneuvers, but maintained a constant course, speed, and altitude in relation to the aircraft. When the airliner broke through the overcast, the object disappeared from sight. There was no evidence that the object had emitted any exhaust or caused any interference with the airliner's radio or other equipment.

The pilot and co-pilot filed reports of the incident with their company, but no further action was taken. The report was eventually forwarded to the U.S. Air Force, but no additional investigation was conducted.
