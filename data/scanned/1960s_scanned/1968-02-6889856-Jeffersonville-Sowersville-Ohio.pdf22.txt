The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch depicting two simple shapes - one labelled "White" and the other "Green/Blue". The text below the sketch asks "What was the angular size? Hold a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a street lamp or moon, and find how much of the object was covered by the head of the match. What fraction of the phenomenon would have been covered by the match head?"
