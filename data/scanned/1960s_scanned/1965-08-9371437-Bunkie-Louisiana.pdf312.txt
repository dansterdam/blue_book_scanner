There is a photograph present in this image, which appears to be a sketch or drawing. The sketch depicts two views of an unidentified aerial object. The first view shows a curved shape with rays or trails emanating from it, suggesting some kind of movement or trajectory. The second view shows a more detailed landscape scene with what appears to be a person or figure in the foreground observing the object in the sky.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:
