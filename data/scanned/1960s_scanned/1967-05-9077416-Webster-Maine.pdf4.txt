THERE IS ONE LAST FACT I FAILED TO MENTION, ON AND ON THE TAIL END OF THE UFO WERE LINED UP ABOUT DRAFTS' EXCEPT FOR THE RIGHT ALONG ONLY ONE . NOTED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT.

I HOPE SINCERELY THAT YOU GIVE THIS REPORT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, FOR I FEEL IT TO BE IMPORTANT, AND DON'T WRITE IT OFF JUST AS A "USUAL EFFORT" SEEN UNDER UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR NO "USUAL" OBJECT COULD HAVE DONE WHAT I SAW, AND IF YOU THINK THE HOAX" WHICH I ASSURE YOU ARE NOT. THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER FACTS I COULD RELATE ABOUT, SO I WOULD LIKE IT IF YOU WOULD SEND ME A QUESTIONNAIRE THAT I COULD FILL OUT.

I AM AN AMATEUR ASTRONOMER, AND I AM USED TO NOTING UNUSUAL DETAIL. I WILL ENCLOSE A GENERAL FLIGHT PATTERN, WHICH WILL NOTE SPEED AT DIFFERENT POINTS.

THANK YOU.
