Before we left, we called the retiring president of
the School of Mines, who had nothing further to offer. Before
our visit with Captain Holder, on coming back from the site, we visited
a who lives fairly close to the sighted landing
place, and maintains that he heard no loud roar and has remained skeptical
about the whole thing. He claimed that if there had been an explosion
such as claims to have heard, he certainly would have
heard it. However, this does not necessarily follow, because was
directly down wind from the gully, there was a very strong southwest
wind blowing, and the gully is on the opposite side of the hill from where
was listening. This, of course, can make a tremendous difference
in ability to hear. Further, there are trucks passing along the highway
quite close to house, and he undoubtedly is used to hearing
backfires, and truck roars of one sort or another. He was the only person
whom we talked to, however, who tended to disbelieve veracity,
indicating that it probably was a hoax. This solution is not accepdata to
the present writer, because there are just too many bits of evidence that
militate against this hypothesis.
