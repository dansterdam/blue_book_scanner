The image does not contain any photograph. It is a textual description of a "Bright Sphere Near Home In Me." The text describes an event that occurred on September 24, 1963, where a bright spherical light was seen from the front porch of a Mrs. James Patterson's home near Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The light was observed by a total of three people, and the text states that the object disappeared after the witnesses saw the light.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:
