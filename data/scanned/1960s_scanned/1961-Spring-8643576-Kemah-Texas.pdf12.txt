Mrs.: [redacted]
SAFoICo/731b/9 Sep 65 

SEP - 9 1965

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you could not identify in 1961. The object which you observed is similar to an observation of a metallic, stationary or oscillating object reported from other areas. The characteristics of the object observed and the disappearance over the horizon was a matter of concern. However, in many instances, the probability is that such objects may be caused by a variety of natural or man-made phenomena. The reflection of the sun's rays on the ice layers reflecting the sun's image is one of the possibilities. Such objects may appear between the ice layers reflecting the sun.

Thank you for reporting your observation.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. SPAULDING
