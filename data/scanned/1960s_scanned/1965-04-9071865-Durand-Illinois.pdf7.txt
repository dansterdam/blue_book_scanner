Dear

We have our report for our observation of the night of 15 Apr 65. We observed 2 or 3 objects in the sky towards the south west horizon. They were very bright and looked like they were oscillating from side to side. At times we could not see them but after a short while they reappeared. We would like to receive them and would ask you for that night's observations.

Sincerely, 

MAJOR GILLESPANIA, JR
Chief, Aerial Phenomena
