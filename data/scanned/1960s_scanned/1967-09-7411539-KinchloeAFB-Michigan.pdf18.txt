1. Reference your telegram of 28 September 1967.
2. My original message should answer the majority of 
your questions.
	a. Time the UFOs were sighted? The times of the 
16 UFO sightings are listed in my message.
	b. Movements? These are all stated in my message.
	c. Time on scope? All targets were on the radar
scope for 20 to 60 seconds. The strength of these 
target returns were equivalent to a B-52. The blips on 
the scope was somewhat larger however.
	d. Speed? The speed of the UFO targets varied anywhere between 150 and 2000 mph.
	e. Noise? None. The UFOs were not visually observed.
3. Dr. James McDonald and Dr. John Ahrens of the University of Colorado are here at Kincheloe investigating the incident. They arrived Sunday night and will fly to Detroit later today. They may be able to answer most of your questions better than I.
