There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed report or document from Project Blue Book regarding an incident that occurred at Clear Lake, Maine on 5 October 1960. The text describes the incident, including that an unidentified flying object (UFO) was reported, and that an investigation was conducted but no physical evidence could be found to corroborate the original report. The document discusses the investigators' findings and their inability to substantiate the reported UFO sighting.

The text of the document is as follows:

1. The following is a summary of an incident reported to have occurred at Clear Lake, Maine on 5 October 1960.

a. The original report stated that an UFO fell to the ground from a craft that was observed making a landing. Two days later, Lorting AFB, sent an ECG team to the scene of the incident. After closely inspecting the ground over, and probing for possible foreign objects, nothing could be found to substantiate the original report. After questioning the people at the scene, it was found that no one actually saw anything fall to the ground and no one was found near the scene. The one who reported seeing something falling on the ground stated that "it sounded like a thud" and he was the one who called some items falling on the ground.

b. The investigators could not find a hole as reported, or any object that was not supposed to be there. An attempt was not made to try to locate the source of the alleged explosion. This is not an AF responsibility. A good possibility is that no such incident occurred in the direction of the buildings and the noise heard was a building material landing.
