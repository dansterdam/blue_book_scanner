I HAVE OBSERVED SEVERAL NAVAL AIRCRAFT USING THE
NIGHT FLIGHT WHITE SERVING IN THE AREA I GAVE YOU A BRIEF
DESCRIPTION OF LAST YEAR ONE OF THESE AIRCRAFT POINTED OUT TO
ME AN OBJECT THAT WAS TRAVELING AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AS THE
AIRCRAFT ITSELF. THIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE SOME SORT OF ARTIFICIAL
LIGHT, AND BECAUSE OF THE MANEUVER'S THAT WERE CARRIED OUT BY
THE AIRCRAFT WHILE TRACKING THIS OBJECT, INDICATES THAT IT WAS
NOT JUST A STAR OR PLANET. ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE
PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
