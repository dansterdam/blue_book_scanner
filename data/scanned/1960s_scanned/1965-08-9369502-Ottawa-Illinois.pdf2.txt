There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a letter response to a report of an unidentified aerial object observed on August 17, 1965.

The text contained in the document is as follows:

Dear Mr.
This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you observed and were unable to identify on 17 August 1965.
The object which you observed has been evaluated as a satellite, not a satellite as you suggested. Satellites have been artificially placed into orbit on which observations are made and calculations are made on their rate of flight.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. SPAULDING
