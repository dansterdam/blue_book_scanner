Mrs. Illinois

Dear Mrs. Illinois:

Your recent letter to Prairie Farmer has been forwarded to Chanute Air Force Base for our reply.

We are not experts on this matter. By any means, however, believe that there is no harm directed with the folk. belief that the sightings in no way be dangerous to living creatures.

If your installation, fell, I suggest that you contact the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Washington, D.C.

Sincerely,

GEORGE W. OGLES
Lt. USAF
