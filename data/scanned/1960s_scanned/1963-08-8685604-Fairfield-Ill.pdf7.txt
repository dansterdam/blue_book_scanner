Is this an object of a physical nature or do you consider it to be some type of energy field?
If it is a physical object, what are its properties as determined by your laboratory analysis?

What radioactive count can be detected on the exterior than the interior? 
When this paragraph is my standard "Form" paragraph I always insert where stated "your name" and disregard the rest.
