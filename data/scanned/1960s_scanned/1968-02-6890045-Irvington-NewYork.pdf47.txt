DATA COVERING PHOTOGRAPHS

The enclosed color photographs were taken by the writer on the afternoon of February 24. The camera used was a Pentax Spotmatic. 35 mm film, Vivitar 135 and 28 lenses were used for extreme closeups.
The film used was Kodacolor X. Shutter speed was 1/125 second. Lens stops ranged from F8 to F5.6.

The ice sample shown in the photographs belonged to Mr. ____ (name redacted), whose house is south and close to the gravel pit area where the object was sighted. The ice sample had been kept in the Jackson's freezer since being taken from the pond at about 5:00 pm, Sunday, February 18.  

Photo #9 shows the sample viewed from the front surface (the side exposed to the air). The dark spots are pockets or crevices of extremely fine dirt or grit imbedded in the ice.

Photo #10 and #13 show the details of the surface seen in #9 above. (Note: The orange tint is probably due, for the most part, to the wood underneath the ice.)

Photo #8 shows the bottom view (water side) of the ice sample. Bread-like crusts from the surface are visible as yellow flocks in the upper left hand quadrant of the picture. The long lines running over the surface were made by the plastic bag and partial melting of the sample.

Photo #14 shows a detail view of the bottom surface of the sample.
