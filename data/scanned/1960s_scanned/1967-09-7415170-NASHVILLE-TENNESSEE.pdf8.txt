September 23, 1964

Major Hector Quintanilla
Project Blue Book

Dear major Quintanilla,
I am writing to inform you concerning two U.F.O.'s which I observed on the night of September 21, 1964. The objects were observed through 7x50 binoculars and were large and bright. And were sighted in the Nashville area just after dark, approximately 19:30 PM. The objects remained stationary for over an hour and then suddenly darted away at a high rate of speed.
The report is being submitted to you for any action you may deem necessary. The objects traveled at a very fast speed and then suddenly stopped. It is assumed that they were under intelligent control as the speed and maneuvers were far beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. But I assure you that this report is not motivated by any type of sensationalism. I am simply reporting what I actually saw.

P.S. There were 3 other witnesses of these objects.
