Dear Colonel Martini:

Your request regarding UFO observation of August 25, 1967, has been received.

A review of our file indicates that the aircraft which do have blinking lights were in the area at the time of the report.

I hope this will assist you in this matter.

Sincerely,
George Kintz
Chief, Rochester Airport Control Station Tower
