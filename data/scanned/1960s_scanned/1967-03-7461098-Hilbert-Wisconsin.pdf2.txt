Did not see the main object, it came and left quickly. I saw 2 beams from my house about 20 feet tall and bluish white in color. At first I thought it was a light shining from somewhere, but then I realized it was not like any light I had seen before - a big bright beam, not from any searchlight. It stood straight up from the ground.
