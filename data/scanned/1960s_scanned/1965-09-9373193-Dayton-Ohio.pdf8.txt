The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains questions and instructions related to describing the movement and direction of observed objects.

Text extracted from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are looking at the horizon. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "S" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place an "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
