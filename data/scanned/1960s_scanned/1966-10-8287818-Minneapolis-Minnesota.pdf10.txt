Dear Mr. *****:

This replies to your letter of January 7th in which you forwarded the photo of the unidentified flying object (UFO).

The Air Force is very interested in this photo. Although we understand this is a poor-quality shot, would you please check with your brother again and see if they were unable to take a better photo. We would appreciate receiving the best print.
We would certainly like to have the original negatives. It will be returned undamaged upon completion of our analysis and we will notify you of the results.

Thank you for your letter; we hope to hear from you again soon.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
