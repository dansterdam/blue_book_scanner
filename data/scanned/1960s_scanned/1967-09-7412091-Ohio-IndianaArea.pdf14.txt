UNITED AIR LINES
O'Hare Field Station, P.O. Box 8775, Chicago, Illinois 60666

January 8th, 1968

Dear Major Quintanilla:

In regard to your letter (undated) recently received with reference to a UFO Observation on September 24h, 1967, I am enclosing a copy of report number #385 which appears to fit the location and time you describe in your letter.

The NORAD file with regard to report #385 indicated that there was no known TIP (tracking and impact prediction) ready for that location at that time.

The SAO (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory) file for this report indicated that this event was a meteor or fireball entry into our atmosphere.

This does not of course, rule out the possibility of a piece of uncontrolled debris re-entering the atmosphere and causing the event that you describe in your letter.

If there is anything further that I can help you with, do not hesitate to write.

Sincerely Yours,
H. E. Roth, Project Director
Volunteer Flight Officer Network
