Schwartz at Crandy Technical School in Chastes, Michigan. The letter acknowledges Mr. Schwartz's letter of August 15, 1966 concerning an unidentified object in the sky at night. The letter states that the U.S. Department of Defense has established a special office to receive such reports, and provides the address for the Chief, Community Relations Division, Office of Information, Department of the Air Force, Washington, D.C. 20330, where Mr. Schwartz will likely hear from them in due time.
