NICAP POSITION PAPER

GOALS, AIMS, PROGRAM: The basic NICAP goals are to gather, evaluate and disseminate reliable information about UFOs, and ultimately to bring about a full scientific investigation, making use of instruments and the full resources of the scientific community.

Policies and methods are established by a Board of Governors (see list) and implemented by the executive staff.

To achieve the goal of scientific investigation, NICAP has:
(a) Established field investigation units and affiliates across the country;
(b) Obtained the volunteer services of scientists and other qualified specialists to assist in investigations and evaluations in the U.S. and foreign countries;
(c) Made materials available to Congress and the press;
(d) Urged a Congressional inquiry;
(e) Published our findings and evidence in the "UFO Evidence", a documentary report of over 200,000 words.

OFFICIAL NICAP POSITION ON: Interplanetary UFOs -- The idea that UFOs may be extraterrestrial in origin is considered a reasonable hypothesis worthy of the most urgent consideration. Furthermore, it is the opinion of many individuals associated with NICAP that this is the most likely explanation of UFOs. However, all theories have been and will continue to be carefully considered.
