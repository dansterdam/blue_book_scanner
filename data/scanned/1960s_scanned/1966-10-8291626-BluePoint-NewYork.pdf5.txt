The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document that includes a section for "Physical Evidence" and a weather report questionnaire.

Physical Evidence: Were photographs taken or was any physical evidence of the object left behind? (Note: If the caller says there is physical evidence still present, contact Wing Operations Duty Officer through CAC, Ext 493, or the Air Police, Ext 408, immediately).

Weather: (Observer(s) account of weather conditions)
A weather report questionnaire follows, with sections for surface, wind direction, and velocity in knots and degrees.

THIS IS THE END OF QUESTIONS FOR THE OBSERVER. RECORD ANY OTHER COMMENTS HE MAY WAIT TO ADD. THERE MAY BE HIM (HER) FOR CALLING.
