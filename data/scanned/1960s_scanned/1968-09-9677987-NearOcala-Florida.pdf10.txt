Orleans to pick up a passenger. We left there on instruments. However, the weather cleared by the time we were to Pensacola; this was on Sunday and they gave us permission to go across the restricted areas of Eglin and along the shoreline. We stayed just on the north edge of, I believe that's war zone 470 there; whatever that is in the Gulf there. We had just passed the northeastern corner of this and Jacksonville Center gave us permission to turn to the southeast; as I recall our heading was about 120Â°, and I don't sidled any object which I assumed to be a jet, probably a trainer they're are lots in that area, you know. We watched it. As I recall we were at an altitude of about 9500 feet. I believe that's correct. We watched this thing; I watched it for, oh, five minutes, I guess.

H Pardon me. When you say "this thing", could you be more specific with it. Was it light or was it...

C Well yes, it was a pale green flashing light. It was flashing at a little more than, a little slower rate than the average aircraft red rotating beacon. It was a pale green color.  

H In terms of brightness of a star, was it brighter th or dimmer than...?

C It looked very similar, if you were observing an aircraft landing light, I'm sure you've watched, I would say five miles, five to eight miles. Something like that, except that it had a green tint to it.

H Did it have any extension to it, or was it a point source?
