The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

CINCINNATI, OHIO - 30 AUG 61. (Approximately 9:00 PM) Dozens of Cincinnati residents (Approximately 200-300), very "slowly" toward the southwest. It suddenly exploded "like a great white light". This brightness scattered in various directions.

A spokesman at Greater Cincinnati Airport rejected the possibility that this incident was a local sighting. The Cincinnati Weather Forecast Office offered no explanation. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Wright Patterson AFB, ruled out moons, stars, and other space phenomena.

On the first incident, the object (9-10 miles above) appeared the same time as the second time, though witnesses closer to the object heard a soft "explosion-like" sound during a 10-15 second period when the object began to break up which indicated a sudden loss of containment pressure. The object was between 5,000 and 10,000 feet high.

The 17 Aug 61 sightings were quite similar in nature: six more days passed and at 8:57 PM, 11 Sep 61, CUFOR member Ann Bellik (who lives in the above sighting area) reported a light, hovering approx 1,000 feet above the ground, which blinked out. Although similar in appearance and direction of movement, some obvious differences appeared in the details of the sightings that might have presented a false impression. Mrs. Bellik and her husband intend to maintain vigilance and report any further sightings. Anything gleaned from this operation will be reported.
