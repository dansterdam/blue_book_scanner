To: Lt. Colonel Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

1. Enclosed is the record card for the case referenced above.

2. Unfortunately, my plans for a trip to Cincinnati fell through and so I did not have an opportunity to further discuss the matter with Mr. and Mrs. ____ . However, I expect that either on a future trip to Dayton, or independently, I will have occasion to be in Cincinnati at which time I would like very much to interview the witnesses in person. I am not satisfied with the lack of details in their report as described in the descriptive material. The vagueness persists after my personal interview, I would like to change the evaluation from "unidentified" to "insufficient report" but at the moment I do not have sufficient cause to do this.
