There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 15 July 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: Lights appeared, appeared, appeared.
