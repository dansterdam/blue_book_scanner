MAY I IMAGINE YOU ARE SEATED ACROSS THE BOARD OF THE EXAMINING BODY. PLACE AN IMAGINARY X AT ANY SPOT ON THE COMPASS ROSE FOR COMPARISON WITH WHERE THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE IN RELATION TO THE OBSERVER'S POSITION WHEN HE LAST SAW THE PHENOMENON.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW PLEASE MARK AN X AT ANY POINT ON THE LANDSCAPE WHERE AN OBJECT WAS REPORTED, AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE ITS DIRECTION OF FLIGHT FROM THE OBSERVER'S POSITION WHEN LAST SEEN. NO MATTER WHAT THE PATH OF FLIGHT, IT MAY BE STRAIGHT, CURVED, OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS PORTION.
