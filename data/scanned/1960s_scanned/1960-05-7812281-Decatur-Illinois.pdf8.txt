Output of the text in the document:

"It is still a mystery as to what occurred on that evening. The object apparently was in sight for at least 15 minutes and at times was quite close and stationary. The object seemed to be about the size of a car and to have a peculiar glow around it. It made no sound and moved with a slight wobbling or rocking motion rather than in a smooth, straight line. The object was first sighted over a heavily wooded area near Decatur, Illinois, and it moved rapidly and changed directions several times. Toward the end of the sighting, it headed South and was lost to view.

The witness, a retired Air Force officer of many years experience, was quite shaken by the experience. He stated that he did not feel the object was explainable and was quite different from any conventional aircraft he had ever seen before. Despite his long experience, the witness was unable to make any intelligent estimate as to the identity or nature of the object. All he could say was that it was a very strange and puzzling phenomenon.

Very sincerely, [REDACTED]"
