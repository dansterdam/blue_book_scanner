OBJECTIVE OF THIS EXTRACT OF THIS SIGHTING IS TO ASCERTAIN IF THE OBJECT OBSERVED COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE KNOWN CONVENTIONAL AIR CRAFT/SATELLITES OR NATURAL PHENOMENA WHICH COULD HAVE PRODUCED THE REPORT AND RELATED PHENOMENA REPORTED BY THE OBSERVER.
ACCORDING TO THE SIGHTING REPORT, THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT HOURS. FURTHER INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE OBJECT WAS INITIALLY OBSERVED AS A BRIGHT CIRCULAR OBJECT WHICH LATER BECAME SMALLER AND CHANGED SHAPE. THE OBJECT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE MADE RAPID CHANGES IN ALTITUDE AND SPEED.
OBJECT IN THE NIGHT WAS OBSERVED TO EMIT BEAMS OF LIGHT. OTHER REPORTED PHENOMENA INCLUDED RADIO INTERFERENCE AND MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES.
BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THIS SIGHTING CAN BE READILY EXPLAINED AS A CONVENTIONAL AIR CRAFT, SATELLITE OR NATURAL PHENOMENA. THE REPORTED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT AND THE ASSOCIATED PHENOMENA DO NOT MATCH ANY KNOWN CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATIONS. FURTHER INVESTIGATION MAY BE WARRANTED TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THIS SIGHTING.
