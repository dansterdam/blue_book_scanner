The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, likely a response letter addressing the submission of unusual photographs for analysis.

Proposed reply to letter from:
Dear [redacted],
Reference your unusual photographs which were forwarded to our office for detailed photographic study. 
Photographic analysis revealed the following: slide #1 is a normally exposed good quality transparency with one water spot or chip in emulsion, probably caused by processing. Slide #7 may also be a good transparency, highly magnified. It may also be some object or reflection of some shape other than shown, but made to appear as two lobes with high lights and shadows caused by the extent of our focus. The higher the magnification, the more focus can alter the image's size and shape. The image on slide #7 could be of an object, a light source, or a reflection of a light source. Any identification from the submitted photographs would be only speculation.
Your interest in Project Blue Book is appreciated.
