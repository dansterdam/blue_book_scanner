The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a UFO report document. The text describes an event where a couple in Washington observed a bright object hovering over a lake on the night of April 3, 1965. The report describes the object's appearance and the witness's observations.

Waiting Light In Washington

"It was like a Science fiction thing you see on TV," said Donald Peterson of Seattle, Washington, of the object he, his wife and another couple observed while staying at the Peterson's cabin on Whidbey Island, Washington.

On the night of the 3rd of April 1965 the two couples were outside when they heard a wailing noise like a dog howling. "It is usually so quiet up there that we noticed it at once," Peterson told reporters later.

Peterson first saw a reflection in the water, then looked up and saw a bright object apparently hovering over the Lake in the direction of Recreation and Crescent. He looked at it through a rifle scope but could see no details because of its brilliance. Peterson then shot his rifle into the air to see if that had any effect. It apparently did't. Fifteen minutes later the bright object disappeared, leaving clusters of different-colored lights behind.
