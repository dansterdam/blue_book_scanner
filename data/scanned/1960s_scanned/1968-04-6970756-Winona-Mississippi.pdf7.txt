TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

The night was passing normally, but around 10:00 - 10:30 p.m. a peculiar light was seen, apparently hanging stationary or moving very slowly across the sky. It was a rather pronounced illumination or glow, although it did not resemble the appearance or lighting characteristics of an aircraft or a helicopter.

The light moved slowly and irregularly. During the time of observation, it did not appear to extinguish or disappear, but simply faded out of sight. It brightened at times and dimmed at other times, moving in an erratic manner.

It was not the appearance or lighting characteristics of an aircraft or a helicopter. The night seemed calm and clear. The light was out in the open sky, about one-third the distance up to the horizon.
