It appeared colorful and quite sizable, much larger than an ordinary object. At first it seemed solid, but later it appeared to break up, becoming like a cluster of lights or gas discharges. The object did this gradually and disappeared. The entire sighting lasted about 20-30 minutes, I would estimate.

Apparent color, size, and shape changes over this period indicated that this was not a solid object. It did not resemble any known aircraft. I felt somewhat puzzled and concerned about what I had observed.
