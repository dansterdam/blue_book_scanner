The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter dated July 2, 1956 from George J. Freeman, Jr., Lt. Colonel, USAF, Chief, Civil Branch, Community Relations Division, Office of Information, responding to an observation report.

The full text of the document is as follows:

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Thank you for your recent letter regarding your observation on March 22, 1956. Observations such as yours make our job much easier in identifying the stimulus which causes such phenomena.

From the information you supplied, an aircraft appears to be responsible for your observation. The change in color probably was a result of the twilight glow causing a reflection off the aircraft. The initial sighting of the aircraft as it 45 to 60 minutes after sunset, the twilight stripes become orange, yellow, and green in that order. This could account for the brilliant orange color.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE J. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
