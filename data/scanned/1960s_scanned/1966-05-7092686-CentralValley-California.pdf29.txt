Text from the document:

At a party last a date which three flew over quite low, flying formation. These were very highly brighter than any star I've ever seen. Each was a single white light. 

The reason I was so long in contacting you was because I didn't have any authority.

I am in the Air Force here and I think they are something in our ships that doesn't belong there.

Our duty is to gain and maintain morale in supremacy through a constructive public relations. I believe that great simply because we seem to ignorant to accept what we don't understand.

I thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
