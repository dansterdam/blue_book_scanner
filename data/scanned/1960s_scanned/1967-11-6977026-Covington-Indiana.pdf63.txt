The image appears to be a grainy, black-and-white photograph of a landscape. The central focus seems to be an object or structure in the distance, surrounded by dense foliage or vegetation. The image quality is poor, making it difficult to discern any fine details.

COVINGTON, INDIANA REPORT

On the evening of 6 November 1967, my wife and I observed a very bright orange light in the sky while on our way home from Danville, Indiana. The light appeared to be about 30-40 degrees above the horizon in the southwest direction. The light seemed to be hovering or slowly moving back and forth. After watching it for about 5 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and moved rapidly out of sight to the northwest. The entire sighting lasted approximately 10 minutes.

I am a licensed private pilot and am familiar with all conventional aircraft. This light did not resemble any known aircraft. It appeared to be self-luminous and was much brighter than any normal aircraft lights. The rapid acceleration when it left was also very unusual for any conventional aircraft.

I am reporting this sighting to BLUE BOOK as I believe it was an unidentified flying object.
