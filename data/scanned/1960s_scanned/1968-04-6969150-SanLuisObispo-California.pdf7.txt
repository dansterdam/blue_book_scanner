DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
CHANGE COURSE?
GIVE OFF BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLASH OR BLINK?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPLIT INTO PARTS?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

My young son spotted it and called us out to see. (I believe we were sleeping - he talks a lot about UFO's, and "sees" them in everything that moves across the sky.)

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
By disappearing over next line of house. 

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEING IN FRONT OF OR BEHIND SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
It seemed to stay ahead, and to the right, of a light trailing it, which we took to be a plane.
