Cont. UFO Report Per AFR 200-2
The witness appeared creditable. He did state affirmative that one discussion if he was a policeman, he was wearing a borrowed police jacket at the time as early morning. This could have been caused by lack of detail to be associated to.
Park police placed a vehicle at the observers spot and cruised the roads to observe marshing vehicles with various light conditions to try to duplicate light conditions, but could not.
However, photographs established all night on the beach the following night saw a light and photographed it. Film is being forwarded to headquarters with photos.
1. Physical Evidence:
A physical evidence is questionable. Two triangular marks, about 18-20 inches apart or approximately 7" long were observed, made by Penna State Police. There is no evidence to actually establish any solid thing happened, except as described by the witness. The items pointed slightly down, and pushed into the sand, and evidence found in the form of angular surface about "4 - 6" below surface of sand, and pushed up to depth as deep as pushed up ridge. Smaller mark, similar to but not distinctly with any marks. An exam in photo, close up, will reveal more detail.
Some damp spots in the sand near by, which did not become noticeable until later, do not appear to have relationship to marks in photo. These appear to be unrelated to any thing seen.
Full cast of eastern hole is included, and partial cast or west hole, along with sand from general area.
