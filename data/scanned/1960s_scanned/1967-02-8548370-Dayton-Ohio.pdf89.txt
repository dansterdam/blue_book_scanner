There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This seems to be a page from an old UFO report document that contains a form or questionnaire. The text on the page includes the following:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The rest of the page is blank, likely for the witness to provide additional details or information about their UFO sighting.
