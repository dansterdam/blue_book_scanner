On August 12, 1949, my wife and I, together with our two children, were driving north on Highway 41-A, approximately two miles north of Manchester, Tennessee. Suddenly, we noticed a bright light in the sky, hovering above the trees. She immediately brought our attention to this. We watched it for about 10 minutes, and it seemed to be rectangular in shape and giving off a bright glow. It then suddenly disappeared behind the trees. My neighbor (who also saw it) and I went to investigate, but could find nothing. They then reappeared again. We watched them for a few minutes, and they then disappeared again. This occurrence took place about 10 years ago, and we have never been able to satisfactorily explain what we saw that night.
