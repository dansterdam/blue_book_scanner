The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from the Air Technical Intelligence Center in Dayton, Ohio, dated July 15, 1963, addressed to "Gentlemen" and describing a person's experience of taking test exposures during the solar eclipse on July 20th. The letter mentions that the person developed the film and is enclosing 5 x 7 photographs, and provides contact information for any further information that may be wanted.

Gentlemen:

On July 15 of this year I was taking test exposures for the eclipse that will occur on July 20. I was using a 3 inch telescope with a 1 1/4 inch finder. I attached a 35mm camera to the finder without the lens. I developed the film at normal time. After drying I printed the pictures, now I am very curious what figure No. 1 is. please figure and as quickly as possible what code I enclose five 5 x 7 photographs. If more information is wanted call [redacted].

Very truly yours,
[redacted]
