Analysis and Conclusions: A sighting occurred in the vicinity of Dubuque, Iowa a few days prior to this incident, and it received quite a lot of publicity. All this publicity could have prompted this report. For this particular case, although it was reported that some characteristics of the object were similar to those seen in Dubuque, the overall duration of the sighting which was considerably shorter, would seem to indicate that this was probably a misidentification of some conventional aircraft.
