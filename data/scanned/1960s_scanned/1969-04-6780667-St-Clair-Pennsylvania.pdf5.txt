Dear Sir:

Your letter has been referred to me regarding the incident that occurred on April 17, 1960. There were no photographs or other physical evidence obtained in this case. I wish I could give you more definite and complete information, but the facts, as we have them, are rather limited. The incident appeared to have been a genuine sighting, but it is difficult to determine exactly what the object was that was observed. I will be glad to discuss this matter further with you if you have any additional questions.

Sincerely yours,
