Air Force UFO form continued
MUCH LOWER IN ALTITUDE THAN A VERY FAST OBJECT WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED BEFORE. I SEEMED TO BE UP AND DOWN LIKE A DIVING OBJECT. IT WAS A VERY FAST OBJECT AND I COULD NOT ACTUALLY DETERMINE HOW BIG IT WAS - ONLY THAT IT SEEMED VERY SMALL, LIKE AN AIRPLANE IN THE DISTANCE. THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW CLOSE IT ACTUALLY WAS. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 20 MILES AWAY OR JUST A FEW HUNDRED YARDS. I THINK A RADAR MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE ITS DISTANCE AND SPEED BUT OUR EQUIPMENT IS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE.
SOME TIME ago I DID SEE AN OBJECT THAT SEEMED TO BE MUCH SLOWER AND WAS A VERY BRIGHT GREEN. IT CAME DOWN VERY CLOSE AND THEN ZOOMED UP STRAIGHT INTO THE CLOUDS. IT SEEMED TO BE A SOLID OBJECT AND I COULD ALMOST MAKE OUT A DEFINITE SHAPE, BUT I COULDN'T DESCRIBE IT IN DETAIL.
JUST A SHORT REPORT ON THIS LATEST SIGHTING. I REALLY COULDN'T SAY WHAT IT WAS, BUT IT SURE MOVED WITH TERRIFIC SPEED.
