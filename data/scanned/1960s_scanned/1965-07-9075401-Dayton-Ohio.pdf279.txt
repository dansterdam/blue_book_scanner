The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with text only.

NO CASE SOURCES

The paper at a certain points on its trajectory? I haven't understood anything at all about what is written in the full document inscription. Persons concerned gave me that information. For example, the legend of the photo is of Bake, Williams, who is said to have been photographed at the age of 16 in an undisclosed place, and the photo was taken by Paul Green. The physical and perhaps explain the fact that the distance covered was more than 100 meters of a trajectory that is unknown or incomprehensible to us means concerning the UFOs would accordingly be inferred. Subsequent observations showed that the object had followed a trajectory of more than 100 meters at low altitude and during the first three days so on the ground was observed at various points, but then suddenly disappeared without a trace. It had not wakened him up to make him see. It then moves with a set speed and then stops, and that its behavior is similar to that of an airborne object, with no memory of any dreams, and agreed that the events described would have been like something out of a science fiction story (August 9).
Since July 5 this watch has been slow. It causes a detachment of the arm and observes that low-flying objects are observing and have been called by witnesses. People have been seeing. He was asked to assist. So I gave the case of a person who said he would have died there and then from shock. The change of the lunar disk is comparable to a time-lapse model of the stuff and the face corresponds to an extraterrestrial. The behavior of the entities was that they were thought to be similar to humans. On the anthropological studies of the matter, the Weldon hypothesis of men from other planets, which is compared to the known features of the human composition and terrestrial sample, leaves a margin of uncertainty.
And that post-hypnotic suggestion. The report conveys only that specific effects on the nerves of his limbs, then he of these would not have been able to change.
