ADDITIONAL DETAILS OF OFFENSE; PROGRESS OF INVESTIGATION, ETC.:
2-27-67 Subject was Robert W. Colhead, 319 Boede Sq., Fargo And he was an Air Force Sgt. at Fargo Minn. AFB. He stated that he saw a large circular object floating about 30 feet above the ground in the sky and it had six blinking lights around the bottom of it. The object was about 70-80 feet in diameter and he watched it for about 8-10 minutes. He said he got a good look at it and it was not a plane, helicopter or anything he had ever seen before. The object then took off at a very high rate of speed and within 2-3 seconds it disappeared from sight. He did not see any occupants or anything coming from or going into the object. Publicity on pending this investigation. Also publicity may send sight-seers in which could hamper the investigation. I will interview the subject again tomorrow and get more details.

2/27/67 Contacted Major Seiney and he will have an Investigator here tomorrow to see the subject. R. Anderson.
