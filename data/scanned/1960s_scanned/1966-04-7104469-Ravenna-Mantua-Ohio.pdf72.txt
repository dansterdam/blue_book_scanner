AIR FORCE SAYS IT WAS PLANET VENUS
Explanation Of UFO
The Air Force's explanation of the sighting of an unidentified flying object April 17 in Portage County, Ohio, is that it was not a flying saucer, but a satellite passing the planet Venus.

The Portage County sheriff's deputy who reported seeing the object, according to a report issued over the weekend, the Air Force said:
"The probable cause of the sighting by Sheriff Dale J. Spaur and his deputy was the passage of a satellite, as it approached the southern portion of the sky, it disappeared, and Sheriff Spaur got out of his car and saw the planet Venus."
"Venus was rising in the southeast and was brighter than any star in the sky. It is the planet Venus."

SPAUR was quoted as saying that on investigation they made they couldn't find much of any evidence to indicate it was something more than the planet Venus. He said he had two brief phone conversations with NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) official Major Hector Quintanilla, head of Project Blue Book, the Air Force official UFO investigations project. They lined up two and a half minutes, he said.
"It of all, don't think there is a satellite that saw it or that they took a satellite to be large or fast enough for it to zoom or go or maneuver anyway."
"I'm definitely sure it was the planet Venus racing wildly over the countryside."
