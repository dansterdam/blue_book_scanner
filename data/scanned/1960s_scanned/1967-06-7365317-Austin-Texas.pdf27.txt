Lt. Foreman collected all such data for you. Again, in abbreviated form, I have studied extensively in various areas connected with rocket research, ballistics, computers, systems analysis, 1951 and 1952 I did extensive research work with various recording devices, etc and worked with numerous capable multi-state researchers. I have several multi-state technical papers on the performance of specific multi-stage rockets and subsequently was employed in bioenergetics. The Texas Junior Academy of Science also allowed me to lecture in the physical sciences. Also, I've studied a bit in astronomy and meteorology, and related areas. I have seen the Goodyear blimp many times, both at night and in daylight (having lived in Phoenix).
