FIJI
Double explosion

On Wednesday, correspondent A. M. Robb of the Sydney Daily Mirror in Australia reports that at 8:30 p.m. on July 6, 1964, he saw two strange phenomena in the sky over Fiji.

He describes seeing two bright bluish-white lights or explosions in the sky, separated by a double interval of several seconds. The phenomena appeared to be travelling beam-like, which in the correspondent's opinion was that of a travelling beam, as well as from a distance along the horizon.

After these three or four seconds there was a second double explosion, similar to the first. The correspondent states that it was a definite double explosion and that the interval between the two explosions in each case was about two or three seconds.

A report from Sydney says that unidentified flying objects were seen over New South Wales on Thursday, at various locations, but no further details are given.
