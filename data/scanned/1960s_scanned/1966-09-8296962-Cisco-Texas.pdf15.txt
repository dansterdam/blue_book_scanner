The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch shows a compass rose and a graphical representation of the movement of an unidentified object in the sky.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "0" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that shows the path, or "track", of the object as it moved, starting from the "A" and ending at the "B", and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
