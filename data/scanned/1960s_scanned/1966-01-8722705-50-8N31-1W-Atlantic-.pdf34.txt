There is no photograph present in this document, which appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report. The document contains text only, which I will transcribe below:

Dear Sir:

Reference your letter of 29 March 1966 regarding a photograph of an unidentified object. Photo analysis has been completed and we are returning your original prints as soon as possible.

The following conclusions were made by the Photo Analysis Section:
1. No image on the negative/print appears to be from an object of any kind on the water or between the water and the camera.
2. In fact, the image does not appear to be that of any defined object. The image seems to be a result of lens/water condensation on the film, or an internal reflection inside the lens.
3. A water droplet on the lens, water condensation or an internal lens aperture reflection appear to be the most reasonable explanation of the image.
