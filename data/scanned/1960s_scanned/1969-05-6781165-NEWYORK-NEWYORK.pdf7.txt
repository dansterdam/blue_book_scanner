The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

Here is the text contained in the document:

"WHAT TOOK PLACE TO THE PHENOMENON
Suddenly sped up and stood off and back
Moved up in the sky and retreated
Suddenly fled up and out east
Flew out of sight
WHAT IS YOUR EXPLANATION:
I have no explanation for the phenomenon I observed. It was a strange sighting that I cannot account for. The object moved in a manner that I have never seen before, and I am at a loss to explain what I saw.
