Dear Sir:Enclosed is a letter explaining my reason for the report to you regarding the incident of Wednesday morning, Oct. 4th, at 2:30 A.M. I had watched on the horizon and noticed what seemed to be a most unusual object in the sky, which was unlike planes or blimps. The object was brilliantly lit and appeared to be of the "saucer" shape, emanating from the outline of the "saucer" shape. It maneuvered over the ocean. It appeared to live in the Carmel area. This seems about a half mile high. The brilliantly white vapor trail was visible from the newspaper and police station, and some observer had telephoned in, with the same description given this morning. Apparently it had never before observed anything of this sort, and also shocked by what it seemed to be. His name is known to me. And we would like to acquire the information if this additional activities are available regarding same. Thanking you in advance, yours truly... [Redacted]
