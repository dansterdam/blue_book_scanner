THE SECRETARY
CHARLOTTE, N.C. 
JULY 20, 1956

Dear Sir:

I might as well let the world know about this... I cannot think of a thing to do about it but tell you. I have never seen anything like this before and I can't even imagine what it is. Only this other man who was with me saw it. It was one of the most unearthly things I have ever seen. It isn't like anything I've encountered before, and the boys around here think I'm seeing things. But I know I did see it, and the other man who was with me saw it too. He said he never saw anything like it before, and he is experienced in observing mechanical things. We both noticed it at the same time. 

This is about the size of an average bath tub and it has a dull gray color. It seems to be made of some sort of metal. It hangs about 100 feet in the air and is perfectly motionless. It appears to be slightly elliptical in shape. It neither goes up, down, nor sideways. It just hangs there, in the air, and doesn't seem to be supported by anything. I'm not able to explain it, but it's there. The other man and I watched it for about ten minutes until it suddenly became obscured from our view by some trees. We waited around for awhile to see if it would reappear, but it didn't. 

I would appreciate it if you could give me some idea of what this thing is... Where it came from, what it is, and where it went. I am very much puzzled by this incident and I would be glad to furnish you with any other information that might be of help in clearing this up. Can you tell me anything about it?

Sincerely yours,
[SIGNATURE]
