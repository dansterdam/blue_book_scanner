DEAR SIR:
Your telegram was received today and was quite a shock to us.  I can assure you that The enclosure was just a joke on my brother's birthday and was not meant seriously.  I can see how you would be disturbed and worried over the contents.  We had no such thing in mind, nor do we have any plans to try anything of that nature.  I am sincerely sorry for the confusion and trouble this has caused you and your office.  Please accept my apologies and I hope there will be no further misunderstanding.
Sincerely yours,
