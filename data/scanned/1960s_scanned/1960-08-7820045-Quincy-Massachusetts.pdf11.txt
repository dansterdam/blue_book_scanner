The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

The text in the document reads:

"The object then began to increase in size as if approaching. It maintained its original shape throughout the observation. The movement was very slow, as if increasing in distance as time went by. The object remained in view for about 10 seconds and then appeared to diminish in size as if retiring in the distance. The color remained a steady glow, whitish in nature. The object showed no structural details as it increased in size and decreased again. Its movement was smooth and uniform, without any jerky or erratic motion. The object then disappeared from view, blending into the night sky.

I think there is an excellent possibility that I obtained a glimpse of an actual unidentified flying object, rather than any conventional aircraft. If it is the object with which I am familiar, it is of a remarkable nature and constitutes an important contribution to the field of UFO research.

I will not have the film developed, so that if you wish to see it, you will have to send for it, and enclose it in your envelope it yourself. It you need any other information, please let me know."
