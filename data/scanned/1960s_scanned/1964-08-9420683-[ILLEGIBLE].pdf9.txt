Dear [REDACTED] and [REDACTED],

1964. This is in reply to your letter of August 14, 1964. The report submitted concerning your observations of unidentified flying objects.

We are interested in finding out from you both just how these sightings have differed from normal aerial activities which you previously observed. If you have any additional observations on this matter, and are willing to furnish them, we will be pleased to receive them. Any envelope for your convenience.

Sincerely,
