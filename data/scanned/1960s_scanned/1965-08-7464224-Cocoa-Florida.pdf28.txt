S: In this same report received from the CO tonight, I seem to have a feeling that some of the statements colored lights observed by four policemen were reflections from the ground.

Let us suppose that we were looking at a street light at a considerable distance. How would the light you saw differ from the street lights?

S: Well, Mere Street lights I believe now on a clear night you could see that the street light was round, that it was of a fixed intensity. This was not round. It was like a free burning light, like a match light, not a manufactured light, but a regular burning. And the intensity part (?) I think that's what gave the impression of different colored lights.

H: In other words, it gave you the impression that the light was coming from it.

S: That's right. Un huh.

H: Up to this time we have all had the impression that those lights were points like stars.
