Not all Soviet scientists completely agree with the listed requirements. F. A. Tsitsln (of the State Astronomical Institute), for example, does not agree that only single stars are capable of having planets which fulfill the other outlined requirements. Tsitsin goes on to point out three instances where a binary star system could have an inhabited planet. In the first of these the two stars are very close together and the planet rotates around their common center of gravity. In the second instance the two stars are far apart and one or both have a planet rotating around them in the favorable temperature zone. In the last case a planet is considered to be in the libration point of the binary star.

Although it's not agreed that each factor listed must be met for intelligent life to develop, as evidenced by the preceding discussion. The list does serve to indicate some of the considerations necessary in trying to accurately determine the probability that intelligent life exists elsewhere.
