Gentlemen:
My name is [redacted] and I would like to submit the following UFO report.
On August 22, 1966, at approximately 7:30 p.m. EST my friend [redacted] and I were observing the sun more closely (we are both amateur astronomers). Taking a brief rest, we decided to take a stroll. As we glanced into the sky, we noticed what appeared to be two ordinary airplanes. At the time, the sun was setting so features on the ground were obscured. My friend noticed that the object had two flashing red lights, one at each tip. It appeared to be hovering and did not move. As the object approached zenith, I noticed it seemed to be slightly smaller than the green light of the sun. The object appeared motionless. At zenith the red and green lights went out, leaving a dull, yellow light that was apparently glowing in altitude. As the object approached zenith, the features were no longer distinguishable. It returned and finally disappeared in the west. Period of visibility was one minute, fifteen seconds.
Would you please give me your opinion of the sighting?
Yours truly,
[Redacted]
