There does not appear to be any photograph present in the image. The image shows a handwritten document, which appears to be a page from an old UFO report document.

As requested, here is the text output from the document:

On Dec 2, 1966 I was driving home from work in Indianapolis. I saw something very bright in the sky. It was about 30Â° or more above the horizon in an easterly direction, traveling in a northeasterly direction at a speed that would be about 2 or 3 times the speed of an aircraft flying at 30,000 feet.

It was in view for 10 minutes just being a bright object at first about 1/3 of a degree in diameter. From time to time it seemed to get slightly brighter and a little fainter, around at 30-50 mph in a pulsating fashion. Something like the way a light bulb would come on and off.

Just before it went out of view over the horizon, I could see that it was oval in shape and resembled a pie plate in size. There seemed to be no wings or protrusions and no lights of any kind. At a great speed.

I did not report this sighting to the authorities. I guess they would have thought I was trying to pull something on them. I regret that I did not.
