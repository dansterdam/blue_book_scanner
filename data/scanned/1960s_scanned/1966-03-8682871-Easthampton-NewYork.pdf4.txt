Paragraph K. Comments of Preparing Officer have been confusing and vague. The majority of reports have been & saying - Probable cause of sighting unknown unless influenced by publicity received by UFO recently. Paragraph 16 of AFR 200-2 says: The preparing officer will make a preliminary analysis and a comment on the possible cause or identity of the object he is reporting, together with a statement supporting his comment and analysis. He will make every effort to obtain pertinent items of information and to test all possible leads, clues, and hypotheses concerning the identity or explanation of the sighting. The preparing officer receives the report, initiates a search to identify it, and passes on his conclusion.
