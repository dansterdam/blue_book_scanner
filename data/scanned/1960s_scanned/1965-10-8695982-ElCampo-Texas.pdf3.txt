Dear Air Technical Intelligence Center,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

I am a resident of El Campo, Texas, and I along with other persons have observed unidentified flying objects over this area. On two occasions I have noticed these flying objects approximately 7-8 miles south of El Campo traveling at a very high rate of speed in a northerly direction. The objects are round or spherical in shape, and emit a bright white light which is sometimes followed by a reddish or orange trail. On one occasion in 1955, I observed a similar object at a much closer range. It was traveling at a rapid rate of speed and disappeared behind some trees. These objects have been observed by other residents of this area at various times. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with any information regarding these sightings or investigation of this phenomenon. Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
