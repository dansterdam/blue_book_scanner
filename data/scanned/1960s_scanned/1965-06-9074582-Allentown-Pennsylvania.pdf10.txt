The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten report or document. The text in the document describes an observation of a strange object in the sky, describing its appearance and movement. The document appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

"Starting this seemed a strange air this passing plane in a second the object far over into a field dun. The object blacked a gleden sun, about the size of a nickel held at arm's round, like an orange, but more rounded, of a lighter color, and hovering, still over the same spot, just moves up and down slightly, with nothing seen outside the object."
