LYNN, MASSACHUSETTS UFO SIGHTING - AUGUST 29, 1964

BACKGROUND:
On Saturday, August 29th, upon the return home from a business trip, the witness noticed a strange object in the sky. She called her husband to come outside and observe the object as well. They observed the object for some time until it eventually disappeared from view. The witness then called a friend of theirs who had also witnessed the object earlier that evening. The friend confirmed that he had seen the same strange object.

The document then goes on to describe the details of the witness's account, including the size, shape, and movements of the observed UFO. It mentions that the witness attempted to call the telephone company to identify the object, but this effort was unsuccessful.

The text does not appear to contain any sketch or photograph of the observed UFO.
