Text from the document:

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. MOVE IT BACK AND FORTH UNTIL THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD. PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
