The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was the US Air Force's systematic study of unidentified flying objects.

Transcription of the text from the document:

"January 4, 19XX

1 - Estimated elevation - X?
2 - Estimated speed - X?
3 - Estimated size - X?
4 - Estimated direction - XXX
5 - Missile?

Each object appeared to have a blinking light, varying in intensity and color was dim in nature. Objects appeared to be in formation and executed maneuvers or changes in speed and direction. Objects disappeared quickly from view.

My observation may have been only a small part of a larger unknown incident, but felt should be reported as requested per Project Blue Book requirements."
