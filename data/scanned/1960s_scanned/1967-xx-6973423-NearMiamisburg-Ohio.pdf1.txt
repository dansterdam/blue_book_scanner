PROJECT 10073 RECORD
2. LOCATION Near Miamishurg, Ohio (3 witnesses)
12. CONCLUSION Possible (AIRCRAFT) since the object observed apparently NE of the observers it was probably over battering. Both the observers stated that the object disappeared to the northeast. So one possible explanation for this case could be that it was an aircraft.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS There is nothing to indicate that this object could not have been an aircraft. It could not have been anything else based on the information given.
Observers sighted an object that periodically maneuvered back and forth from a position apparently to the northeast of the observers. The object was going back and forth for several minutes. Its size was approx that of a medium-sized aircraft on a clear night.
