There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing handwritten text.

Text from the document:

6. And the way of descent I was at an appraising on the right of the right-hand side.

2. Flier long was each object in sight?
Half hour.

10. Did the objects drop on 7 January have the same characteristics as those seen on 13 January?
I don't know.

12. Give a detailed account of each object's movement. Steadily-slow movement from the Southeast and back to Southeast where first seen. Also very fast movement.

12. What was the ceiling height on 13 January?
I don't remember. I think it was a clear night.
