14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
I was driving, and seen the object in the sky. When the object moved away, I continued to observe it until it finally disappeared.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It seemed to just disappear all of a sudden out of sight. I went to the house to make the telephone call. When I came back, I could not see the object.

B. IF THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
The object seemed just about above a few trees on my land, as it moved away.
