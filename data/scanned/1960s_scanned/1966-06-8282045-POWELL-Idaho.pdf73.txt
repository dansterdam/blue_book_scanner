The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed report with analyses of multiple moon images. The report number is 55-11, dated 16 November 1966, and it discusses the findings from frames #5, #7, #8, and #9, which indicate multiple moon images, as well as frame #10, which appears to have been taken with the camera swung to two different light traces, and frames #11 and #12, which discuss the appearance and location of the spacecraft. The report concludes that the furnished materials and photographs do not represent imagery of spacecraft and that they were deliberately created by the photographer. The report is approved by Charles Chaffin, Photographic Technician, and William L. Turner, Chief, Photo Analysis Branch.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO.: 55-11, DATED 16 NOVEMBER 1966
Frames #5, #7, #8 and #9 - Once again, multiple moon images indicate that several exposures were used.
Frame #10 - In frame number 10, it appears as though the camera was swung to two different light traces.
Frame #11 - Two, possibly three, exposures were utilized to make this photography, as indicated by the slight back-ground displacement.
Frame #12 - The spacecraft is in an ideal location and approximately the correct intensity for an internal camera lens reflection. The spacecraft is probably a secondary image, since the flight traces would not normally extend directly as a bright light.
Frame #13 - This is probably a single exposure since the moon image is smeared rather than distinct as in several of the other frames. Once again the spacecraft is probably a secondary image in the correct position for a specular highlight.
It is the considered opinion of this office that the furnished materials and photographs do not represent imagery of spacecraft and that they were deliberately created by the photographer.
