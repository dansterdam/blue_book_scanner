UFO Negatives

Windsor, Ontario, CANADA

1. This replies to your letter of September 29, 1967, in which you enclosed two negatives of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

2. Although the Aerial Phenomena Office does not investigate sightings of unidentified flying objects, United States Air Force Regulations do provide for the collection of photographic data and the analysis of photographs of such objects. Since we would complete the enclosed AF Form 117 and photographic data sheet and return them in the self-addressed envelope we would appreciate it.

3. Because of an error made while having prints made, we are unable to identify which negatives are yours. Included are prints which may or may not be from the negatives you sent. You may keep these prints if you wish.

4. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
