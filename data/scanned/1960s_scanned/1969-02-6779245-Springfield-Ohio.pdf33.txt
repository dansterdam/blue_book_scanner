At attached for your files is the NICAP MASS SUBCOM Monthly Report for January 1969.

The "Witness Profile Report" for each month will now be a physical part of the Monthly Sighting Report and will be found on page 13. Pages 1-6 and overlays will comprise the 1969 Annual Overview Report at the end of the year.

NICAP MASS UFO Report #69-6 has been sent to NICAP. #69-4 is still in process. Other than these two reports, there were no others in the unknown category. As practiced in the past, only those reports considered "unknown" still be submitted to NICAP. However, copies of these in the "known" category are kept on file at NICAP MASS and copies may be obtained upon request.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler
Chairman
