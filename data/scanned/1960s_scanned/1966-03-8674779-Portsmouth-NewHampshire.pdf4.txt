The image does not contain a photograph, only a hand-drawn sketch. The sketch appears to be a response to Question 19, which asks the witness to "Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects." The sketch depicts an ovoid or elliptical shape with some irregular lines and an arrow pointing to the right, presumably indicating the direction of movement.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Is moved behind: Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
In front of: Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound as a whispering sound
b. Color approaching 1/3

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About 1/3

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing the object that you saw such as wings, protuberances, etc., and especially exhaust trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was/moving.
