Scanning and producing the text from the document:

Bearing 5-2 degrees azimuth. There was a surface radiation inversion during this period from the ground to 300 feet, and a very strong inversion between 3,000 and 12,000 feet. This inversion was strong enough to cause radar reflection between 9,000 and 15,900 feet and could have caused a distortion of Arctares.

The unidentified object was tracked on radar from time of the sighting. They had no records of VHF traffic - Houston radar records indicated no UFO or unusual sightings during the period in question.

The fact that the object disappeared by shooting up 90 degrees into the air mass was unidentified since such an abrupt change in position events an astronomical explanation.
