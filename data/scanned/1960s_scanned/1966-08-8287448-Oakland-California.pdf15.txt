The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an illustration and diagrams. The illustration shows the path of an object or objects that the observer saw, and the diagram shows a compass for orientation.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you see the object as shown above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show the direction of the object (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Only one object was observed - it was a fast, bright object.
