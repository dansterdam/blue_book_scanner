The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a diagram and instructions for describing the sighting of a UFO. There is no photograph present in this particular page, only a diagram showing the angular positions of a sighted object relative to the observer's position and a compass.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place on "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

THERE WAS JUST ONE OBJECT.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

THERE WAS JUST ONE OBJECT.
