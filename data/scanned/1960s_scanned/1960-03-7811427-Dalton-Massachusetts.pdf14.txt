The shared image appears to be a scanned document from the Wright Air Development Center, titled "EVALUATION REPORT". It does not contain any photographs, but rather text describing the analysis of an ice water sample. As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

EVALUATION REPORT
ANALYSIS OF ICE WATER

REPORT NO: 4708 P50-7
PROJECT NO: 577101
MANUFACTURER: ATON-4322
SUBMITTED BY: James G. Colton

I. PURPOSE
To analyze a sample of thawed ice water and determine its composition.

II. ACTUAL DATA
1. The sample was received and assigned Physics Laboratory Suborder No. 
2. The sample was analyzed by emission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis.
3. Emission spectroscopic analysis indicated the water to have the following composition:

Filtered thawed ice water -
Major - Magnesium
Traces - Silicates, aluminum, iron, nickel, copper, sodium, zinc, chromium and calcium
Large and small particles (residue) -
Principal - Calcium
Major - Silicates, magnesium, aluminum and iron
Minors - Manganese, copper, sodium, zinc, titanium and chromium
Traces - Tin, lead and nickel
