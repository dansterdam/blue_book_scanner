these 90 ii clear to say,
i wanted to believe you denying people from
Thr y - one at the might have been
on a sightod i was a regular
this seemes to the whole problem know as only
possible to explain it and may well be of all
this report - a flying and a day time
the object moved at a rapid rate of speed
and i know it didn't i come over it in what may
have have been a private plane but i am sure
i saw it clear every time at first it seemed
to be a low flying plane but as it got closer

known type of air craft i suppose it may have
been some sort of very high flying and advanced
air craft but i doubt it and i thinkk i would
know a plane from any type of air craft as i
have seen many in my day and night flying.
