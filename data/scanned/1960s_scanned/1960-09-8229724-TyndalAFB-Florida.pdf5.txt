STATEMENT

On or about 12:25 p.m., 8 Sep  1960 I happened to look up at the sky and noticed a grey object in the southwest. I called to my wife to have a look at it. The object appeared circular, silver in color, and hovering. It seemed to be at an altitude of approximately 1500 to 2000 feet. After watching it for some 2-3 minutes, it began to move in a southwesterly direction and was lost from sight in about 1 minute.

I had a watch on but did not record the exact time. The object was in view for approximately 2-3 minutes. Shortly after seeing it, I called the authorities to report it but was informed that it was probably a weather balloon. I stated I did not believe this was the case as the size, color and movement of the object did not conform to that of a weather balloon. I reported this incident and was advised to have no further concern about it.
