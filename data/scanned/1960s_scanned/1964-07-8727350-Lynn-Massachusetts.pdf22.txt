This same object had previously many sightings by many observers, and details of shape and size which this report adds to. The object was first sighted at about 2130 hours, and it was visible for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared. It was at a very high altitude, and was watched by the witness, against the sky, as it moved steadily to the east. The witness reported that the object appeared to show no lights and was in the form of a dark or silhouetted form against the sky. The object appeared to be elongated and cigar-shaped, and was estimated to be at least several hundred feet in length, though its exact size was difficult to determine. The witness stated that the object's motion was smooth and steady, and that it appeared to be under intelligent control. No sound was heard by the witness. The witness reported that this was the fourth occasion on which he had sighted similar objects in the sky over the past several months, though on previous occasions the objects had been more distant and not as clearly observed as this one. The witness stated that he was confident that the object was not an aircraft, satellite, or any known type of aerial vehicle. He felt that the object was definitely "something unconventional or unidentified."
