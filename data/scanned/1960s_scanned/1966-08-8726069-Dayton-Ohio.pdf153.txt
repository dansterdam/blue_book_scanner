The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which includes a sketch or diagram and some text-based questions related to UFO sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass to show the direction from which the object came.

28. Draw a picture or sketch of the object or objects that were seen. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and place a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The sketch shows a compass with various degrees marked around it, and there is a hand-drawn "x/10" at the bottom of the page.
