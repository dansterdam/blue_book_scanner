Vandenberg Sighting Report

2045 - FPS-16 locked on two strong targets, one moving around and one stationary. One of them a 50 db target. Target seen in the general direction of the visual sighting, but the optical position was not determined with sufficient accuracy that it could be stated unambiguously that it was a simultaneous optical-visual sighting. Original interpretation was a helicopter, with another one assisting.

2100 - Checked for possible air traffic in the Vandenberg area with the following activities: Point Mugu - no; Operations ceased. Com Fleet Air, Alameda - no aircraft in the area; 15th Air Force at March AFB - countermeasure flights in the area? No. NORAD - no. FAA Center, Los Angeles - no.

2100 - Point Mugu fired up FPS-16 and reported that they saw strong targets headed toward Vandenberg AFB (VAFS). The targets must be behind one another in a line, because of the narrow beam of the radar. Lock-on, automatic track mode.

2100 - TPQ-18 at Vandenberg saw many targets. One at 8 nautical miles' range, 4,000 ft. altitude, 290Â° azimuth, proceeded south at slow speed. At one time the TPQ-18 saw 4 targets but usually 2. Point Mugu saw as many as 8.

VAFS and Point Mugu did not correlate their targets - that is, they did not establish that they were looking at the same targets. The TPQ-18 began to get different targets. At one time a strong target approached and went right overhead.
