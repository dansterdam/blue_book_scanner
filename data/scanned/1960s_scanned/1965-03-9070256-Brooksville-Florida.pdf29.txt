The image does not contain any photograph. It is a page from an old UFO report document with typed text.

phone numbers were given to MacDill so that they could arrange the survey, if desired by PTD.
Since it was near 1600 hours on a Friday afternoon, and knowing the communications difficulties that might arise, it was decided that MacDill PTD. would contact Dr. Debus and give him the details. Mr. Alexander, AFWO, Maj Quintanilla had not heard from MacDill and was not aware of any action. Lt Alexander had not been called by anyone at MacDill. Lt Alexander had not located Capt Kirwer and Maj Quintanilla was not contacted.
It is directive of MacDill in Brooksville at 1600 hours Saturday, 6 March 65. Lt Alexander called Dr. Bemis. Dr. Bemis was out and was not expected back until late afternoon. Finally we provided Dr. Bemis typing and administrative support in publishing his report.
