The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

This samples any pictures from the area to Dr. Brown. It is Colonel Bouchard's understanding, "as far as I know", Dr. Brown did not visit the actual site, some 30 miles southwest of Maguire. I can make available to try knowledge, did not include a chemical analysis to determine nitrate content or anything else by Dr. Brown or by anyone at Maguire.

Colonel Bouchard said the samples would be sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for complete examination by Air Force experts. Said Colonel Bouchard, "He only conducted the initial investigation." We are sending the samples to Wright-Patterson where he will be kept.

Since Dr. Brown did not take any samples of his own for examination, and since he left his statement with the Air Force at Maguire at the time of his visit, it would like to know how Dr. Brown determined the presence of potassium nitrate and what his views are concerning the "bruised marks" on broken trees. A copy of this report will be sent to Dr. Brown.

In drawing Figure 1, it was noted that triad holes A and B are almost the same distance from the center of the crater and are almost centered on the crater. However, the third hole C is not concentric.

Assuming the position of hole C could be changed to form a more concentric triangle, C would have to lie on a declining axis with a diminished distance from the center. This would satisfy the triangle indicated between the three holes would fall across the broken branch, and come very close to showing the point of the break. This leaves, possible to a very definitive conclusion.
