Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
Gentlemen: 
On the night of September 8, 1966 at approximately 8:00 p.m. my son, wife and I were returning to our home in Tulsa, Oklahoma from a visit to my wife's aunt who lives just west of the city. As we approached the city limits, I noticed a very bright light in the sky traveling in a northeasterly direction at a very high rate of speed. I immediately called it to the attention of my wife and son and all three of us observed the light for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before it disappeared from our view. 
The light appeared to be about the size of a basketball and was extremely bright, much brighter than any star or planet that we have ever seen. As it traveled, it would occasionally flash or blink on and off. The light did not appear to be attached to or connected with any type of aircraft, at least none that we could see. At the time of the observation, the sky was clear and the weather was calm with no wind.
This is the first time that any of us have ever seen anything like this and we were all quite amazed at what we observed. I would appreciate any information that you might be able to provide regarding this occurrence.
Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
