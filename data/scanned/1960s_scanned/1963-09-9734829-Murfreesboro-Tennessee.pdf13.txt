Kent visitor
The flying object, which is shaped like a flying saucer, was sighted by Mr. Joe T. Blackwell, of 1019 Jones Blvd, Murfreesboro, Tennessee, on September 10, 1963. Mr. Blackwell reported that the object was hovering over a wooded area at about 500 feet altitude, and had been observed for about 20 minutes. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter, and was silvery in color. It had no visible means of propulsion, and made no sound. After hovering for several minutes, it moved off rapidly over the trees and disappeared from sight.
Mr. Blackwell is president of the R.A.F. at Smyrna, has a good reputation, and is considered a reliable observer. This report is considered genuine by the investigator. The object was not detected on radar.
