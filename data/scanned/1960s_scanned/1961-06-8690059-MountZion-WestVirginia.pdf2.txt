The text in the document is as follows:

APCN-39/Major Friend 
Unidentified Flying Objects
Mr. 
West Virginia
June 23, 1961

Reference your letter of 13 June 1961 to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center concerning certain sightings reported from your home in November 1957 and June 1961.

These sightings of unidentified aerial objects you forwarded with your original letter have been carefully identified and designated CONFIDENTIAL by the United States Air Force. Copies are being returned.

These objects were dropped in the United States by the Air Force for the purposes of training pilots and radar crews and for testing the equipment of the Chain Reaction Satellite.

Chain Reaction is designed to interface with radars of different specifications. These objects are usually released from the aircraft in bundles which open to allow the individual piece of chain to fall alone. On occasion, however, individual pieces of chain will fall alone.

This material is designed to fall extremely slow, and therefore any impression of extreme speed in its descent is not realistic. Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

FRED J. EVANS
Deputy for Science
and Instrumentation
