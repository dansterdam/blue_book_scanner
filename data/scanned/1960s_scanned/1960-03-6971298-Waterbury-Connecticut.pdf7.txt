U.S. Defense Dept.
Washington, D.C.
March 15, 1960

Dear Sirs:

On March 11, 1960 at approximately 6:15 P.M., I observed what we think was a flying saucer. I called my father, and my sister to have a look at it. It was traveling at a high altitude and was circular in shape, and very brightly lighted. It was traveling at a very low speed. As we observed it, a peculiar kind of glow seemed to encircle it. We then told the members of our class about it, and found out that other children had observed the same thing with their parents on the same evening, so I decided the best thing to do was to tell you about it.

Sincerely yours,
