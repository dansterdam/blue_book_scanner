The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The page contains a questionnaire form, with question 34 asking "Date you completed this questionnaire:" and the response filled in as "26 Feb 1964".

Text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 26 Feb 1964
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
