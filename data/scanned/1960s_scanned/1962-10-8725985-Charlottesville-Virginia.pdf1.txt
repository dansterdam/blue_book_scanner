11. COMMENTS: Satellite ECHO 1 over Virginia at 10:42 pm. This places ECHO in possible exact location to be observed by witness. Satellites they often appear to move at constant rate, seemingly for certain duration, and disappear. This is attributed to atmospheric conditions & witness's own optical capabilities when object approaches and when it disappears.
