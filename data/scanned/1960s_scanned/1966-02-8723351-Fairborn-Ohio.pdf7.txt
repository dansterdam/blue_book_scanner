The image contains a photograph or illustration depicting a compass with instructions on how to use it to determine the position of an observed object. There is also handwritten text describing the observation of three jet airplanes at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet.

Transcription of the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in the course by drawing an arrow. NORTH
