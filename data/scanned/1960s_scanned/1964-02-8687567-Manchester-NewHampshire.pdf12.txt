Dear Major Jacks:

Enclosed please find detailed UFO Report and Photograph. 
I have enclosed a copy of my personal resume to provide background on myself as investigator. I have corresponded with ATIC in the past, vis: a report concerning a low-hovering UFO sighting by my wife in June 1961; a report on a sighting in South Weymouth, Mass. in June 1963; and, I've sent various newspaper clippings on UFOs to ATIC.

I have followed UFO Reports seriously since 1947 and hold membership in NICAP, APRO, and a local UFO Study Group etc. to provide myself with up-to-date information - hence my interest in making personal investigations whenever possible. I trust that this report will be of some value to you, if only a statistic. If I can be of any further help to you concerning any local UFO sighting in my area, I will be glad to cooperate.

Yours Sincerely,
