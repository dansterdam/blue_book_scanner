Based on the image, there is no photograph present on this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains only text and illustrations.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" the object you first saw, then on "B" the location of the object when you first saw it. Place on "C" the direction the object was traveling when you first saw it. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
