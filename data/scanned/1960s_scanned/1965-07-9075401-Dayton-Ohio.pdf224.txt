"NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY) 1 JULY 1965 Valensole, Fr.

AI44 (1 GO) 

VALENSOLE, FRANCE, JULY 3 (AP)--GENDARMES IN THIS MOUNTAIN VILLAGE SAID TODAY THEY ARE INVESTIGATING A REPORT BY A FARMER WHO SAID HE SAW A MYSTERIOUS LAND CRAFT TAKE OFF FROM HIS FIELD. 

DOZENS OF PEOPLE CAME TO SEE TRACKS LEFT BEHIND BY THE "FLANK ROUND WITH FOUR METAL LEGS." MAURICE MASSE, 41, TOLD THE GENDARMES HE SPOTTED THE CRAFT THURSDAY MORNING AT DAWN. HE SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A BIG MUSHROOM BALL AND HAD FOUR METAL LEGS. WITH THE CRAFT, HE REPORTED HE SAW A SMALL HUMAN FORM, ABOUT THE SIZE OF AN 8-YEAR-OLD CHILD. 

"SUDDENLY," MASSE SAID, "THE CRAFT TOOK OFF AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE SKY. I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES."

MASSE SAID HE WENT TO THE SPOT AND FOUND TRACKS LEFT AND GROUND THAT WAS SCORCHED HARD AS CONCRETE.

A GENDARMERIE OFFICER SAID STRANGE TRACKS HAD BEEN SEEN THAT MORNING IN A FIELD THAT THE GLOWING CRAFT WAS HARD-PACKED. MASSE, WHO HAS A REPUTATION FOR BEING CALM AND SOLID CITIZEN, WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE LAVENDER PLANT IN HIS FIELD BEING TRAMPLED BY THE CROWDS, WHO CONTINUED TO ARRIVE TODAY.

"WE DON'T THINK IT WAS A GAG," ONE GENDARNE SAID."
