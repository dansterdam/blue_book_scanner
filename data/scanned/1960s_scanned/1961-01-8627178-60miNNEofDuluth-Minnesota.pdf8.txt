Dear Major Coleman:

I appreciate very much your sending me a list of your sightings in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan.

You will note from the enclosed mimeographed report that I did consider this work as one of these sightings.

I shall perhaps take the liberty of bothering you again a year or so from now for any additional material reports that may have come your way.

Would it be a lot of trouble for you to give me the name and address of the individual with whom I should get further information on this one if possible.

Very sincerely yours,
