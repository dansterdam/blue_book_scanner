A strange place called (1952) sighting. I was in my backyard looking upward for something or the other when I noticed a large silvery object hovering over the tree tops. It was round in shape and about 45 feet in diameter. It appeared to hover motionless for several minutes then suddenly it started moving at a high rate of speed straight up and disappeared from view. I have no explanation for what I saw. I am a trained observer and I know this was no conventional aircraft. I reported this sighting to the UFO officers at nearby Travis Air Force Base but they could offer no explanation. Apparently there was no other report of this sighting. I am submitting this report to hopefully aid in understanding the UFO phenomenon.
