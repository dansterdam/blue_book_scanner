Text from the document:

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

Reference your letter regarding your December 7 observation allegedly of a bright object in the Denver, Colorado area. A light or lights were observed in the sky. The description, size, brightness, movements, and other characteristics are similar to many other reports of that type which are frequently received. This type of phenomenon is visible in the heavens.

When stars are viewed low on the horizon the observer is looking through many more miles of the earth's atmosphere than when looked at overhead. This distortion by the atmosphere can cause various colors or the illusion of pulsation. This phenomenon is called "scintillation". The closer the object, the more they scintillate because we are looking through more atmosphere. Planets twinkle far less than stars.

From the information submitted, it does appear that the sighting you observed was an astronomical phenomenon and not an unidentified flying object. The Air Force received several reports during November and early December of this type of sighting, as expected.

Thank you for reporting your sighting to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
GEORGE G. FREEMAN, JR.
