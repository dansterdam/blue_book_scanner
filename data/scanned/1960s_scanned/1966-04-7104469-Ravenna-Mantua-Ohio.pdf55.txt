Leads Sheriff On Fast Chase
Continued From First Page
from near Ravenna to Conneaut, Ohio.
Spaur said he clocked it at speeds up to 105 miles an hour from the ground. "It paced my car." Spaur said it looked like the head of a flashlight. "It seemed to be twice as wide and it just went on and on."
Two deputies on the chase said the object's lights were very distinct, "something like a thousand-watt light bulb." They said the object appeared to be oblong in shape.
Deputy Spaur said the object outdistanced his patrol car, which was capable of speeds over 105 miles an hour. "We' gave up in a mess of bridges. But when I came out from under the bridges it was gone and we waited around, but it never came back," he said.
Spaur said he believes it, but "It's true," he said.
Spaur said the only sound coming from the object was a faint, steady humming, "like a transformer." He said the object appeared to be going up and down hills.
All police radio communications and traffic control centers in Ohio and Pittsburgh said they had tracked fast-moving, unidentified objects on their radar.
