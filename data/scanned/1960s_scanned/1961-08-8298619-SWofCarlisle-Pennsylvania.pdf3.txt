Carlisle, Pennsylvania
August 10, 1961

Chief Inspector 
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Our company possesses a guest house on a mountain top Southwest of Carlisle. A group of us were holding a meeting, August 8. It was warm and we were sitting on an uncovered veranda.

As we looked to the Northwest, we observed a bright light moving rapidly, but in a swerving course Northwest lattitudinally. It moved in an east and then a northwestern direction and disappeared behind the trees.

The night was clear, stars were plainly visible. The North star provided a sense of direction.

As we followed the course of the light, it seemed to move a bit erratically from side to side and on a few occasions seemed to jump ahead. Though all of us observed these various movements, I recognize they could be attributed to impaired visual conditions or eye concentrations.

I have been at a loss as to whether to report this and, if so, to whom. I would hate to appear you that the light observed was not an airplane. With the sky as full of "exotic objects", one hesitates to report any observation today.

Sincerely yours,
