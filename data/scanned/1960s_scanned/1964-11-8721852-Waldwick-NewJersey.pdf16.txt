Mystery Object Over Argentina

Astronomers at the San Miguel Observatory near Buenos Aires, Argentina, reported seeing a strange, elongated, flattened and reddish-colored object which appeared to speed across the southern sky at 34 times the speed of a jet plane on the night of November 7th.

The object, elongated, flattened and reddish-colored, traveled from west to east in 2 minutes and 10 seconds (8:40) and from west to east in 3 minutes later (8:43). The astronomers who observed the mysterious object said it crossed the meridian-zenith, travelling in four directions in succession. It did not resemble any known type of aircraft, and that even taking into account different orbital heights, the difference in speed was phenomenal.

The above information also stated that the preceding Thursday (November 5) a man near Paraná, in the northern Province of Entre Ríos, reported to police that he had seen a fast-moving light, object showing flashing blue and white flashes sweeping over several times on their vehicle.
