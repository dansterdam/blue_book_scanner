CASE REPORT 65-9070256
On 20 March 1965 the Brooksville, Florida, Police Department was notified of a mysterious flaming object in the sky over Brooksville. Several citizens had observed the object, and officers were dispatched to investigate.
Upon arrival, the officers observed a round, glowing object in the sky emitting a reddish-orange flame. The object was seen to move erratically at a high rate of speed, disappearing and reappearing in the sky over a period of several minutes.
The object was observed by a number of citizens and police officers over a 15-minute period. When the object finally disappeared, there was no evidence of its having fallen to the ground. The citizens and officers were unable to determine the nature or origin of the object.
No physical evidence was recovered, and no conclusion could be drawn as to the identity of the object. The case was classified as "Unidentified" and filed.
