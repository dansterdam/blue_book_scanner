The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains a diagram and several instructions for the observer.

The diagram on the left shows an angular sketch with various angles and compass directions. This appears to be an illustration for the observer to estimate the elevation and direction of a UFO sighting.

The text on the page provides instructions for the observer. It asks them to imagine they are at the point shown in the sketch and to describe how high the object was above the horizon and its position relative to the compass. It also instructs the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects and any changes in direction during the course of the sighting.

Additionally, the text asks if there was more than one object, and if so, to draw a picture showing how they were arranged and the direction they were traveling.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Straight path

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
