NEW LONDON, MINNESOTA

NEAR-LANDING IN MINNESOTA: A nine-year-old boy, named Gary G__, was near New London, Minnesota on 26th. He says that he usually does nothing unusual around the place, but on this particular day, something very unusual happened to him. It then raised a "stick" of some sort, resembling an antenna, and seemed to be sending out information of some kind. It then returned the "stick" as though it had received the information it wanted. The boy kept observing the object from a distance of about 50 yards, but could see nothing. It then rose slowly into the air and when it had reached a height of about 15 feet, it darted rapidly away. The whole incident lasted about 10 seconds.
