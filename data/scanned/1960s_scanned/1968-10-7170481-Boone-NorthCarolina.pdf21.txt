NICAP MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE
BOX 15 BRAINTREE. MASS 02184

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT: 19 October 1968, W. Quincy, Mass/1:30-2:30 AM ET
DATE: 22 November 1968
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman 
TO: NICAP, Washington, D.C.

BACKGROUND:
Several days after the sighting, I received a letter informing me about the incident. I assigned investigator Eric Thornes to conduct an interview with the witness. 

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS:
Although the sighted phenomena has some of the characteristics of a searchlight, the duration, maneuvers and the associated "blue and amber lights" seem to rule this out. The bright actinic ascent of the object above the sky was Sirius but it was only a few degrees above the horizon and I cannot explain this phenomenon. A round body was visible which would not blink out upon the approach of a conventional aircraft. 
This investigatio9n was made by the "Special Sightings" team of NICAP and the report is submitted "as is". However, no stress or inferences are made unless they have been critically evaluated.
