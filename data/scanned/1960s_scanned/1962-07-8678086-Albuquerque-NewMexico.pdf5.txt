was a smal 1 and one-half to trge saucer-shaped object about 20 to 25 feet in diameter with a dome and side lights that hovered over the witness' home for about twenty minutes before speeding away. The witness reported the incident to the Atomic Energy Commission and several Air Force officials including a Major stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The witness, a woman, was a chemist and considered herself a reliable observer. She stated she was afraid to be quoted directly as she was fearful of ridicule. This report is the only one of its kind from this witness.
