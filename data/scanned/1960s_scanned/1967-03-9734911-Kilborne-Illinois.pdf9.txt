Kilbourne's U.F.O. ??
By Ted Connolly
The incident described occurred in a rural area near Kilbourne, Illinois on March 9, 1967. I was approached that evening and asked if I had seen anything unusual in the sky. I had at first passed this incident off as nothing but peculiar, but having learned more about it since, I now feel that it is deserving of investigation.
It was approximately 8:00 p.m. and I was walking along the driveway to my home. The sky was clear and dark and I was looking up at the stars. Suddenly, the sky seemed to be changed from a bright blue-white color to a dark, reddish hue. This change occurred in a matter of a few seconds. I hurried into the house to get my camera, as I felt that some unusual phenomenon was occurring. When I returned outside, the sky had returned to its normal appearance. I took several photographs of the area, but they showed nothing unusual.
That evening, a neighbor, Mr. James McCord, came over and told me that he and his wife had observed a strange object in the sky at about the same time I had noticed the change in color. They described it as a disc-shaped, metallic object which hovered above the trees for several minutes. It was a bright red-orange color and appeared to change color slightly as it moved. They said that when they first saw it, it was directly overhead, but it then moved slowly to the east and finally disappeared from sight.
This photo was magnified approximately 200 times the size it was viewed.
