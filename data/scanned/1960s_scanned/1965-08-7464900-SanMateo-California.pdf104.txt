The image contains a sketch or diagram that appears to be part of a UFO or unidentified flying object report document from Project Blue Book. The sketch includes a curved horizon line with angle markings, as well as a compass-like diagram with a central symbol. There appears to be no photograph present in this particular image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

80* 75* 70* 65* 60* 55* 50* 45* 40* 35* 30* 25* 20* 15* 10* 5* 0*

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
