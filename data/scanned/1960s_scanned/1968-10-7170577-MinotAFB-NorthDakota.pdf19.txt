MEMO FOR THE RECORD

9 November 1954

Subj: Telephone conversation of 31 Oct 54, Col Werlich - Lt Marsan

Col Werlich had the people fill out the AF Forms 117, of course. He said I mentioned them while they filled them out, but I can't see where a navigator can help. What I did was take a blotter to get the angles and show them what GO,30 etc angles were.

The descriptions of this will take care of these sightings also. The courses were quite varied over a couple of hours and the objects took many courses. It will be interesting to cross check it with the RAPCON versus the ground observers. Most of the original sightings were of the aircraft.

The one we (Lt Marsan) are mainly interested in the one that cannot be identified. The one of radar and the aircraft correlated pretty well. But the other said Lt Marsan should get a session map of the area. Base ops at Wright-Patterson has hundreds of the statistical maps of the Minot area.

Look on map, half way down the runway, TACAN, 30Â° radius, 16 nautical miles. This is where aircraft saw the object. There's farm fields there. There is nothing there that would produce this, type of lights. The came for October 7 which is near Greno. I have gone over that are with a chopper. This weekend I would like to go down with a camera sooner and to about up the OSCAR 7 break-in. I (Col Werlich)
