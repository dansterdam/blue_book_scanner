The image contains a hand-drawn sketch depicting two objects in the sky. The objects are described as oval in shape, circulating and extremely bright, with intense light trailing after them, and a visible "vapor" or apparent trail. The witness has provided a rough sketch of the observed objects and has asked if there is a natural explanation for this observation, stating they have not reported it to any newspaper and would prefer to have their name unpublicized.

"a. Notes on Objects: Oval in shape, circulating. Object extremely bright, less intense light area trailing after object. Color blue-green to yellow-green. Object appeared to change color slightly as it circled. Apparent trail (vapor?) or otherwise after it had passed.
b. Rough sketch of objects: OBJECT # 777???77?

I would like to know if there is a natural explanation for this observation. I have not reported this to any newspaper and would prefer to have my name unpublicized.
Thank you.
