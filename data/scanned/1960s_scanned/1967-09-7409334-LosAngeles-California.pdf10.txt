MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Reference Physical Specimen 26 September 1967
7 December 1967
Captain Margenthaler called and asked to have the following questions answered.
1. Could the sample be part of a rocket body or space vehicle?
2. Is there any indication of burning or charring on the outside?
3. Could the object be a meteorite?
8 December 1967
Called Mr. Huston (Head of Materials Lab)
His response to the questions were:
1. Sample (large) was not part of rocket body or space vehicle. It has much too high a silicon content. The slag has a high silicon content such as found in the sample.
2. The sample had been molten at one time. This again was expected of the slag.
3. It is also unlikely that the object is a meteorite, since it does not contain enough Ni.
11 December 1967
Called Lt. Marley (Metallurgist)
1. Lt. Marley did not think it was a meteorite either because meteorites are usually high in Fe, Mn, and contain some Ni.
