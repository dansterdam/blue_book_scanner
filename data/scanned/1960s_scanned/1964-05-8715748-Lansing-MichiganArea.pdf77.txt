Michigans or Grates Road) were awakened by a humming noise appearing to come from a source, both were in the house at the time, got dressed, and went out to the driveway where they noticed the source of the noise on the ground approximately ten feet from the house.

And say they observed an object approximately a 10-degree elevation angle, perhaps as low as 3 degrees. By several experimented approaches, the object size appeared size of the full moon on clear nights, but seemed substantially closer and smaller than the moon, which is not in view or easily be seen in the sky at the time of the observation, which was shortly after 4:00 a.m. on the morning of the 8th.

And say they did not see the object on this side (cannot were sound) but they heard the noise to inside, this house nearly dimmed according to the investigator was a slowly pulsating the hole of a detail, what the investigator later understood meant the noise made by the force of a pulsed electric current when one is following close a pulsed magnetic field.

When the sound of a pulsed object which and the investigators generally in the top-secret data, which was never perfectly, was of a loud background of noise which this already quite experienced. The noise was described as very loud.

The object appeared to be suspended rather than just hovering and seemed to be glowing with a hazy glow, perhaps a little fore more intense than that from the bedroom window, and said that the object apparently passed by at about that distance. He estimated the speed at perhaps thirty feet per second, rather close to the ground, going across the fence to the woods. One on each side of the window, but not directly in front of it. The time of the incident would be approximately 1-2 seconds. Immediately after the object had moved, the noise was gone, and it was quiet again.
