The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page consists of questions and responses, with the respondent providing detailed descriptions of their observations.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
[The response indicates that the motion was "more careful, here".]

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
[The response indicates that the object appeared "very large, at the height of its closest approach".]

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
[The response indicates "Covered it."]

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
[The response is "Zit."]

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
[The response provides a detailed description of the object's appearance, noting that it appeared to be "very strange light in the best explanation" and that "that is all times it appeared to become larger and smaller, as if getting close and then far away, moving in and rotating, and there were what looked like windows at random bits of its surface becoming dark and light again".]
