Bionics
Next Year
It announcements - both for realignment and the shifting of men in
Major Commands will be awaited with keen interest by the technical and
security personnel at the Biomedical Laboratory,
The Air Force called the first symposium on Bionics last year. This
new science, drawing upon the latest knowledge in the life sciences and
electronics, is expected to make major contributions to the development
of new systems and devices dealing with matters of intelligence, control,
sensing, and physical strength. The symposium, held in October 1961,
brought together the nation's leading authorities on this new field.

MCOR Earn Cash Awards
Three employees assigned to the Aeronautical Systems Division have received cash awards totaling $450 from the MCOR program. They are:
1. Willard S. Wolfe and S. Lacey Sloper, $200 each, for their suggestion to provide an additional outlet to handle low-TV cameras. His suggestion resulted in considerable time savings and avoidance of equipment damage.
2. Billie M, McCall, $50, for her suggestion to provide a redesigned rewind mechanism for the APG-30 radar test set. Her idea saved time and money and resulted in easier handling of the test set.
