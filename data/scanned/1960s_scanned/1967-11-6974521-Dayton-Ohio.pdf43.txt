The light which seemed to vibrate and fluctuate in appearance, was a bright white light which seemed to remain at a distance and not to approach nearer to the observer. The source of this light was not determined, as no apparent surface or outline of an object could be discerned. The light seemed to be independent of any physical object and to be suspended in midair for a period.
