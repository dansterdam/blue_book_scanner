Re: UFO Encounter 
Dear Sirs:
It is my understanding that most reports about UFOs contain religious connotations, therefore your UBO case cannot be dismissed as mere superstition. I must confess that part - described - incident was largely publicity, and I cannot accept responsibility for any part of this to be published. 
I regret to say that I personally encountered nothing sensational or out of the ordinary. As you will understand, it is for the sake of others I do not wish to undergo rigid questioning or humiliation, and I will do everything in my power to travel person to be away from home for long or short period. Please let me know if that is convenient to you.
And don't forget I have only one set of the postmarks and will include the originals in my report to Dr. Hynek. I would be interested to know if your own copies compare with mine, as the existence of the sounds in them is vital to a careful investigation of me interference. I will keep you informed if there are any further investigations which may be called for.
There are no other facts which I did not include in my report. If you are really anxious to learn what I saw, I will be more than glad to answer them within reasonable limits, but I would ask you all for your patience in this matter. I await further word from you.

Sincerely yours, 
(Cir.) Morri
