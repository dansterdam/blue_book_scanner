1. Reference are UFO reports of 26 October 1967, 13 November 1967, and 20 November 1967 from 3500C-A. These reports were received in an envelope from 3500C on 4 December 1967.

2. Previous conversation between Lieutenants Steel and White of your organization, and 2nd Lt Marro, this office, regarding comments indicated that the original witnessed sighting was displaced and did not go any further. Subsequent conversation referring to a Highway Patrol investigation, your organization indicated that a detail of this report and comments it to our office. Our office has now received a copy of the original report as obtained on 25 October 1967.

3. There is nothing in any of the three reports to indicate that they have been investigated in accordance with AFR 80-17, and the reports themselves do not furnish sufficient data to permit complete analysis of this regulation. In particular, we would appreciate comments from the reporting officers as to what stimuli might have possibly caused the sightings. Also, in the comments section, it is helpful to our analysis if you would include those areas that you have checked, such as:

a. RADAR PERSONNEL - whether they had any pilots (identified or unidentified) at the time of the observation.

b. CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL - a statement as to whether the control tower operator observed anything unusual at the time of the observation. 

c. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES - often, they can provide information as to the reliability of the witness. Also, they may have required a UFO report, or additional information that may provide you with the stimulus of the UFO observation.
