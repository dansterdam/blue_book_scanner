The image does not contain any visible photograph or image. It appears to be a page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book report, with handwritten text.

Any marked variation in brightness: no
Did it explode, disintegrate, or suddenly vanish: no 
Any tail or trail: no
Did any sound accompany the object: I was on a screened porch and I heard no sound
If sound followed later, give time interval: no sound
Was it examined with binoculars or telescopes or photographed: no
Other remarks: The object was in the half way distance of a broken line in the sky. Part of a beam which was not like an arrow but it had been seen in the sky before. I should think it curved the park, being never too high while visible. It went behind a cloud and when the beam left it curved down to the horizon.
