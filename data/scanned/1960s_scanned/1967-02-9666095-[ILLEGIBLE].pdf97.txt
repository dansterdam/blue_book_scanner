AN ENCOUNTER

shiny silver gleam, but on cloudy days looks very dim. That third, they seem to be able to manipulate electricity as they please. I have found my house to be powerless when I know there is electric power on. I have found radios blaring that were off. My doorbell has rung at 2 a.m., with no one there. Farm lights and street lights have been on in great regularity seeming towards the zenith, and the rays of light but in black rays too. Three times knowns have used light to make pictures for me, cloudy night: once appeared a huge lighted area of a tall tree across the meadow. It was like a TV screen and in front of it was the figure of a tall man, but it vanished in space. The object on light but with three dimensions, and the first floating in front of the screen. That same object area was used as a "screen" while two small figures appeared to be bobbing up and down in front of it. The third was similar to this last picture and I wish I knew if I was entitled to an important thing that they can do anything they please with sound. 

If I knew anything about physics, I suppose they may not be separated from light and electricity, but because of distinct things that happened. For that a cricket near me in the grass did not move in rhythm as other crickets around the yard, and I realized it was a sort of dot-dash code. Tone of the horse coda when a young scout but never realized that they can do anything they please with sound.
