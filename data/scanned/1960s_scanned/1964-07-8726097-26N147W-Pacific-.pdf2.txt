31. Could you explain this questionaire?

32. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or by your previous explanation of your sighting.

The witness has provided a handwritten response describing their sighting. The text states:

"The object was quite large, about the size a C-5 airliner. It was hovering and moving slowly over the Pacific, 2 or 300 feet high. I watched it for some minutes. It then accelerated at an incredible speed and disappeared towards the horizon.

I am certain this was something very uncommon for my knowledge of aircraft. Please let me know the reasons of this. It could mean a tremendous event."
