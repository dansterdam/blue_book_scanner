Just what in the world went fishing the at Firem.n's Club, and as v^e on Tucker of J28 Young St were informed by someone called out firemen, thore was a group of girls who thought thoy saw a hot metal object like a bell or something land and then take off ag ain. It happened around 6:30
last night and they were like people who don't know exactly what to believe.
They were in West Middletown and had intended to go fishing on the bank of the river. One of the youths said, "What in the world is that?" and the others said, "I think it was an airplane that just came down from the sky."
"It was very bright and flashing," said Mrs. Tucker, who was attracted to the scene by the commotion.
"We were all fascinated and watched as it seemed to be like an airplane that was coming down slowly and when it landed, not on the stirrjfd, but across the river, there was a bluish green light around it, and it left an impression along the river it looked like a Christmas tree."
She said the object was huge and appeared to be completely lit up. There were flames going off and off, she said, as she watched.
"Someone said it smelled like a hot metal oil," she remarked, "and I couldn't see any, but it appeared to ba controlled. It wasn't some kind of helicopter or plane, the lights were different."
She said there was no activity as the strange craft and when we were up there was nothing to see. The others had seen it first from the bank of the river.
