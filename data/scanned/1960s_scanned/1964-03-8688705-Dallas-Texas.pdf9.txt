March 24, 1964

Dear [redacted],
This is in reply to your letters of March 9th and March 16th on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects.

Regarding the object you observed on March 1, the Project Blue Book file shows that the object was seen at about 40 degrees of elevation and 145 degrees azimuth from Randolph and Orion in the Southwest (as 220 deg.) at about 5:50 PM CST. The motion of the object was to the east. Consultation with an Air Force meteorologist indicates that the object was probably due to the high altitude condensation and trails of missiles being fired from White Sands, New Mexico, as is common for that area. I am satisfied that the characteristics of the object were similar to those signifying trails from those missile launchings.

As a satellite passes into the earth's shadow, it is no longer visible, which would account for the disappearance of the object. The Air Force does not carry data on the path or these objects other than those I have mentioned.

Both of these satellites are usually of the first and second magnitudes. They will continue to be periodically observed as 1962 B THETA.

Enclosed is the new Air Force Fact Sheet on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects which should be of help to you in writing your report.

Sincerely,
MASTON M. JACKS
