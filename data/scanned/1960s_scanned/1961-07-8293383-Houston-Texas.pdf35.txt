Text from the document:

A minute or two later, the 9 to 10 (eleven) came again. The object did not seem to notice the first approach and was again quietly hovering and swaying. This UFO, an a object about the size of a 55 gallon drum, was a fixed light, neither flashing nor changing in size. There were no wings or other features visible. The object was at an altitude of an estimated 500-700 feet. It stayed in this general area for about 10 minutes before moving off to the northeast, disappearing from sight. At the same time another UFO, much smaller, was sighted further north. The speed of the objects was very slow compared to jets or missiles, seemingly just hovering and drifting along. The weather was clear with a few scattered clouds at an altitude below the UFOs. Wind was very light from the south and there was no temperature inversion noted.
