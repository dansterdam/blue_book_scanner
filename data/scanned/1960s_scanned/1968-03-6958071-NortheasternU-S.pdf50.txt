Then--- HULLABALOO!! --- We all started talking at the same time! In the course of our expressionism, the conversation went something like this:

Someone: "It didn't make any sound!" (That wasn't a meteor, because a meteor doesn't have windows, but I'll be damned if I'll report it!) "I'm not going to report it either!" (Laughter) Someone: "Tremendous speed!" "What time is it?" (Looking at his watch) "Quarter to nine." "How high would you guess it was?" "Not more than 2,000 to 5,000 feet, or maybe lower. That thing was really low!" "What direction?" "Southwest to northeast." Whatever it was, it will be in the papers tomorrow." ------- As we excitedly compared notes, we agreed that we had seen some sort of our observations. This "agreement" seemed to comfort me, for I certainly didn't want to think that I had just experienced my first hallucination while I was wide awake - All three of us agreed that we had seen something other than any plane we had seen or had read about from our Earth. We thought that we had seen a "craft of some sort, except 2,000 or 3,000 feet from our Earth," or that we had seen a "craft from Outer Space." It was chilly outside and Mayor wasn't wearing a coat. Besides, our short discussion of the event seemed to suffice. It didn't seem strange that, so soon after, all three of us went back to our routine of daily living, for, after all, can anything really surprise us these days in this scientific era!

Most sincerely written,
