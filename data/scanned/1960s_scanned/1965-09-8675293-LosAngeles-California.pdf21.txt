MEMORANDUM 15 September 1965
SUBJECT: UFO, 2 September 1965
Sighting "or"

TIME AND PLACE: Approx 2345/98-2355 from Los Angeles, Calif.

REPORTED BY: North American Aviation, Inc., Space & Information Systems Divison, Resident Security Officer, Tel. 

Residence: Huntington Beach, Calif. 

Mr. and his wife were visiting friend  an electrician, who works for the North American Aviation Automatics Division, Cypress, Calif., at the time of the sighting. The witness was on the patio of the friend's house, looking for the object they had seen briefly earlier. The object was a bright object, very much larger than an airplane, but soon all looked. The object was about 50 feet long and 20 feet wide, disc shaped, with an orange-reddish glow on the bottom. All of a sudden they sighted the object coming up from the west at a rapid rate of speed. The object appeared to move rather slowly, then seemed to speed up and climb to the west. 

He personally observed the alleged UFO for about seven seconds, his wife said be looked about 10-12 seconds. Mr. has spent nearly four years in the U.S. Air Force and has had some experience with identifying lights and aircraft in the air. 

He said he had no way of telling how far away or at what altitude the object was. They watched the lights on the object very closely, but could not see any airplane flashing lights or warning lights. Based on this child's knowledge, he said this object was quite different from any aircraft he has ever seen. Mr. said he had never seen anything like this before.
