This page from the Project Blue Book report appears to contain a handwritten account of a UFO sighting, along with two sketches or drawings. The text is formatted in a table-like structure, with various questions or prompts and space for the witness to provide responses.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

STAND STILL AND SUDDENLY
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?

PLAY OR DART ABOUT?
DISAPPEAR NO REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
