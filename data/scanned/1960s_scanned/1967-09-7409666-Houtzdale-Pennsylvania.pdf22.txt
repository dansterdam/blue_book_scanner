Satellite Observations

Mr. [redacted]
Houtzdale, Pa. 16651

1. Since the objects are so small and we find any object as all on your slides
because they are so underexposed, we are returning them without any
photo-analysis having been performed on them. As we stated earlier,
we feel that the object you saw on 1 Sept at 3:25 A.M.
and 5:10 A.M. was echo JT220 effects. There are over 1,000 objects in orbit
around the earth at certain seasons. Not all of them have an easterly component
the more the higher the altitude. Not all the satellites have an easterly component
or in other words, travel from east to west. However, the majority
of the satellites travel approximately from west to east.

2. Not all these satellites travel at the same speed either.
For example, Echo 1 and Echo 2 are about 700 miles high and make
one revolution around the earth in about 2 hours. Pegaces A is
about 3,600 miles high and makes one revolution about every 3 hours.
The higher the satellite is, the longer the time for one rotation.

3. It is also known that the human eye does not continuously follow
an object as it moves across the sky, but rather jumps from spot
to spot, focusing at such spot. Because of this effect, satellites
may seem to cross the sky in a staggered fashion.

4. Your sighting of 3 Oct 1967 was very interesting. This is the
type of sighting we like to work on rather than small lights in the
sky. We have determined that this sighting was of a Reentry Glide
release from Wallops Island, Va. There were two cloud releases
from that point, one on the 3rd and the other on the 7th of Oct.
Occasionally, the type of rocket used can affect time of launch, and
the decline of release, we will send this additional info on to you.
