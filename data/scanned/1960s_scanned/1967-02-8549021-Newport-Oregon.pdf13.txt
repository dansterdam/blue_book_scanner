was much lower to earth than a satellite and more nearly estimated 5000 feet altitude. we are at 2000 feet above sea level and it would appear as the night bright white light from the east the size of a small star, gradually becoming brighter until it nearly disappeared. sighting duration approx. (1945 1957) usually a short duration except on one occasion of about 15 minutes. the light appeared to be straight away as the configuration of the path was nearly straight except for a slight swing off course demostrating a straight line illumination on a light source descending at an angle about 2 or 3 degrees left or right from the straight path. this report no made or found in this sighting. velocity of satellite in most unlikely and the brightness or glow of object quite distinct.
