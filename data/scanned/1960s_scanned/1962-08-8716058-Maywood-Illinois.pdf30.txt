NO CASO (INFORMATION ONLY)
6 AUGUST 1962
BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA

At 1:45 a.m. on the morning of August 6th, a truck driver named [REDACTED] was driving on a highway in the vicinity of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Suddenly his motor died and the headlights went out. As the truck slowed to a stop, the driver noticed a luminous object in the sky about 150 yards away. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was accompanied by another smaller luminous object. The larger object was estimated to be about 30 to 40 yards in diameter and was emitting an intense white light. 
The driver watched the objects silently for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before his motor and lights were restored. He then proceeded on his way, but the truck seemed to be under some influence as it did not respond normally to the controls for several minutes. The driver claims there was no sound from the objects and that they departed at a very high speed.
