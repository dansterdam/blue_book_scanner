The image contains a sketch showing the path and movement of an unidentified object or objects. The sketch includes a compass rose, curved lines, and labels indicating angles and positions. There is no photograph present in this image, only the schematic sketch.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same skyline to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place an "Y" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a dotted line to show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? (Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.)
