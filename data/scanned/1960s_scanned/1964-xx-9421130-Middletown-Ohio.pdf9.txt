18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and see how much of the object it hides. Tell us how many times the length of the match stick fills the apparent size of the object. This is a rough but valuable estimate of the object's angular size.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that seem to you important, such as the color, or whether there are any structures on the surface. If you saw motion, please make sure the drawing shows the direction the object was moving.
