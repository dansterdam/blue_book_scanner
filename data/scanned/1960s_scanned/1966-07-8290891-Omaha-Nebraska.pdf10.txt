An Force Sighting Command
Unti - Statistical Branch Base
Attn:
Gentlemen:

On Wednesday, July 13, at approximately 10:10 p.m. I saw the object in the south western sky. We started to observe it and we could distinguish a deep red-orange colored object. There were distinct fluctuations in the light intensity where the outer edges of the object became brighter and then dimmer, giving the illusion of a pulsation. As it moved, it's light fluctuation increased. It stayed in close proximity to the horizon. I observed it until approx. 10:40 p.m. when it gradually faded from view.

Sincerely yours,
