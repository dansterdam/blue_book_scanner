Dear Sir:

In reply to your request in the clearwater plan of july attempt to relate to you what I know on the night of july 2,brasilia marina which is approximately 2.25 miles from the city of the sighting of the sighted objets. On that we were advised that some jets were coming, I looked up and saw the thing (I was facing west) and now I saw that this object was brighter than the rest of the sky and was moving rather fast and irregularly, it appeared to me that the red objects were not observed from the ground since they seemed more closely they seemed to be moving the water, I follow my eyes until it faded from sight downstream. The lights were in the sky from where we were sitting on the yacht. I hope this information will be useful to you all of this tested only.
