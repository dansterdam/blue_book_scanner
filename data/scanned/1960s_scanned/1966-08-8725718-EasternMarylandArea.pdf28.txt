The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram depicting the motion and movement of an unidentified object or objects. The diagram includes a curved path, various angle measurements, and a compass rose. There is also a section asking the viewer to draw a picture showing the motion and direction changes of the object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved high the objects were above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object. Show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the ship.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
