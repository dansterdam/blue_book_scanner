UFO Report: Sighting of August 3, 1966 by Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED], Wilmette, Illinois.

Mrs. [REDACTED] (call sign "e") is a secretary at the School of Education, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. Mr. [REDACTED] is the Director of Communications, Illinois State Toll Road.

The Sighting: At about 0045, August 3, 1966, the [REDACTED] were preparing for bed after an evening of editing slides. Mrs. [REDACTED] looked out the bedroom window and noticed a bright object that appeared stationary. It was flickering, changing brightness erratically and showing faint flashes of red and green light. It seemed slightly elongated to the naked eye.

Mr. [REDACTED] called her husband's attention to it, and he agreed that it was not moving; he went to get his 7 x 50 binoculars. In the binoculars (which presented, apparently, some difficulty in focusing, since Mrs. [REDACTED] said something to the effect of "when he finally got the things focused..."), the object appeared as a green dome or flare above, a red dome or flare below, both flickering, and a horizontal row of lights between. Mrs. [REDACTED] had previously told the investigator that both of them had counted six, but the night of the interview Mr. [REDACTED] denied this and said the number had seemed to be "three or four".

The object was located forty degrees east of north, and fifteen degrees up from the horizon, by rough fist-measurement by the investigators; the landmark was the top of a nearby chimney which the object was very close to during the sighting. The witness fixed several degrees east of north.

During the hour of the sighting, the object moved "five or six degrees" toward the east. Finally, the Belmonts went to bed. At about 0445, Mrs. [REDACTED] saw the object again - see later.
