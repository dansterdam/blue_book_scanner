AP IN : 32822 (6 APR 66)  PG 4 OF 4

IN SPRINGFIELD AND THE DECATUR MUNICIPAL AIRPORT.
BECAUSE OF THE STRONG WIND AT THE 1200 FT LEVEL, THE
PAGE A QUESTION IS UNCLASSIFIED SINCE
SOUND EMITTED BY AN AIRCRAFT WOULD BE BLOWN AWAY FROM THE OBSERVER.
THE OVERCASE CONDITION IN THE AREA WOULD MAKE IT
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE SAFE OF THE OBJECT.
THE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT FROM THE OBSERVER IS
QUESTIONABLE. THE WITNESS IS APPARENTLY VERY RELIABLE SINCE HE
DOES HAVE EXCELLENT KNOWLEDGE OF HELICOPTERS, WEATHER BALLOONS,
AIRCRAFT IN GENERAL AND A FAIR BACKGROUND OF SCIENCE.
IT APPEARS THAT THE OBJECT WAS A LIGHT AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA. 
IT WOULD BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FACTATE THIS.
(1) NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE EXISTS.
(1) I FEEL FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS UNWARRANTED.
