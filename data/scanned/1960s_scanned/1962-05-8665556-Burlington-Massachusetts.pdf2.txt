The image contains a hand-drawn sketch showing the movement of an object in the sky, represented by a series of dotted lines. The sketch appears to be part of a report or document related to a UFO sighting.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Indicate the path or course that the object took. If the object was visible for some time, show the direction it took from the point where you first saw it until the last time you saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "R" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction along the line.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, then how many were there? Draw a picture to show the direction they were moving.

ONE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY FOR SOME TIME, AND THEN TOOK OFF AT A TREMENDOUS RATE OF SPEED TOWARDS THE SW. IT APPEARED TO BE VERY HIGH UP WHEN IT FIRST APPEARED, BUT SEEMED TO COME DOWN LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL IT FINALLY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW BEHIND SOME TREES. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROX. 3-5 MINUTES BY 4 WITNESSES.
