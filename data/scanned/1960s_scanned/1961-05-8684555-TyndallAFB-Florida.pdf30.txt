Talk 930

Request of Captain Clay L. Yeatt, AF Phillips 53rd FIS, Tyndall AFB, Florida. Copy on 930.

At approx 2300 hours on 25 May 1961, from the control tower at Tyndall AFB, the strange flying object was observed. Five officers from the tower reported that the object was first sighted hovering over the base, then it moved at a very high rate of speed, approximately 1000-1500 knots. The object was described as being round or circular in shape, and brightly luminous, somewhat like a mercury vapor lamp. It was observed for approximately five minutes.
