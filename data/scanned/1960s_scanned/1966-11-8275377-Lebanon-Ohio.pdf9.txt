CALL from Mr. 13 Nov 1956 revealed that two of his children were at approximately 0405 this morning, 13 Nov 56, when a fireplace screen fell. They looked out the window and noticed a red light going overhead. The light would get brighter, then dimmer, brighter, then dimmer, repeating the process until it seemed the horizon when a light like a star appeared. The star like object faded into the distance. A couple of minutes later another red, to dim, to brighter, object appeared going more West. His children said the object was visible for approximately 15 minutes. However, they did his children did not know how to estimate time and they could mean seconds or many minutes. His children came and woke him up after the objects disappeared. He got up but could see nothing. FTD forms 164 were forwarded to Mr. for his children's completion. Objects were going in a southerly direction.
