Three View UFO In Canada
Fishermen Alphonse Gaudet, Erle McInnis and Arnold Gazult sighted a large, cigar-shaped object which appeared to be about 100 feet long on 23 May 1964. The men were on 52 N Latitude, 164 14 E, about 75 miles off the shore of St. Lawrence Gulf, Nova Scotia, Canada. The object first appeared to descend slowly from the sky, hovered for a time, and then shot rapidly away at high speed.

Arnold Gaudet, through previous experience in aircraft hunting, initially thought it was an airplane until they noticed the unusual features. They said it had a metallic gray color and was revolving slowly. It disappeared after a short time, after remaining stationary for about 10 minutes. It was first sighted about 2130 hours. The object appeared to be about 20 feet in diameter.
