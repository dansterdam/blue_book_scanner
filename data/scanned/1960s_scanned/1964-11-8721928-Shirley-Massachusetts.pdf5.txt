2 December 1964

Dear Miss [redacted],

The object which you have described is similar to others which have been the subject of information furnished to this office. The duration of the sighting was committed as well as the observations. The data for the aid distance vicinity within which the object passed. Observations by the direction of flight or rate of motion were not associated.

A satellite observation from Massachusetts would hold as unsatisfactory components and duration would be slightly longer than that associated with satellites.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
