There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a response letter dated March 13, 1968.

The text in the document is as follows:

MAR 13 1968

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This will reply to your letter of March 3, 1968, in which you described an unidentified flying object (UFO) that you observed.  

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
