No Case Info Only
7 March 1967

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

Reference your recent letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object in the Port Arthur, Ontario area. 

An investigation will not be undertaken because the location is outside the continental limits of the United States. The information will be filed for future scientific studies.

The U.S. Air Force has received over 11,000 sightings of UFOs since 1947. Although there are some cases we have not been able to explain, we do not feel that enough evidence has been found to say that UFOs and extraterrestrial vehicles are the same. There is not any tangible evidence which can substantiate the belief that our planet has been or is being visited by extraterrestrial life.

It is more likely that UFOs represent some unexplained scientific phenomena.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
