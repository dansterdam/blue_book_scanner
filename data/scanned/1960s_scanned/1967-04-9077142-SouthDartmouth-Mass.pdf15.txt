35. Is there any additional information you can supply, including any special experience, which might be pertinent?

I believe I may have observed a satellite reentry object or small meteorite. It seemed to move rapidly across the sky, was bright reddish-orange in color, and left no trail. It was observed only for a few seconds. My first thought was that it was a flare or meteor, but it was more brilliant and did not seem to be dropping. I have always been interested in astronomy and have observed meteors and satellites many times. This seemed different from anything I have seen before.

My knowledge of astronomy is limited, and I am completely uncertain of exactly what I saw. I do hope that this information may be of some interest to you.

Sincerely yours,
