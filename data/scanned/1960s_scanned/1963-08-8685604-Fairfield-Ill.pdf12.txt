My sincere congratulations on the reply to my recent inquiry. Although through the eyes of experienced investigators, it is obvious that this incident is no threat to the security and well-being of the nation, nevertheless it is frustrating to me imperatively, but I believe some points are worth considering.
I should like to add that there is just too much similarity between us "Sincerely yours," and you to continue to throw for a "loop" to learn that there was no gold in the object, which was determined from a natural occurrence.
