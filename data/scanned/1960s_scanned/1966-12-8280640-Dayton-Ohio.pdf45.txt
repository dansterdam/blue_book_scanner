Dear Mr. 

This replies to your letter reporting the December unidentified flying object (UFO) sighted in Iran by you and your friend.

It appears difficult to investigate this report at this late date. In fact, it is now over a month old. We have standard procedures to investigate UFO sightings as soon as possible, but jurisdictional limits of the United States since we lack jurisdiction outside these limits. Your observation will be filed for information purposes.

Thank you for reporting your sighting to the Air Force; we appreciate your interest in our project. I have attached some reading material on this subject which I think you will enjoy.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
