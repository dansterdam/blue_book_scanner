The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass rose with various compass directions labeled. The second sketch depicts a landscape with a figure standing in the distance, with some handwritten notes around it.

PLACE A "T" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE CAR WAS TRAVELING. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON RELATIVE TO THE CAR AS IT DISAPPEARED.

In the sketch below, place an "X" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, a "T" to indicate the direction the car was traveling, and a "+" to indicate the position of the phenomenon relative to the car as it disappeared.
