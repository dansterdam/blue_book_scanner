The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document. The page contains a sketch showing the position of an object in the sky relative to the horizon and compass directions. There is also a compass rose diagram. The text on the page discusses instructions for drawing a picture to show the motion of the object or objects observed, and asks how many objects were seen.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

90°
75°
60°
45°
30°
15°
0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?

Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
