38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
I should judge that the object was not of this world, but rather an extra-terrestrial craft of some nature. This conclusion is based upon the unusual nature of its speed, performance, and capability of maneuvering which would be beyond the scope of any known aerial vehicle. It appeared to be intelligently controlled and guided. Possibly an exploratory craft from another planet or dimension.
