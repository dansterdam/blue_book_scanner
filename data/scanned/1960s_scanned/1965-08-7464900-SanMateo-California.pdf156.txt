LANDINGS IN PERU: Among dozens of important UFO observations in Peru this past summer, one of the most intriguing which have a fair amount of detail in the newspaper accounts that have been sent to us concerns a landing which occurred in a suburb of the capital city of Lima.

The witnesses were three Roman Roman Nunez saw a small device shaped like a barrel that hovered and landed in some brush. As he approached it, he was struck by a beam of light, and lost consciousness. When he recovered, the object had disappeared and he was very ill for a week. As he did so, he was enveloped in an intense red and light which came from the device. When his companion approached the object the following day, he experienced similar effects.

Thereafter, an examination of the scene revealed four circles, each about 9 feet in diameter, which presumably had been made by the landed object. These four circles corresponded to the position of four leg-like appendages which allowed the vessel to land at the bottom of a wood machine.
