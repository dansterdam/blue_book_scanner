(Description of the sighting which should give a concise explanation of your sighting.)
I could not make a satisfactory explanation of what I observed for about several minutes. The object that I saw hovered above some trees about (?) hundred yards away. It appeared to be oblong in shape and giving off a reddish-orange glow. It remained stationary for approximately (?) minutes and then slowly moved off to the Southeast. The object then appeared to move rapidly away and disappeared from sight in about (?) seconds. It was visible for a total of approximately (?) minutes.
(Request any necessary information to be provided)
That's strange behavior about this object I saw, maybe you could have some explanation for it. I would be interested to know more about what it might have been.
