Dear Sir,

I would like to ask you some questions about U.S.O.R.

If there really are U.S.O.R.'s, because some material shows they could be real, I don't know how much to believe the reports, unless there is geographical and other data to give them more credibility. Can you give me any information on U.S.O.R.'s or refer me to any sources?

August 11, 1967 a U.S.O. was reported W.C: 55 15 to 11:00. something crashed in the water and sank, but no samples recovered. Can you give me any information on this or other U.S.O. sightings?
