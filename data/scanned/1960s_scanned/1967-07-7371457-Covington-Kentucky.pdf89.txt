Proposed reply to letter from XXXXX, July 11, 1967 (Sighting#xx,xx7)

Dear Mr. XXXXX,

Reference your recent letter of July 11 in which you described the various unidentified flying objects which you have been observing since December 1966.  

At this late date, we would be unable to undertake a meaningful scientific investigation into your earlier observations.

If you would like us to investigate your latter sightings of July 4 and 7, 1967 we will need additional information. Upon completion of the enclosed PID Form 164, our analysis will undertake a detailed investigation into your observations.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified flying object, please contact the nearest military installation at the time of your observation. The UFO investigator at your nearest military installation is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

/s/ XXXXX
