The image contains a hand-drawn sketch showing the motion and position of an unidentified flying object. The sketch includes a compass-like diagram, and the text below the sketch states "THEY WERE NOT MOVING", indicating that the objects observed were stationary.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. OBJECTS HARDLY MOVED - THIS ONE MOTION MADE AS SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling. THEY WERE NOT MOVING
