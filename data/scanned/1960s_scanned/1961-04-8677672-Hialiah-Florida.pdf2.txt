Dear Sirs:

I would like to ask you some questions about flying saucers.

1. Are those oval-shaped things flying saucers?
2. If they are, what do you think of people piloting them?
3. Is it what do they look like?
4. The way I think it's flying saucer... 

On the day of October 28, [redacted], a flying saucer was sighted in his backyard. It was a hot day so we came out of the house to enjoy the weather. Suddenly, a bright object appeared in the sky. At first we thought it was a jet plane, but as it came closer we saw that it was not a plane, but a disc-shaped object. It hovered in the air for a few minutes and then suddenly disappeared. We were all amazed and frightened by what we saw.

I would greatly appreciate your reply to these questions, as I am very interested in learning more about flying saucers.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
