The image contains a few sketches and illustrations related to the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO). 

The main sketch depicts a compass-like diagram with various directional labels, meant to illustrate the positioning and movement of the observed phenomenon. Below this, there are two additional sketches - one showing a person standing in a landscape with mountains, and another showing a closer view of a flying object.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN THE TWO SIGHTINGS. THIS IS SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WITH TWO EXAMPLES OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
