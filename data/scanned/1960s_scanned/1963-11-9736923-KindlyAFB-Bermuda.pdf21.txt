SUBJECT: UFO INFORMATION ON UFO SIGHTING
According to information on a UFO sighting by Deputy Sheriff Robert Baker of Leflore County, Oklahoma, which took place on the night of 22 Nov 63, the witness observed an unidentified aerial object (UAO) over Longoria Air Force Base, Bermuda.
The object was described as round, aluminum in color, and appeared to be as large as a house. The object was observed for about 15 minutes making directional changes and varying in speed. However, various articles in the local newspapers have been discovered which describe the incident differently or have no recollection of the report.
Since there seems to be discrepancy and the form was returned to USAF on 13 Dec 63, we are consulting our consultants to the Air Force's project on UFOs, contacted by many researchers, in an effort to determine if the object in question has been observed on other occasions and if additional data is available that could corroborate or resolve the conflict.
We are anxious to complete our evaluation of this case, and request that copies of any newspaper items, however, as of this date we have not received copies of these newspaper items.
