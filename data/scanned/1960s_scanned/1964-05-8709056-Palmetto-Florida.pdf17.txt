The image does not contain any photographs, only a handwritten document. I will now proceed to transcribe the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
It the object just disappeared as a large dark bind around after dark.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No    Don't Know.  
IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: 

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No    Don't Know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of: This object traveled under very low clouds

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: 
b. Color: dark with fine lights colored spots

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
It would say not more than one fourth

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The object was a circular object with a larger circle on one side visible.
