Memo for the Record - 13 Feb 67

Contact with the Indianapolis Center in regards to observation of an alleged balloon over the Indianapolis area. The balloon came directly over the house at 15,000 feet and turned at the Indianapolis Center. The balloon could be seen from Applegate for 10 miles in the area was stumped by the balloon. He decided that the object was only about 2000 feet in altitude, but after 10 minutes it disappeared from view from Applegate. Another private citizen claimed that he got fairly close to the balloon. The contact at the Indianapolis Center said that the balloon did look like a military balloon, but many people would have mistaken the balloon for the "UFO".
