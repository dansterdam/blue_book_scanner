Bright Jupiter Seen in October
Jupiter and Saturn are still visible in October skies during the evening. The moon can be seen during the second half of the month, James Stokley reports.
The two bright planets Jupiter and Saturn are still visible in the October evening sky. Jupiter, rising earlier, can be seen in the southwest after sunset. It has a very bright brilliance, and ranks with the stars of the first magnitude. 
On the map, the two planets are shown on the course of the ecliptic, which depicts the apparent path of the sun through the sky during the year. The ecliptic is shown as a curved line, and the positions of Jupiter and Saturn on Oct. 1, 9:15 p.m. and Oct. 15, 8 p.m. on the 15th are marked. 
Jupiter will rank high among the brightest objects in the October sky. However, it will rank with the stars of the first magnitude. There will also be other bright star groups and constellations visible, such as Cygnus, the winged horse, with its bright star Deneb, and the beautiful Pleiades star cluster. 
On the map, just to the east of Jupiter, there is a first magnitude star named Fomalhaut in the constellation of Piscis Austrinus, the southern fish. Fomalhaut is the 15th brightest star in the sky, forming one of the stars in the well-known southern triangle. On the southern map, just to the east of Jupiter, we can see the constellation Aquila, the eagle, with its bright star Altair, and the constellation Cepheus, the king, with its star Alderamin.
