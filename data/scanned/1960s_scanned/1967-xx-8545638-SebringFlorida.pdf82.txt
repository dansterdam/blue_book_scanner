The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
   Day
   Month Year
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

As we were driving north on Washington STREET, I saw an object to the left of the sky, which at first appeared to be a plane. As we approached it, I saw it was not a plane and the less to be a plane and called the attention of the other occupants to it. We pulled over to the side of the road and the car stopped. The object was moving in the same direction we were at first, then stopped for about a minute. Then flew off in the direction from which it came. When the object flew off, the thing that seemed strange about it was that it made no noise, and it did not affect the street lights in the area.
