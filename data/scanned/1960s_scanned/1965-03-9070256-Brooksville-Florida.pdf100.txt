Dear Dr. Hynek:

The following summarizes our analyses, interpretations, and suggestions on the problem submitted to us recently by Major Quintanilla. This is the information that was reported previously but is included and supplemented here for the sake of completeness. We have divided our comments into several categories.

1. Composition of Fiber
The fibers are composed of plant fibers from the bark or the leaves of larger tropical plants. A variety of different species are included in this country and abroad. In some species are not distinguishable from one another in this condition. The most common examples are matsumata, gampi, bast or bastfibres, isiaj, or ramie.
Exhibit A includes photomicrographs showing botanical
identifications of fibers from the unknown sample and from two commercial papers (described below). It also includes photomicrographs of some of the fibers that appear to be coarser or known species for the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry.
