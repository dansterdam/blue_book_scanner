CASE NO. 8162 
NAHA, OKINAWA 6 OCTOBER 1962
DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:
At approximately 2030 hours on 6 October 1962, three military policemen, on routine patrol at Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to the west, at an approximate elevation of 15 degrees. It was estimated to be about 2 to 3 thousand feet in altitude and approximately 1 to 2 miles from their position. The light was observed for about 5 to 10 minutes, during which time it was seen to move across the sky in a generally northerly direction at a relatively slow speed. The light was described as very bright, nearly as bright as the full moon, and it appeared to be a single solid object with no strobe or pulsating effects. At no time was the object seen to increase or decrease in speed or altitude. The night was clear with unlimited visibility.
CONCLUSION:
This incident is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The object sighted did not conform to the normal characteristics of any known aerial vehicles or natural phenomena. The report is considered credible, since it was made by trained military observers under optimum viewing conditions. No further investigation was deemed necessary.
