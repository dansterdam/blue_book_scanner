There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from a document, which looks like it is part of Project Blue Book, a US Air Force study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document contains a checklist of various UFO-related phenomena, with checkboxes indicating whether the phenomenon was observed or not. At the bottom of the document, there are two questions asking for more details about how the observed phenomenon "finally disappeared" and what the witness saw in front of them.

The text in the document is as follows:

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE? YES
STAND STILL FOR A PERIOD? YES
MAKE ANY SOUND? YES
CHANGE SHAPE OR SIZE? YES
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR? YES
FLUTTERED OR BOBBLE? YES
WAS WITNESS ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON? YES

We were looking for that thing moving through the sky until it disappeared.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Went down a hill

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING?
