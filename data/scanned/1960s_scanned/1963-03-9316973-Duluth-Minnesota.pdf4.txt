No Case (Information Only)
Yeovil, England
2 March 1963

Match 15 minutes after they
were first sigheed, 3 light-like
objects were seen in the sky
over Yeovil, England. The observer, Mr. K., noticed the objects
while on his way to work, and
watched them for several minutes. He said they appeared
to be circular or spherical in
shape and were brilliant or
glowing white in color. The objects seemed to be at a high
altitude and moved erratically
at one point, seeming to accelerate and then slow down. According to the report, there was
no sound associated with the
sighting. The objects faded
from view after about 15 minutes. No photographs were taken.
