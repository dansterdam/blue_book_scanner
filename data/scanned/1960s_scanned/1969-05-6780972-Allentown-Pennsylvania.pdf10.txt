The letter describes seeing a "strange sighting" and includes a reference to a "Feinberg's parking lot" and a "tree". The writer mentions being interested in "UFOs, aerial phenomena, flying saucers, or whatever" and keeping an eye on the stars.

Here is the text from the letter, transcribed:

Allentown, Penna. 
May 6, 1969

Gentlemen,

Please do not think me a nut or a lunatic for writing this letter. I am 14 years old and my name is Michael. I have been interested in UFOs, aerial phenomena, flying saucers, or whatever you want to call it. On Sunday, May 4, 1969 my sister and I witnessed a strange sighting. We were going shadow-tag in Feinberg's Parking Lot (see diagram A). It was a clear night. Since I am partly interested in astronomy, I kept looking at the stars. While coming up from the light at the end of the lot I came to a tree. Once again I took a glance in the sky. Before I go on, I'll give you a background of what you should know.
