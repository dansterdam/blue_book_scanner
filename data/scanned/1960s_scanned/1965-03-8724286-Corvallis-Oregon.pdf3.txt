CORVALLIS, OREGON
4 MARCH 1955

Two observers, a driver and a passenger, in an automobile, were driving slowly on Toria Road, southeast of Corvallis, Oregon, when they sighted three lights, similar to roman candles, rising from the ground, several seconds apart. The lights appeared as yellow balls, about the size of a tennis ball and emitting a light. The flight path was almost straight up to an altitude of about 200 feet where it disappeared.

Observer stated that on the next day he went back to the area where the object was spotted and there was a dark spot on the ground. There were no other visible tracks or markings to the observer. The observer obtained a dirt sample from the darker areas in his field.

COMMENTS
Although the sighting is similar to a fireworks display, no evidence was uncovered that anyone was shooting flares or fireworks. Meteorological personnel and personnel of the Portland Air Defense Sector have revealed no correlation of this sighting with known air activity or natural phenomena. An analysis of the dirt indicated it contained a petroleum hydrocarbon base oil and no additional chemicals, such as nitrates or sulfur. Considering the information available, there is no explanation for the alleged sighting and the case is carried as unidentified.
