Transcription of the text in the document:

A straight line about 50° than disappeared, while may have and I were watching the object, it seemed to be nothing to appearanceIt was flying at a high rate of speed, about 50° or 60° from the horizon and began to make a zig-zag course going up and down in an irregular line of flight, the last and descent of which covered about 7 seconds. Enclosed is a picture of what may have been and I have it pretty well learned by heart. So may those of you who have not seen the object to be looked over as I am puzzled. Both the object and I were quite surprised at the disappearance, the size of the object seemed to be less than the angle of a matchheas thumb, both had the magnitude of a gull or hawk at a distance. I am puzzled. Both the shape and object moved from west to east and affect more pronounced from northeast to southwest, both had the magnitude of a gull or hawk at a distance.
