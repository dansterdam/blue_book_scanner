Janesville, Wisconsin
Feb. 7, 1965

Dear Sir,

I am writing to you to inform you of an incident that happened in our town on the 24th of January, 1965. But first, I would like to state that I could not make up my mind just what to explain in detail, because of the fact that I did not see the object myself, but rather how to explain it. I send herewith a sketch of how it appeared to a neighbor, and I hope this will help to explain what is the story. 

This neighbor of mine was doing some work in his yard when he noticed an object up in the sky. The tail of the object, which seemed to him to be somewhat triangular in shape, was a flashing blue light. The tail was about twice as long as the width of the object itself.

Incidentally, this neighbor of mine was lying down (somewhat like a plane or flying saucer pilot, rather) when he noticed the object. He states that it moved from the southeast to the northwest and then back again, and that it emitted a high-pitched whine that he could hear. The game was going towards the horizon.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
