AUG 21 1957

This refers to your recent correspondence concerning your unidentified flying object (UFO) on February 21, 1957. Please excuse the delay in replying; however, because of our busy schedule, it is sometimes difficult to answer as promptly as we would like.

Although we are unable to positively identify the object, we do believe the details you could have been responsible for your sighting. At that time, Venus would have been on an almost 23 3/4 degree azimuth at an elevation of approximately 11 degrees, which would have coincided with your sighting. If it were Venus, it would have been the brightest object in the sky, scheduling the eclipsi ng of the brightest stars and planets.

One reason for its unique appearance when viewed through the telescope, according to astronomers, might be caused by the atmosphere, which tends to cause distortion. The violet light is refracted farther from the lens, while the red light is focused more, thus giving the object a colored halo.

This offer is only a possible explanation. Upper atmospheric conditions can sometimes affect the way objects are seen or actually motion.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

BARRETT R. YOUNG
