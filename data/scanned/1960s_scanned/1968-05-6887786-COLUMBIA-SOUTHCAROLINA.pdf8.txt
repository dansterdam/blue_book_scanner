There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As an OCR system, the text I can extract from the document is:

TDPT (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/ana/29 Aug 68
PHOTOGRAPH OF UFO
Golumbia, South Carolina 29206

1. This refers to your letter of July 8, 1968 in which you enclosed a negative of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

2. Photo analysis indicates that the film submitted exhibits one large and one small water spot which were undoubtedly incurred during processing of the negative.

3. Thank you for forwarding the negative to the Air Force for analysis; your original negative is included.

VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR, Lt Colonel, USAF  
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office 
Aerospace Technologies Division
