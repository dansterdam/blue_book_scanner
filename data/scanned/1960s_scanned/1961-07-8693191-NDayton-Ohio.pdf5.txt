20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end, to show the direction of motion during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. How did it look to you? Hold a watch, stick, or pencil a length in line with a known object and note the angle subtended by the object. If you find confirmed this experiment, use the result.
