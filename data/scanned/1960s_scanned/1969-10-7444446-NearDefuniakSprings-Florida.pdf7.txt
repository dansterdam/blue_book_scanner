There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing only text and no visual elements.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the following output based on the text in the document:

2. DATE AND TIME OF SIGHTING: 
3. LOCATION OF OBSERVER: NEAR DEFUNIAK SPRINGS, FLORIDA
