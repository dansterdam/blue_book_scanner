CASE OFFICER'S FINAL REPORT
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
1. SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
On 7 July 1968, USAF personnel at Eielson AFB, Alaska, reported sighting an unidentified flying object. The object was first observed at approximately 2356 hours local time and was tracked on radar for several minutes. The object was described as a bright light in the western sky, maneuvering in an erratic manner, and at times appeared to stop and hover. No audible sound was associated with the object.
2. DETAILS OF SIGHTING:
The sighting was reported by A1C Doyle H. Summerfield, 354th Security Police Squadron, Eielson AFB, Alaska. At approximately 2356 hours local time, A1C Summerfield, while on patrol, observed a bright light in the western sky. The object appeared to be maneuvering in an erratic manner, with rapid changes in direction and speed. At times, the object appeared to stop and hover. No sound was associated with the object. A1C Summerfield immediately notified the Command Post, which in turn alerted the Weapons Control Center.
The Weapons Control Center was able to track the object on radar for several minutes. The radar tracking confirmed the visual sighting, indicating that the object was approximately 15-20 miles southwest of the base, at an altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 feet.
3. CONCLUSION:
After a thorough investigation, this incident remains unidentified. The object's erratic maneuvers and high speed were not characteristic of any known aircraft or natural phenomenon. The radar confirmation of the visual sighting lends credibility to the report. The case is therefore classified as an UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
