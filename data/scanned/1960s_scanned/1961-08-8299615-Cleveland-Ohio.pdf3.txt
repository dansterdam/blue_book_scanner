The image does not contain any photographs or visual information. It appears to be a scanned document page from a Project Blue Book UFO report.

The text in the document reads as follows:

The UFOS were observed on two different occasions by Mr. and his verified the reports that all UFOS disappeared about the same distance from the sun.

The size of the objects, the shape, and if the surfaces were smooth or rough could not be determined.
