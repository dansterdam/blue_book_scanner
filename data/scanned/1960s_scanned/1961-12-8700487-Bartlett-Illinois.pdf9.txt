Gentlemen,

Would you please send me a copy of the pamphlet on the Unidentified Flying Objects? The reason I'm asking is because me and my two children were the only witnesses of a small bright object which flew over our house on a Sunday evening. My husband was not at home, and I thought it was a little strange, but I paid no special attention until Tuesday evening when I ready my daily paper and saw that there were reports of sightings in our immediate vicinity. At the Western City, from our residence.

At approximately a height of about ten feet long, from this distance with a small pir of twinkling like stars. The larger we are not able to observe it closely more than a minute or so, as it disappeared from us rapidly and we lose sight of it entirely.

Thank you and the prompt attention in direction, I am,

Yours truly,
