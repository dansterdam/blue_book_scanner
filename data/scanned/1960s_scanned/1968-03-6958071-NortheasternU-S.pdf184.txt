zenith. Hence an excellent direction of motion and azimuth of the radiant is obtained, but determining the heights are more troublesome as few usable reports came from well to the side. Fortunately, the report from SHB, Oliver Springs, Tennessee, by _ of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is most complete. His diagram shows that the object grazed Moon's lower limb. As we already had the path's azimuth this gives an excellent height near the beginning point. We were even more fortunate in that Professor J.F. Phillips, Florence State College, Florence Alabama, was using a 6-inch telescope pointed to U Venus, and had the body cross its field. While we take in the beginning point. The two corresponding heights are 74.0 km and 74.2 km respectively. We assume therefore, that H1 is 74.1 km. For the end point at STP, Hubbard, Ohio, gave an excellent drawing of the path on a star map showing that it ended at E Bootis. This gives H2 as 37.6 km. The average of 5 other altitudes which seem reasonably good also gives H2 as 37.6 km. So we assume H2 was 37.5 Â± 13.1 km. There were numerous other estimates of altitudes but many observers were so near the vertical plane of the path that the altitudes error in estpnate would affect the heights greatly. Some even referred the path to certain stars, we take the projected path length as 1122 km. Due to the excessively small inclination the true length can be assumed as the same. It is quite possible that the body was some.
