POTTSTOWN MERCURY

(2)

I spent a good half hour explaining to Capt. Underwood the details of the craft I observed. 

In a nutshell, what I did observe was not a conventional aircraft. If weather balloons are lighted and have lights, this creature was not. It had a circular shape and yellow color and seemed to change directions. The wind at that time was blowing from the southwest, and the craft was traveling against the wind. However, I assume that it is a lower level craft as a higher level could probably be differed than that at a lower level. I also assume that the craft could have been hit by a sudden Thunderstorm which could have caused its erratic movements.

I would fill out your form if I thought for a minute that it would help. But I don't.

My own philosophy is against believe in UFOs as outlined in the enclosed column written by me. But recently I have had to conclude that there is something up there.

So many people have seen too many things too suddenly for me to accept a mass hysteria theory.

They can hardly explain themselves let alone explain what it is.

I appreciate the courtesy that Capt. Underwood showed me. He was the only representative of the Air Force who like what an Air Force officer should represent.

If I can be of any concrete help, please feel free to contact me.
