January 10, 1968

At approximately 5:30 P.M. my housebands and I observed an object in the east above the horizon. My husband and I were standing in the parking lot behind our apartment building (Route Village, Vails Gate, New York). The object, from our viewpoint, seemed to hover above the size of Venus, appeared to move above the horizon and then move towards us. It was yellow in color and occasionally seemed to flash red. Again it appeared to stop and hover, and then moved slightly to the south (to our right in the face of east). As we watched, it completely disappeared from view. In five to ten seconds the object reappeared far to the south - much farther than any conventional aircraft or satellite could have gone. I have ever observed could have moved in that short time.

I ran into our apartment and called.
