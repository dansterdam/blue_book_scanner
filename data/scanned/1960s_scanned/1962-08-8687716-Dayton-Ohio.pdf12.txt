The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs, but rather consists of a typewritten letter and a hand-drawn diagram.

The text in the document is as follows:

HEADQUARTERS
FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
DAYTON, OHIO

TD-B/LD Col Friend
UFO Sighting

Dayton, Ohio

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Please complete the enclosed CD Form 13 on your sighting and return
to this office for further evaluation. Your cooperation in furnishing
this form is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

HOWARD H. MAIN
Colonel, USAF

and Cognizance

The hand-drawn diagram appears to be a simple schematic or layout, but without any descriptive text, I cannot provide further details about its content.
