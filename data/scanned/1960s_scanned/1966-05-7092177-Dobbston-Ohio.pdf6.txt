By Taxi Driver

This report was written: 
S a.m. today that he had picked up a fare about 3 a.m. this morning who said he had seen a UFO.  The driver said the object was circular in shape and that as it hovered over the car, he spotted two UFOs a few days ago which led to attempt to get a better look.  He was unable to do so.
