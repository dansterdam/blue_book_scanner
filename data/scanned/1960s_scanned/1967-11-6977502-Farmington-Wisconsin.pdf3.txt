There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter dated March 29, 1967 from the publisher of "The Standard-Press" in St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin to the Chief of the Air Force.

The letter describes a reported incident where the writer's neighbor(s) observed a strange object in the sky and contacted the Osceola Air Force Base about it. The letter discusses the details of the sighting and the base's response, as well as the writer's request for more information on the incident.

Text from the document:

Dear Sir,

We wonder if you could give us any confirmation or information on a report on an object sighted over Osceola, Wisconsin on March 19, 1967. Osceola Air Force Base tells us that they are not in a position to confirm whether or not this object was tracked on their radar screens. 

The object, which was said to be unidentified, with lights steadily glowing, hovered about 100 yards above the ground, and was observed by several people for about 15 minutes. They attempted to contact it with a loudspeaker, but received no response. The object then disappeared from sight.

We are also reported that their radio stopped dead suddenly, and that their car started rolling into the area. This incident occurred on a farm within 20 miles of the Osceola Air Force Base.

When these people sighted the object and showed the Air Force base, the men on duty told them that they were not to go outside the fence, or they could see the strange light over the farm.

Could you possibly make any comment for the newspaper about this report? Would you be willing to tell us if the object was tracked on the radar screens?

Thank you for any information you can give us.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
