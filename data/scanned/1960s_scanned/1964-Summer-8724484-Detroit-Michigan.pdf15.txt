June 30, 1964

Dear Mr. Bloomfield,

This is in response to your letter of June 23, 1964 concerning the reported information on several unidentified flying object sightings during the past month.

Enclosed is a summary of information on the security and other related aspects of the recent unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings, but unfortunately project Blue Book does not have pictures or physical evidence to provide. The summary is based on evaluations through the analysis conducted by our scientific consultants in an attempt to be as responsive as possible to your request.

To the best of our knowledge, the incidents described have been resolved. We are limited in our ability to make our complete investigative files available, due to the sensitivity of the information and the need to protect the sources involved. However, I assure you that the information prepared is warranted and summarized as accurately as possible.

Sincerely,

EASTON M. JACKES
