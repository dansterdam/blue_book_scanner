The subject of Unidentified Flying Objects more logically belongs in an intelligence center. My reasons for saying this are these: I think it is simply clear by now that there are highly reliable reports of objects in the earth's atmosphere that are quite incredible from the ordinary point of view. These reports are coming in from all over the world and include some very interesting examples of meteorological and atmospheric optics phenomena - such as light phenomena, reflections, etc. - that are worthy of study in themselves.

I do not think, however, that these objects should be kept quite separate from the air force's own scientific study of the upper atmosphere because, after all, the military is largely responsible for the public awareness of this phenomenon in the first place. And of course, the old arguments about value or the office of scientific research and public relations, etc., still remain.

It is not to be maintained that there is necessarily any parallel between the stones that fall from heaven and the many artificial satellites that now circumnavigate the world. However, it seems to me that the urgency for the nation to keep track of potentially hostile objects in the air, and the importance of properly assembling and evaluating the intelligence should be brought to the cognizance of scientific circles so that greater weight may be given to such considerations.

I do, therefore, recommend that consideration be given to the transfer of the scientific aspects of the Unidentified Flying Object problem to the Directorate of the Air Force Research Directorate or another appropriate scientific division or the Air Force.
