At 1235, 10 December 68, Nancy Jones received a collect call from a Nancy Guntle from Fort Recovery, Ohio. She said her husband was very upset over a UFO they had seen the night before. She said her husband said just about the time it was dark they saw this huge bright light hovering over their house. They watched it for some time, her husband said it just hovered there, first on one side and then on the other. It was so bright they could not look at it directly. She said after awhile it moved off in a rapid motion towards the east and was gone. She said her husband was very upset and could not sleep that night. She said she thought there might be some information that could be obtained if someone could come and talk to them about it. She was told to have her husband call this office if he wished to talk about what they saw.

She said the phone was listed under Dan Guntle. She said she could be reached at this number from after 7:30 until 8:00 in the morning. She stated if we had to get in touch with her after that we could reach her where she works.

(Fort Recovery is on the western border of Ohio.)
