The image appears to contain a handwritten sketch or drawing depicting a scene in the sky. The drawing shows several stars or bright objects in the sky, with two bright objects that seem to be the main focus of the drawing. There is also some text written below the drawing.

However, as there are no identifiable human faces in the image, I will proceed to extract the text from the document as requested:

April 19, 1965.
A.F.O. report. 
The object that we had seen was a good-sized, bright white object. It was a perfect circle, some kind of rim or edge around it. When we first saw it, it was about 8,000 ft. high and in a northwesterly direction. The object seemed to be moving quite slowly, apparently along a east-west direction. Then all of a sudden it just disappeared, it seemed to go out of sight, like a light going out. It was up for a good while, maybe 10 or 15 minutes, then it just went out. We waited and watched a while to see if it would come back, but it did not. If it would have been an airplane or something, we would have heard some noise. But there was no sound at all. We were quite surprised, especially when it disappeared so quickly. 
If it would have been some kind of moving star, it would have kept going, but this just disappeared, like a light going out. We have been in the military service for quite a while and have seen a lot of strange things in the sky, but never anything like this before. It was really quite an experience and we were both very much surprised and puzzled over what we had seen. We watched the sky very closely after that, but it did not come back.
