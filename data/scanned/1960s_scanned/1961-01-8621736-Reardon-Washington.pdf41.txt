There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

13. Did you attempt to photograph the object?
Yes, but they were too far away and all I would have gotten was a light, so I did not attempt to photograph the object.

13a. Were the sightings all made from the confines of the "middle" site?
No.

15. What was your nearest witness distance to the object?
From four feet to three quarters of a mile on one occasion.

16. List any other information pertaining to the sightings:
There was a complete absence of sound. There were no light rays from the lights, and there was no heat from the bottom. It had a pulsing sound.

17. Suppose you were able to place an object in the sky at a particular time. What type of an object would you construct that would account for the lights that you saw. What information can you give regarding the lights?
On one occasion a triangular red light, and a round white light with no rays and no apparent source. On another occasion just a lantern flashlight hanging in the air with nothing around it, not with the rays, and very bright. On another occasion like a large round board with a round fluorescent light around it to the bottom.
