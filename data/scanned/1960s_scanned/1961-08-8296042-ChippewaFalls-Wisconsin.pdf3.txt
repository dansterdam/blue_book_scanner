Now the sighting took place so what happened is
we were camping at about a 75 angle to the observing
vehicle. The light or object in the air came
from the south and then turn to the east, then we
noticed it appeared to be divided into three distinct
parts, equally spaced, and yet we thought it was not
a real object but seemed to be shaped like an ear of
corn. The light divided and made the three separate
and distinct parts. I can't say much about the color 
except it was not bright or glaring but of a mellow
kind of light and it moved rather slowly in relation
to the speed one would expect of a shooting star or
flare. It was not a conventional object and definitely
not a meteor or flare. We watched it for several min-
utes as it proceeded slowly across the sky moving east-
ward. We are quite certain it was not an aircraft or
any known conventional object. There was no noise
whatsover and the light appeared to be under some
intelligent control as it made an abrupt turn and sep-
arated into three distinct parts. This is the substance
of our report.
