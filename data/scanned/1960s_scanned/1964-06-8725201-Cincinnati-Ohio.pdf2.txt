Dear Sir:

Your recent letter to the Commander at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was referred to this project because of its relation to our activities. 

The Project Office has determined that you are correct in your sighting of some unknown aerial phenomenon on September 3, 1954. The details and the descriptions are all consistent with other similar reports received from that area.

Enclosed is a summary of information on Project Blue Book and the program for dealing with aerial phenomena of this type. We think this brochure will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

MAJOR M. JACKS
Public Information Division
