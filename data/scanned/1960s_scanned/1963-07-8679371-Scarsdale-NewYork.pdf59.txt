Sighted UFO
From the Sunderland Standard:
August 31st. A person, whom I interviewed, reported that at 10:15 p.m. that evening, he had seen a bright light manoeuvring at speed in the sky over West Rainton. He could see no shape or structure, only a bright light. The light appeared to be quite low in the sky in the area of Tunstall Hills and Green.
Here are some additional details from the witness:
He estimated the light to be about 3 miles away and about 1,000 feet high. The light moved in a straight line for a while, then suddenly changed direction at a very high speed. 
Within about 2 minutes the light had disappeared from sight. Neither he nor the other witness with him could tell what the object was.
Their sighting: Probably a fast moving aircraft or helicopter from Sunderland airfield.
Other witnesses: Possibly some.
