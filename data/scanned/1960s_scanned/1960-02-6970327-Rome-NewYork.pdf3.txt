The document does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a textual article from the "Science News Letter" discussing the visibility of planets in the morning sky during February 1960.

PLANETS STILL IN MORNING SKY
Uranus and Pluto will be at their closest points to earth for 1960 during February. However, Mercury and Saturn, which is faintest, will be visible in the evening without some kind of optical aid. 
If you want to see a planet on February 22, with the help of a small telescope or binoculars, you will have the best chances of observing the planets as they appear in the morning sky. Mercury and Saturn will be visible, but other planets are more distant and more difficult to see.
As the month progresses, the visible morning planets will be fewer. Uranus and Pluto will be closest to Earth in February, but they will be too small and faint to see without a large telescope. Venus, Jupiter, and Mars remain visible in the morning sky, but they are very distant. By the end of February, they will be at their closest points for this year and will appear brighter in the morning. A large telescope is needed to observe Uranus and Pluto, and their positions are given.
The article also discusses the motion of Mercury and its visibility in the evening sky.
