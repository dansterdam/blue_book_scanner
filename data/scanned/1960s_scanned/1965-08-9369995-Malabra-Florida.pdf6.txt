MOTION PICTURE OF UFO IN FLORIDA: An article from the Gainesville (Florida) Sentinel, dated September 21st, tells of a man named James B. Peak who photographed a UFO within seconds of the recent Gemini 5 take-off. Peak was watching the blastoff from his home not far from Cape Kennedy when he noticed an object traveling at very high speed, moving in a westerly direction in the vicinity of the launch area. He said it looked like a "pillar of brilliant green phosphorescent light," just east of the contrail left by the Gemini 5 rocket. Peak hastily alerted his 3 sons, and they took some color footage before the object vanished toward the south. Upon getting the film back from the processor, he was that he had been more successful than he thought. The film shows not one but three brilliant objects in motion.

Saucer contention happens, also lives near Cape Kennedy, sent a letter to the Air Force indicating he had interviewed Mr. Peak, but arrived a couple of hours too late, as the Air Force had already picked up the film. Peak expects to get his gyro back from the Air Force, and will then notify Manger, who has promised to notify us. See the letter at the top of Page 5 for more recent information about this case.
