Dear Maj. Quintilie, 
I would like some information on UFO signal around Memphis, Tenn.
I am a Lt. and a member of 11 years standing of the Civilian flying club and was very interested in UFOs.
On 6 stood March 1967 my friend (name redacted) and I were were at 9:00 PM at his home observed a very bright and near silent light moving in an erratic fashion at a very high speed. It could not be any known aircraft. We watched it for some 20 minutes as it moved from west to east across the sky. After going behind some trees it seemed to stop and move back and forth. Then it took off at a terrific rate of speed and was lost to sight. Very anxious to get some information on this or any other similar sightings around that area. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely, 
(Redacted)
