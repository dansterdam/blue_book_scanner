he has engaged in high-energy physics, using the 6 Billion electron volt Bevatron at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. His main efforts have been concentrated on the development and use of large liquid hydrogen bubble chambers, and on the development of high-speed devices to measure and analyze the millions of photographs produced each year by the bubble chamber complex. The net result of this work has been the discovery by Dr. Alvarez's research group, of a large number of previously unknown fundamental particle resonances.

William E. Humphrey received the Ph.D. degree in physics from the University of California (Berkeley) in 1961 and joined the physics staff of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. Since that time he has been engaged in elementary particle physics research in the development of data analysis equipment and techniques. He has seven publications on physics and five publications on data analysis techniques.
