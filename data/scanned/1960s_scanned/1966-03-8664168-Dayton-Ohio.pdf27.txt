Dear Major Quintanilla:

The photos inclosed belong to Life and were lent to one of our people by one of their for a personal favor with this stipulation - we must return them quickly.

At the same time, we are still committed to Congress to analyze these photos.

Would you make copies, return the originals (which are really copies of the originals) as quickly as possible, and use your copies for your analysis.

Hopefully, Miss's theories, published lately, can explain these photos?

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
