The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a diagram or sketch related to a UFO sighting. The diagram includes instructions for the observer to sketch the path and movement of the observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that shows the highest the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the lowest point on the curve where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
