The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, likely containing a report or observations related to a UFO incident.

As per your request, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

1 - AREA: 25 - 30 miles about 20 - 25 Kgs to the west of CRESTVIEW, FLA. A picture was taken of a 50 at CRESTVIEW, FLA. It was forwarded to ATIC. I wonder if it is the UFO seen on the day 12 May 1962. The picture was taken by a CIVILIAN, Capt. ARMSTRONG called Cross Bay. They had all their operations suspended by the Intelligence.
