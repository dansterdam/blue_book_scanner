There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Transcription of the text in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes. When it appeared to stop for a short time, it suddenly "took off" and disappeared quickly.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what was behind it.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what was in front of it.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - No sound that I could hear
b. Color - Appeared to be silvery in color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Probably the whole object

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially outline trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.
