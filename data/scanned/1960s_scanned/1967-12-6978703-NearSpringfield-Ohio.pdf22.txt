The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text in the document is as follows:

NO CASE INFORMATION ONLY  11 December 1967, Germany

TDPT (UFO)
UFO Reporting Guidance
TDPT
TDA (DEPT OPR)
TO AUG

This document discusses guidance for reporting UFOs. It mentions that the Detachment 3 office responsible for UFO reports is not seeking UFO reports, as it appears that the Detachment has a political problem and this office has been advised to change its stance. The document also states that TDPT cannot offer any guidance for the investigation of UFOs in continental Europe because AFR 80-17 is not seeking UFO reports which occur outside the continental limits of the United States.

The document is signed by MAJOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office, Aerospace Technologies Division.
