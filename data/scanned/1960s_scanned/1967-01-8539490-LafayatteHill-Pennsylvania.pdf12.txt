The document is dated February 13, 1967 and is addressed to a party interested in seeing the photographs taken of the object. The letter indicates that the photographs are not included and that the details of the sighting are not too distant.

You may be interested in seeing the photographs which I took of the object I saw. As I stated before, the object came from the northwest or north-northeast, to the best of my knowledge. William Greve at a station in northwest or Lafayette Hill and I were the only ones who saw it. It is not too distant.

Yours truly,
