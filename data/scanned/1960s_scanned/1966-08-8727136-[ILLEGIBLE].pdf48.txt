The image appears to contain a page from a Project Blue Book document. There is no photograph present, only a hand-drawn sketch of an object above the horizon and a compass rose. 

The text on the page reads:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place on "C" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place on "A" where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were.
