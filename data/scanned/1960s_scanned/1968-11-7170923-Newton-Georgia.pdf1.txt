The image appears to contain a grainy black and white photograph, likely taken from a UFO sighting report. The photograph does not depict any human faces, so I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Witness encountered a brilliant object in the sky which hovered briefly about 200 feet ahead of him and then faded into static. The object itself emitted a beam-shaped light of its own. Radio interference was detected as if the beam was attempting to communicate. The object disappeared in a few seconds. A second object was detected by the witness left in the drive gear.
