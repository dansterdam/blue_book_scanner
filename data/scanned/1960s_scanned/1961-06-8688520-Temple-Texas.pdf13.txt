On June 8, 1961, about 10:30 p.m. or a little after, I saw what appeared to be the silhouette of a man or human figure outlined against the bright sky with a bright white light on top of the head, and there appeared to be a smaller light or glow around the figure.  The figure seemed to be standing still, and gave the impression of being about 200 yards distant from where I was standing.  After observing the figure for about 20 seconds, it seemed to just disappear into the night sky.
