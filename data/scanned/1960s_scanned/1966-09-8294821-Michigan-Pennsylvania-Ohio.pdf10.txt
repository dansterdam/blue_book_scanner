1. The information (which appears to be an approximation) is given in CDC 0099, which appears to be an approach to a radar sighting in the Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio area during the time of this sighting. No supplemental radar information is available. It is deemed that the two occurrences are one and the same.
2. Many articles have been written confirming the fact that military pilots and planes now provide a precise radar return. This ionized cloud may have been an elusive track, (perhaps an anomalous propagation) and may have given an approximate target return according to the report.
