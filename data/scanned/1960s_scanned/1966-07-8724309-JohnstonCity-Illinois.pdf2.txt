Dear Major Quintanilla,

I am interested in the UFO phenomena and would like a copy of the Project Blue Book, Project Grudge, and Project Bluebook reports, and any other data you can regularly send, and also a copy of U.F.O. investigations (1951) and other related information.

Yours truly,

P.S. Also additional copies of these forms from Richard, your writing indicated a good target. I need to have it identified because it is a mistake! It would be a good target.
