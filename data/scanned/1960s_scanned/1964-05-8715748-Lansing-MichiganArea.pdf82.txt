"As page 2 shows, a call was received from a [REDACTED] Lansing, residence (State Police headquarters), reporting a sighting of what appears to be the same object that [REDACTED] saw.

He was emphatic about the fact that he had never seen such a strange object in all his life. He was reluctant to talk about it, expressing some regret that he 'had ever "opened his mouth" about it. The investigator had a slight impression his excitement had perhaps not immediately subsided as it the object was so strange - his apparent agitation seemed out of proportion to the sighting of a bright meteor, but may, of course, have been due only to the fact that his experience was being investigated.

He and his wife were interviewed. These witnesses had been riding in an open convertible about three miles south-west of [REDACTED] location, at about the same time ([REDACTED]), and were on an interchange of [REDACTED] 36 at the Cedar Street entrance, headed south, a pre-medital student, just finishing his senior year, saw the object for the longest time his wife, alerted by his exclamation, just caught a glimpse of it before it winked out. He first noticed it. Its elevation was between 20 and 30 degrees. It was judged later to be as bright as Venus, perhaps brighter (Venus was approximately as resplendent 2-3 than the same color). It moved silently the same color as white lights the object moved to the north through an arc of about thirty degrees, lasting about three seconds. At the out of this time, the light suddenly got out, trailing a shower of sparks, disappearing in about 2 seconds.
