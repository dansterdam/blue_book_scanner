AS TO THE HEIGHT IN THE SKY. These 3 boy- were to the east of me along the side of the road watching the thing and as far as I could gauge it, it was pretty well up in the sky, so I said that they were pointing up in the sky so I said "that's what they are looking about and just as I was about to get out, the car I looked up-nearly straight up-it was still going in this direction, pretty high up, and it seemed to be headed north, back where I was coming from. I couldn't say for sure how high it was but I would judge it to be still going at an altitude of certainly as much as 2 to 3000 feet and the way it was going, I would say that as far as we could tell. it seemed to be headed north.
