Transcribed text:

Regarding this was the time when an official report, I took the house to go over it. I had observed. One of the girls, who was here very within, frightened and hardly a similar to describing to see this. So I gather to take a look although I told her about this, she said she'd be so. I asked a blurb red twice, so that he who was who I said had to be at 11 o'clock. This is the reception which was later recorded and seen us when we returned from the light, which was the size of a small plane and also had close to the lights, (at the time David was a gape. Something had happened)

Later as Amatins said (that) observer, I have a very clear again about what happened here. About 1:30 A.M. it came closer to the house and they flashed a bright into some nearby trees. But they just quickly missed them. They did not seem to our house. They just asked if they were not bright. It was lighted. I said there would have a sound distinct before, when it began to take somewhere else. "
Soon said when the object sped away it traveled toward the north-east. As it moved, it seemed to disappear into a course toward the north-northeast, covering the distance in very short time. No more than 200 feet.

I asked what unusual feelings had he when he observed this. He said, nothing unusual except this he was strongly impressed that this was intently, but he could not explain it. The intensity of the light burning was almost intolerable. It was so bright, it was difficult t looking at it. To the strong attraction it had on him, it was an oxobat.
