The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document discussing the regulations covering UFO reports according to AFR 200-2. The document provides some general guidance on how to handle UFO sightings, including encouraging prompt reporting and thorough investigation of any sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 299-2. Refer to it if you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn in this form with your DD report in the morning.

One final note: Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings which are obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the CIAC. But if the evidence seems more than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help the Air Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.
