The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an optical character recognition (OCR) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY 
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS

The text appears to be a handwritten letter or note from the Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
