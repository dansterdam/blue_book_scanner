14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it, so how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the match is covered by the object. If you had performed this measurement, note the result.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you may have observed, such as size, proportions, etc., and especially aircraft or other trails or fumes. Please be as accurate as possible.
