There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report titled "Unidentified Flying Object Report". The text in the document is as follows:

SW3 
17 November 1965
Unidentified Flying Object Report

From (TDEW) 
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

The attached report was received by our Information Services Office, although the date time group of occurrence is generally some 1813 with the attachment containing instructions.

I have no idea what this might be.
