Gentlemen:

Since the object sighted in the sky near Beckley, W. Va., about 1:30 A. M. on June 6 appears to be arousing considerable interest, I have decided to make a full report of this observation for your consideration.

I was driving about one mile from Mt. Hope, W. Va., at the time 1:27, and observed a bright light in the sky which seemed to be hovering at a short distance to the right or and slightly below the moon. It appeared to be about the size of the moon, but with a more intense light.  The object appeared in the direction of Beckley, which was southwest of my position. It seemed to hover at a constant altitude for several minutes, and then appeared to move through the sky at about the same speed as "shooting star" which I have observed on many occasions. The object was observed in various directions at the same speed as the original object. The total time of observation was about 3 or 4 seconds.  Prior to and after the sighting there were no unusual sounds or sights observed.

My reaction at the time of observation was (and still is) that the object was (1) an unusually large meteo r, (2) a satellite launching up in the sky, or (3) "ball" lightning (if there is such a thing).
