There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a typed written description of a sighting.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.
ALL ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS OF THE OBSERVATIVE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SIGHTING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.

The objects were seen at 11:30 pm, moving from South to North. 
The main object ejected two smaller objects which circled the bigger object twice. One of the smaller objects came very close to the ground ahead of me, remained there for a few minutes, then went back up to rejoin its companion. After that, the two small objects disappeared inside the big object, and then the big object shot straight up at a 90 degree angle and disappeared. The sighting lasted about 20 minutes, and the big object, before ejecting the smaller objects, hovered very low over the ground.
