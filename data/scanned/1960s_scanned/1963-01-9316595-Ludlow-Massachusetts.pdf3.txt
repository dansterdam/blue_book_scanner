THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY THE OBSERVERS APPEARS EQUATE TO AN AIRCRAFT FLIGHT PATH. HOWEVER, THE RED FUELAGE LIGHT BLINKS AND THIS WAS DENIED BY THE OBSERVERS. THE T-33 FLIGHT OBSERVER COULD NOT HAVE CAUSED THIS REPORT DUE TO THE DIRECTION OF TAKEOFF AND TRAFFIC PATTERN. SATELLITES ARE HELD UNLIKELY DUE TO THE NORTHWARD MOTION OF THE OBJECT.
