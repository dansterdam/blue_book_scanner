The image does not contain any photograph, only a typed letter. I will now proceed to transcribe the text from the document:

February 12, 1964

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This is in reply to your letter of February 6, 1964. This office received your request for information on an unusual phenomena you witnessed last January 29, 1964.

It is difficult to evaluate what the object is described in your letter or its significance. This office does not conduct detailed investigations or make analyses on color, shape, or other such descriptive aspects of reported phenomena. However, we have had previous reports on the nature which was investigated in an attempt to determine the facts involved. An evaluation of a matter of this type requires an in-depth study which this office is unable to make.

It is appreciated your report of this sighting and it is regretted that a more enlightening answer cannot be given.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACOBS
Major, USAF
Public Information Division
