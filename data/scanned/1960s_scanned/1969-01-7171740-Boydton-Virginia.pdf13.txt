Transcript of text from the document:

Was a guy who reported an unidentifiable flying object near Boydton, Virginia, on 7 January 1969. The object was sighted at approximately 7:30 PM and was described as circular in shape, hovering in the sky, and occasionally emitting flashing lights. The witness reported that the object was maneuvering silently and appeared to be about the size of a basketball at arm's length. No other details are provided in the handwritten remarks.
