The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book. The text on the page appears to be handwritten information provided in response to a questionnaire.

All of the text found in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: May 4 1962
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

All of this info was in the report that I turned in before, but I turned in so much that they may have overlooked some of it. About the object I sighted - it was a sort of metallic, bright object that turned in Bosque and stopped abruptly, then went out of sight to the east. It made no sound at all, and was quite large in size. The report I made at the time is about 15 or so pages long and goes into great detail about the occurrence. Anyway, this is all I have to add to the previous report.
