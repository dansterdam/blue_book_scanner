MEMO FOR THE RECORD

SUBJ: UFO OBSERVATIONS, 22 June 1968
Lt. Colonel called me regards to his aerial advertising plane.
Mr. was flying in the area of Miamisburg, Franklin, West Carrollton 
and Kettering on the night of 22 June 1968 and was over Franklin at approximately 
10:30 PM on 22 June 1968. His plane was visible for approximately 15 miles
distance. He was advertising for Steueve Ford of Miamisburg for their sentinel.
He said that his plane was in the area for the Mt. Healthy sighting
that we had written about. He didn't know if his plane was in the area 
for the other sighting since he didn't know the exact location of it. We
told him it was about 20 miles up river from Cincinnati. He said that his
plane is visible for approximately fifteen miles in the distance and that
he had been operating as far east of Cincinnati as Mt Washington. Lt Marano
said that we would write him a short note listing some of the towns in the
area of the sighting.
