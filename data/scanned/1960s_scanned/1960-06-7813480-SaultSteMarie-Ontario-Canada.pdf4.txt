The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a motion picture film that was carefully analyzed and prints were made of the frames containing the image. According to the text, the image shows the contrails of a high-altitude object that was noted in the sky, and the contrails appeared to form a rectangular shape which then became circular as the object progressed. The text also mentions that the image may have been caused by a lens aberration when the lens was exposed to direct sunlight.

1. The attached motion picture film was carefully analyzed and prints were made of the frames containing the image.

2. As Mrs. --------- was taking motion pictures of the contrails in the sky, an image was filmed which later appeared to form a rectangular image. The light rays then appeared to form a circular image, and as the image progressed the rectangular image became circular and the detail of the image was almost lost.

3. It should be noted that the contrails moved from top to bottom of the frames indicating motion in the camera.

4. The image may have been caused by a lens aberration when the lens was exposed to direct sunlight.
