Dear Sir:

On Monday, September 12, at approximately 8:35 P.M., I saw an object in the sky which I could not identify. I would like to point out that I am 17 years old and have been intensely interested in all aeronautical items since I was 9 years old. I receive an aerospace magazine called Techno-logy Week, and I am applying now to enter the Air Force Academy. I saw all of this only to point out the validity of my observation. I live in San Bernardine, California, where Norton Air Force Base is located. There is a range of mountains north of the city which run west to east. I was looking at the sky towards the east when an object with the light intensity of a satellite came into my view heading north. Its speed was faster than any satellite that I have seen. It was also much slower than any meteor that I have seen. The object was traveling parallel with the ground and there was absolutely no sound that I could detect following the object. As I watched it head away from me, a small flare occurred behind the object for a second or two. Then from the white object a smaller red object descended from the front of the larger one to a short distance in front of it before I lost both in the haze towards the mountains. The red object just seemed to dive towards the ground, but this may have been due to the angle at which I was viewing it at that moment. I am positive I did not see an orbiting satellite or an airc raft .
