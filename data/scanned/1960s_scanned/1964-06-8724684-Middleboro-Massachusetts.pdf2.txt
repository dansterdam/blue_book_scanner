There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document.

31. Date you completed this questionnaire: 27 - 6 - 1964
32. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

A1 - A2 is the path taken by the first object sighted - a white-silver
A2 - A3 is the path taken by the next object sighted - a red
A3 - B1 is the path taken by the next object sighted - a white-silver

This has been the explanation of the motion sequence - following is an explanation of the printing figures.

A1 - B1 is the altitude of all of the white objects
A2 - B2 is the altitude of the red

These could not have been satellites because of how large they were - the largest objects were bright and bluish-green in color. They moved with incredible speed and made sharp changes in direction. By comparison I have never seen objects that could be compared to the object was nowhere near as fast or as maneuverable.
