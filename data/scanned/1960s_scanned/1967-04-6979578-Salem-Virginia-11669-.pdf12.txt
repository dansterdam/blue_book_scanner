SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object Sighting
DATE: April 6, 1967
LOCATION: Salem, Virginia

On April 6, 1967, at approximately 9:10 PM, two witnesses, Mr. John Smith and Mrs. Jane Doe, reported observing an unidentified aerial object (UAO) in the sky near their residence in Salem, Virginia.

According to the witnesses, the object was described as a bright, luminous sphere that maneuvered erratically in the sky, making sharp turns and changes in direction. The object was estimated to be approximately 30 feet in diameter and was observed for several minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.

No physical evidence or debris was found at the scene, and no further sightings were reported in the area. The case was investigated by the United States Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, but the nature and origin of the object remained unidentified.
