Minister Observes
Yellow Object

The Rev. S. Hillery of Tin 
City, Ohio, reports the following: On
August 17 at 9:30 p.m. he was traveling 
north on Route 77 near Wellston and
saw an object in the sky which appeared
to be large and directly ahead
of his car. The highway was empty and it
was very dark. The object appeared to be
about 30 ft. in diameter and was descending 
in a perfectly flat course. It
was traveling about 80 mph and was about
500 ft. from the ground. As it descended, 
it crossed the highway the Reverend
could see the light reflecting upon and 
that it seemed as if the object, but could
not see its shape or size. It appeared 
to be about 6 or 7 feet wide just above
the trees which were 50 to 60 ft. high.
When the object reached the lowest point in
its descent, it began to ascend in the same 
direction on a perfectly flat course. It 
was traveling so fast that it disappeared 
completely from view. He had obviously observed 
the light growing smaller as it proceeded away from him
and within a matter of 10 seconds it
was no longer visible in the distance. The car
window was down so he checked for
sound and there was none. The movement
was completely noiseless. He could find no explanation
for this object.
