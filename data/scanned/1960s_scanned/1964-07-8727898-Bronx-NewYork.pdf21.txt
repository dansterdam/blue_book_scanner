UFO

This letter is in reply to your letter of August 12, 1964, which further referred to your observation of several unidentified flying objects during the evening of August 29, 1964.

From the information in your letter, we have determined that you observed some unidentified flying objects that evening as previously mentioned. The possible solution to your observation does not seem to be evident and, therefore, needs further investigation.

Based on your detailed description of the objects, which you indicated appeared to be approximately 9:15 p.m. to 9:47 p.m. and which you observed from your home in New York City, that light, which has been previously sighted in this area during July 26th, July 30th, and July 31st, it was noted to be north of your position.

For the next few days, radio IF will be seen in the early morning hours over New York; however, who I may be can not be determined at this time between the house of 2 and 4 a.m.

20 Aug - Rcd SAPL from Singcqrly.
23 Aug - Got Sinokated based on memo from SAOT
