HICAP MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING SUBCOMMITTEE
13 Friend Court
Waltham, Massachusetts

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING - 1:25 - 2:3 a.m. 2/1/67 
NEAR: Sudbury Center, Massachusetts
DATE: 2 January 1967
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman, HICAP MASS SUBCOM
TO: HICAP 
Washington, D.C.

Enclosed is a UFO report that was not officially investigated but merely reviewed. The report is from a conscientious observer and contains details concerning an observation of unidentified aerial lights that were seen and observed over a period of one and one-half hours. The details suggest that these lights may have been of an extraterrestrial nature. However, the details are not sufficient to warrant a definite conclusion. Apparently a USAF investigation was conducted successfully with no further findings to report.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler (Chairman)
HICAP MASS SUBCOM

VERY SIMILAR TO BETTER SIGHTING OF CIGAR-SHAPED OBJECT AT CLOSE RANGE AT ARLINGTON POST. ON 10/29/54. CENTER OF GLOWING CIGAR.
