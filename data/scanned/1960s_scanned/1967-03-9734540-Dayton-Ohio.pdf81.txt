The image does not contain any photographs, only text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? IT DISAPPEARED OVER HORIZON

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound NONE
b. Color WHITE AND RED LIGHTS

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? MATCH HEAD WOULD COVER APPROXIMATELY 1/10 TO 1/20 OF OBJECT

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
NOTE: AS OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED COMING TOWARD US AND AS OBJECT WAS TO OUR SIDE, OUR SIDE VIEW IS SHOWING HOW OBJECT WAS TO OUR SIDE
