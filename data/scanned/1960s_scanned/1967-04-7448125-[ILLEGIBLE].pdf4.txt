There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this scanned document page from the Project Blue Book UFO report. The page contains only handwritten text.

Transcribing the text:

Precendent statement suggesting deregister and a as reference and confirmation of statements. This seems to be some sort of report or record, describing events or observations that were made. The text discusses the details and observations, and mentions terms like "sighting" and "my paper". However, without additional context, I cannot infer the specific nature or purpose of this document.
