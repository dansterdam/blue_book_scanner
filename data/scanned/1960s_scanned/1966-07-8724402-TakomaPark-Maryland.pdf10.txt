was that it was the low arrival and too light for a rain, it had rained previously the two red lights seemed to be illuminating the street and there appeared to be only two lights on the object. It moved slowly ant downward and then suddenly accelerated and literally disappeared from sight. I could see no details regarding any structure or outline other than the lights. I continued to watch the object in amazement. I had never seen anything like it before, and after a short time the object or lights simply disappeared. I told her about the object when I got home, but she claimed she had not seen anything. I continued in a steady course across the intersection. As said before, it was too low for a satellite, and the flight path did not indicate that it was a plane or helicopter. But the two bright red lights standing out on top, and one slightly lower than the other, and the fact that they seemed to function as spotlights illuminating the area underneath, definitely indicates that whatever it was, it was not an ordinary aircraft.

If you know anything of this day, gentlemen, I would appreciate your telling me any information you may have on it.
