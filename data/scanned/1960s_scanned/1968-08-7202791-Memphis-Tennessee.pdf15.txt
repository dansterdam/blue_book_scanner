It was a soft, not very brilliant light, never a beam, just a sort of diffused light that seemed to be suspended above the trees or woods, never came closer than a couple of hundred yards, just hovered there, like a diffused light, reddish in color, but not a brilliant red, very soft, seemed to glow, never changed shape or form or size, just maintained its position.
