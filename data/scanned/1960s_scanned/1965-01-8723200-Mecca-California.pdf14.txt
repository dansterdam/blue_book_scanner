VIRGINIA SHERIFF WARNS AGAINST SHOOTING SPACE VISITORS: On January 29th, the sheriff of Augusta County, Virginia, issued a warning to residents of 'little green men' This means that an alien spacecraft, or 'visitor' containing several small humanoid beings may have been seen in the county recently. A report of these days earlier by a farmer was investigated, and this thing has not gotten completely out of hand. The sheriff announced that anyone attempting to shoot at these visitors could count on prosecution and heavy penalties, as "interfering with these visitors in the county without good reason will be dealt with severely."
