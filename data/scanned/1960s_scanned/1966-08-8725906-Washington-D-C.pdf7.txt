PID (TICPTR)

12 September 1966

Dr. Donald H. Menzel 
Harvard College Observatory
Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138

Dear Dr. Menzel,

Reference your letter of 31 August 1966 requesting information on observations made by Dr. Hynek on 1 August 1966. We have a copy of Dr. Hynek's report and a copy is attached.

I am also enclosing the other reports which may have a bearing on the date from the Maryland area. Would it be possible to have your opinion on these sightings? I hope these are the materials you were referring to.

Sincerely,

J. Allen Hynek, Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
