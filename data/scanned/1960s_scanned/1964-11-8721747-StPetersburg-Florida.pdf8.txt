Jacks of the USAF's Directorate of Information Office, discussing various observations of unidentified flying objects reported during the period of 5-20 November 1964. The letter provides details on the observations, including the descriptions of the sightings, the time motion sequences, and the balloons or other phenomena that may have been mistaken for aircraft. The letter also mentions that the observations reported may or may not have been caused by the reported sightings.

Dear Miss Whitenour and Mrs. Hartmann:

We have received your reports from 5-20 November 1964 relating various observations of satellite-like objects.

On each item listed data presented for each observation was the possible to make a brief statement of the cause of the object: However, the detailed information presented could not have been caused by the passage of various satellite and/or space vehicles.

Reporting observations a certain minimum amount in is information that may include the description of the sightings, the time motion sequence if the objects were reported motions.

These objects reported may or may not be caused by the known phenomena. However, those sightings making definite turns and may have significant brighter than most of the sightings. Those sightings making definite turns and may have significant will probably be identified by the end of November.

The characteristics presented do not indicate a balloon observation, astronomical planets, or other phenomena. The object described was definitely not an airplane.

Sincerely,

HESTON M. JACKS
