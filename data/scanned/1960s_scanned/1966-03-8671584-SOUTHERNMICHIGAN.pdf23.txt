Text extracted from the document:

"He got out, planning to shut the door, and then looked around for the object, only to discover that the object was already to the rear of the car. This 4'4" object, if correct, would average out to the object proceeding at an average speed of 15 mph as it disappeared. Before proceeding with more details of these observations it would be best to examine the basic reports from the Hillsdale area because of the great similarity between them and this.

Case B - Hillsdale, Michigan
On Thursday, March 24th I traveled to Hillsdale with Ann Harbour and his driver to investigate the Hillsdale case. We called first at the home of [redacted] County Civil Defense Director and operator of the [redacted] Funeral Home. He has had several license  been in the Air Force, and is a very knowledgeable and efficient person. I talked with him at length about the sighting.
Mrs Van Horn made the first call, a report from the girls' dormitory, to the effect that there were blue, red and white lights visible from the dormitory near the ground. The director went to the back roof of his house and for 10 minutes scanned the skies and could see nothing. He did see a white light in the SW which he first mistook was stationary at first, but which appeared to change azimuth from 210 to 270 degrees. His wife and son David observed it for about 20 minutes. He said it wasn't a star and not an aircraft because it remained in the field of the binoculars for five minutes."
