Can one return to our cabin we noticed this unusual sightable light rather low on the sky. The sky was already getting dark around 8 PM. We watched it for a few minutes. It seemed to be moving rather erratical, moving in several directions. At times it appeared to stand still. We wonder whether it was some kind of a new aircraft or space vehicle. It was quite large in size and could be seen fairly well even though it was dusk. We lost sight of it after a while and it had moved far to the right. We could see it again and it had moved far to the right. It was a gain and it had moved fast to the night. I am sure that it might be the new military test.
