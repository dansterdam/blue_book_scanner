10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
Since the form 117 gives the date of the observation as 22 Dec 67 and states the objects sighting occurred at about 0100Z, this information does not seem to agree with the date and time group at the beginning of the report which gives the date as 01/0200Z. This information is insufficient to evaluated the sighting and provide a conclusion about the nature of the observed object.
