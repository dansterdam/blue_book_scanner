The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, specifically a questionnaire labeled "Official U.S. Air Force".

Text extracted from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
   2 3
    Day     Month      Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I have already filled out the form with full details of what I saw. The only thing additional I would like to add is that the object we saw was not a normal aircraft as we know it. It moved in an unusual manner - up, down, sideways - not like a plane. Also, the color was quite different from the normal planes we see. It was a bright luminous color, not the drab color of normal aircraft. The only time I have seen anything like it was one time when I did some flying, when we saw an unusual object in the sky that seemed to move in an unnatural way. I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter further as I feel it is quite important.
