The image contains no visible photograph, only handwritten text. As an OCR (optical character recognition) system, I will proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

Apparently I was the only one on board that saw it however when a looked the captain of the aircraft radio and tole him that I had seen the same thing and was reporting it on the radio.
