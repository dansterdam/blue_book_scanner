Para 3 Continuod: Then the mamoth plane came from the north at a shorp 900 angle and came at the building. We began to feel I had called the Pentagon and I thought it was one of our planes that had come to see what this was. It seems as if it was coming at us so we ran inside, out of the windows.

After this happened, the other two objects terminated west. Pentagon again (I always got the Command Post) and told they happened and thanked him for getting our plane out so fast. I don't go out at night. Those things are so enormous you can't count them. I can't sleep. I 42 pounds since Nov 20 when I first sighted them.
