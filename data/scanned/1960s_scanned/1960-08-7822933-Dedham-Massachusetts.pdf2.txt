There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a scanned page of an old document, specifically a letter from Warren W. McCurdy, Public Information, addressed to "Mr. ***" in Dedham, Massachusetts, dated September 15, 1960. The letter appears to be a response to an observation report and indicates that the matter is being forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center for further investigation.

Mr. Dedham, Massachusetts
