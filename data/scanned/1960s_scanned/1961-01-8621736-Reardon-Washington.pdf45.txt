CASE XXXXX-XXX REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

THEY APPEARED TO BE CIRCLING OR HOVERING OVER THE AREA. THEY SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 1,000 FEET IN THE AIR AND PASSED OUT OF SIGHT TO THE WEST. THE INFORMANT COULD NOT ESTIMATE THE SPEED OR SIZE OF THE OBJECTS BUT STATED THAT THEY APPEARED TO BE ROUND AND SEEMED TO BE GLOWING.

A CLOSE 'WATCH' WAS KEPT ON THE AREA BY MILITARY PERSONNEL AND CIVILIAN OBSERVERS FROM THAT TIME ON. NOTHING FURTHER WAS OBSERVED.
