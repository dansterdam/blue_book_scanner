The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document with a questionnaire or form related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. The text on the page contains questions about the observed object, such as whether it disappeared while being watched, whether it moved behind or in front of something, and instructions to draw a picture of the object and its movement.

Text extracted from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or wing trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
