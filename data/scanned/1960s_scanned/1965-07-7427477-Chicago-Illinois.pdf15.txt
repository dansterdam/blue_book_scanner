SUBJECT: The lady next door to us said she and her daughter saw this object at approximately 8:30 P.M.

DETAILS: From the information reported by XXXX and the manner in which she made her report, I definitely feel that she has observed something unusual in the sky on the date and time mentioned. She has observed the object for approximately 15 seconds and it was travelling from south to north very rapidly about the size of a small airplane at a high altitude.
