20 August 1963
Elko, Nevada

Statement on celestial movement sighted from this station:
This reporter, on 20 August 1963, while taking a pilot balloon ascent, observed through the theodolite an object moving from north to south. As the object was brighter than the pilot balloon, it caused the theodolite operator to cease tracking the balloon and track the brighter object.
The angular movement of the theodolite twice led to be sure of no fluctuation in the object's course.
The object was in sight from one to two minutes, although it could have been followed for a much longer time but for the balloon tracking.
The time was between 0403 and 0406 PST; elevation angle 25 to 35 degrees, azimuth 213 to 238, from Elko airport.
