The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire with various questions about the sighting of a UFO.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? No.
17. a. Sound: NOISE. b. Color: WHITE.
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? VERY LITTLE.
19. A sketch is provided showing a round object with the text "Round white in hole".
