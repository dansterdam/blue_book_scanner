The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram that appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The diagram shows a compass rose and instructions for the observer to indicate the location and path of the observed object on the diagram.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. No apparent motion.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving. N/A.
