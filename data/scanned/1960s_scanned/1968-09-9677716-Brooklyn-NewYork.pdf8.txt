There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page includes a list of "Did the Phenomenon" phenomena, a fill-in-the-blank response from the observer "My father", and two questions labeled "A. How did it finally disappear?" and "B. Did the phenomenon move behind or in front of something, like a cloud, tree, or building at any time?".
