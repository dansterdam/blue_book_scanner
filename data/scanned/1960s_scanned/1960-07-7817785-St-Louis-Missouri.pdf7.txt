The image appears to be a diagram or illustration from a UFO report document. It shows a hemispherical dome or sphere with various compass directions and angle markings around the edges. There is a small silhouette figure in the center of the image, indicating some kind of reference point or scale. However, the image does not contain any human faces, so I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.
