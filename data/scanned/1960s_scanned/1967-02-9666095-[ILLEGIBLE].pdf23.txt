EVALUATION

There is only one aircraft in the area bearing even the slightest resemblance to the craft reported. The past coast advertising Co.'s billboard advertising on Route 2A in Norwell, Mass., about 50 miles from this area.

Normally, I would have written this sighting off as a case of misidentification and evaluation as probably a helicopter or a jet, but there is enough about the sighting that does not correspond to conventional aircraft behavior to warrant giving a full report on this case.

1. The witness is familiar with aircraft. He works for Flying Tiger's, and as such, he regularly sees aircraft of all kinds. His impression was that whatever it was, it changed his mind. Whatever it was, it was not a conventional aircraft.

2. There was no noise, although the witness passed almost directly under the object's flight path with good visibility through clear, sunny windows closed. They make a rackety. 

3. The craft did not have conventional running lights.

4. The craft carried unusual and unconventional floodlight-type lights.

5. The craft hovered dangerously low over a main highway.

6. There was no sign of propulsion visible.
