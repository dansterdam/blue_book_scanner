Text from the document:

Dear Sir,
I had a night landing at our place at 9:45 Tuesday August 17, 1965. I saw a disc about 25 feet in diameter hovering about 3 feet off the ground. It has small lights around the edge and a large light in the center which pulsed on and off. I observed this for about two or three minutes and it then took off at a very high rate of speed and was out of sight in about 3 seconds.
I would appreciate any comments you may have regarding this incident.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
