This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads as follows:

UFO Observations
Mrs. Phyllis Spooner
Reference your recent letter regarding unidentified observations made by yourself and enclosed information. The information in your letter is too vague and general for evaluation. The sketches you enclosed were too small to be useful. We wish to assure you that your name will not be released without your permission. Thank you for reporting your observations.

ERIC T. de JONCKHEERE, Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Operations and Surveillance

COORDINATION: Major MAY

DATED: 22 June 1966
