Seattle, S.S. Washington
August 4, 1962
Dear Sirs:
The following report on the sighting of an unidentified object is submitted for your consideration.
On the evening of August 2, 1962, at approximately 8:00 p.m., two adults and three children observed a bright light in the sky over the Orcas Island area of the state of Washington. The object was approximately 100 yards in diameter and appeared to be rotating. The object was visible for several minutes and then disappeared. The object made no sound and was several hundred feet above the ground and were reportedly a triangle of some luminous bright objects moving very fast. They were all oval and were possibly a single object, but some seemed to fall out of formation. The object(s) were a couple of hundred feet in the air and were not moving in a straight line. The object(s) seemed to be a couple of hundred feet in diameter. This sighting was reported to me a short time after it occurred and I felt that it was an incident worthy of investigation. I would appreciate your consideration of this report and any information you could provide concerning the sighting.
Sincerely yours,
