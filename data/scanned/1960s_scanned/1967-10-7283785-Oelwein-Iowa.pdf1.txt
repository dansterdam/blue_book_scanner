11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer was photographing the moon when he noticed an object in the sky. The object appeared to be the size of the moon through the binoculars. Upon returning outside, the observer noticed the object was now about 30 degrees above the horizon and was moving in a Southwestern to Northeastern direction. The object was directional. When it was directly South of the observer, he noticed lights on the object resembling cabin lights on, or landing lights. At 1920 GMT at 42 deg 36' lat, the moon was at an azimuth of 230 deg 55' and at an altitude of 71 deg 23' at Oelwein, Iowa. During the first part of the sighting, the observed object may have been near the moon. When he returned outside, the object was at a different position.
