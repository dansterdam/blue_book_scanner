TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
AFTER MUCH PREPARATION, FILM DEVELOPING AND DISCUSSION WITH MY WIFE, I WISH TO REPORT THE FOLLOWING SIGHTING ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 24, 1965 AT APPROXIMATELY 0235 TO 0255 AT SUNSET RESORT, WEST HARBOR AREA, WASHINGTON ISLAND, DOOR COUNTY, WISCONSIN. WE WERE VACATIONING IN THE AREA.
AT THIS TIME AND PRIOR, I HAD BEEN OBSERVING THE HEAVY STAR COVER WITH 7 X 35 BINOCULARS, ALSO CHECKED A POSSIBLE SHOT OF SAME WITH A RICOH 35MM CAMERA WITH FLASH BY LAYING SAME ON GROUND, WIDE OPEN 30 FT. TO SECOND SETTING. I HOPED THAT I MIGHT CAPTURE IN SILHOUETTE SOME ADJACENT CEDAR TREES. (NO SLIDE) IS THE RESULT WITH STARS ONLY VISIBLE.
AT APPROXIMATE HOURS MENTIONED ABOVE I OBSERVED A BRIGHT ORANGE-CYLINDRICAL OBJECT IN THE DIRECTION OF GILLS ROCK TO THE SOUTHWEST. (SLIDE #19) PINPINTS THE AREA AT INTERSECTING ORANGE LINES. THE OBJECT WAS PROCEEDING IN A N-NW DIRECTION, AT APPROXIMATELY 10,000 (7) FEET. FROM THE 5 TO 10 SECONDS OR SO THAT I OBSERVED THIS UNTIL THE FOLLOWING OCCURRED IT APPEARED TO BE DECREASING IN SPEED. (NEAR STOP CONDITION) AT THIS TIME THE OBJECT (CLEARLY VISIBLE WITH NAKED EYE), SPEWED A POD OF FIVE OR SIX LESSER OBJECTS FROM THE FORWARD END, SIMULTANEOUSLY SCATTERING IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS, ONE OF WHICH ARCHED IN MY DIRECTION AND CAME STRAIGHT IN. NO EXHAUST WAS VISIBLE FROM ANY OF ABOVE AT ANY TIME. I LOST SIGHT OF MAIN OBJECT AS THIS WHITISH SMALLER OBJECT APPROACHED ME, TURNING TO BRIGHT ORANGE AS IT GOT CLOSER. THIS LESSER OBJECT CAME TO A NEAR STOP POSITION AND HOVERED OVER THE GREEN BAY AREA PINPOINTED BY INTERSECTING BLUE LINES ALSO ON (SLIDE #19).
