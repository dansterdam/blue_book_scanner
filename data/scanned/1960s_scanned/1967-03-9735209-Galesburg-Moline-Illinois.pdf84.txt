Transcription of the text in the document:

"Mentioned: (1) Sonce air traffic throughout the area is relatively heavy and ground traffic is virtually impossible because of the extended news coverage of previous similar sightings, it is recommended that the sighting be made by a group of reliable and responsible persons who can cooperate in making the observations and reporting the data. This group should be as large as possible but at least four or five persons are necessary, all of whom must be thoroughly reliable and familiar with observation and reporting techniques. 

Secondly, if any physical samples or traces of the objects should be found, these must be protected and preserved in a manner that will prevent contamination or alteration of the evidence. It must be noted that section 12 of the USAF Regulation 200-2 provides that such materials are to be turned over to the nearest Air Force base for laboratory examination and identification.

Furthermore, if it should be possible to obtain photographs of the objects, these should be made by a skilled photographer using the best available equipment and in a manner that will provide maximum detail and sharpness. The Air Force will reimburse the cost of such photography.

It is emphasized that all witnesses will be interviewed and their statements recorded in detail. They did see an object which could not be identified as any conventional aircraft or other known object. The investigator is to continue his investigation and report his findings to this office as soon as possible."
