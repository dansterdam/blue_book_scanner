AFR 80-17(CI)

THE ONLY THING TO INDICATE IT WAS A PHYSICAL THING AT ALL WAS A LITTLE OPENING OR DEPRESSION IN THE GRASS OF APPROX. 6 FT. DIA AND 2-3 INCHES DEEP WHERE IT APPEARED TO HAVE LANDED.

CONDITIONS: WEATHER REPORTING

DAY GENERAL SKY WEATHER  
CLEAR 2500 BROKEN LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE  
COOL TEMP.

REMARKS: THIS WAS THE SUN VISIBLE WHEN I FIRST SAW IT, AND IT APPEARED BRIIGHT AND CLEAR TO ME AND I AM CERTAIN IT WAS THE SUN AS YOU FACED.

HOWEVER, THERE WERE STRANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY THAT NIGHT THAT I AM UNABLE TO EXPLAIN. THESE LIGHTS WERE WHITE IN COLOR, MUCH BRIGHTER THAN STARS OR PLANETS. THEY APPEARED TO BE MOVING RAPIDLY BACK AND FORTH AND UP AND DOWN. THIS WENT ON FOR ABOUT 3-4 HOURS THAT NIGHT. AND IT SEEMED THAT THESE LIGHTS WERE CENTERED RIGHT OVER THE AREA WHERE THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WAS FOUND THE NEXT MORNING. I DID NOT SEE ANY OBJECT ITSELF AT THAT TIME.
WHAT I HAVE DESCRIBED HERE WAS TOLD TO ME BY THE FARMER WHO CALLED ME. HE SAID HE WATCHED THESE LIGHTS VERY CLOSELY THAT NIGHT AND WAS CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE NOT ORDINARY AIRCRAFT OR ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENA. HE SAID THEY WERE UNLIKE ANYTHING HE HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE. HE ALSO STATED THAT THESE LIGHTS APPEARED TO BE LOW OR DESCENDING TOWARDS THE AREA WHERE HE FOUND THE DEPRESSION IN THE GRASS THE NEXT MORNING.
