AF IN : 28780 (21 Apr 61)
BEING AN EXTREMELY HIGH FLYING TARGET. THE PERIODIC HIGH SPEEDS, AS HIGH AS 500 KNOTS, REPORTED FOR THE TARGET, COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT THE MTI OF THE FPS-8 WAS NOT OPERATING, FURTHER TENDS TO RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UFO BEING A VERY LOW FLYING TARGET. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR WHY THE FPS-8 HEIGHT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PAINT THE TARGET.
PART IV. CONTACT WITH LT/COL JAMES O. PAYNE, AFTEC, REVEALED THAT NO NAVY OPERATION COULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SIGHTING, AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIMILAR INCIDENTS DURING SUBSEQUENT TESTS.
PART V. IT IS CONCLUDED BY ATC THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED ON RADAR AT CAPE CANAVERAL ON 11 APR 61 AT 1437Z WAS PROBABLY A REAL TARGET, FLYING AT AN ALTITUDE OF NO MORE THAN 35,000 FEET. NO DEFINITE EXPLANATION OF WHY THIS TARGET DID NOT APPEAR ON THE FPS-8 CAN BE REACHED, BUT INSPECTION OF THE SITE AND THE RADAR MAINTENANCE RECORD WOULD REVEAL IF THIS WAS DUE TO A DEAD AREA OF FAULTY EQUIPMENT. THIS ORGANIZATION EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE CASE.
