Dear sir:
I would like to make a report may be of interest to the Defense Department. I am a resident of Girard, Ohio, in northeastern Ohio. 
Yesterday, July 17th, a brilliant object sppeared over my home as it have never seen before.
It was outstanding and moved at a terrific speed. I noticed its light apparantly from the northwest at about a 30-degree angle to the horizon. It could have been 1,000 feet or more against the dark sky. It moved a great distance in just a few seconds and then disappeared. I mentioned it to my wife, and she saw the same thing. It was absolutely silent. I heard no sound.
