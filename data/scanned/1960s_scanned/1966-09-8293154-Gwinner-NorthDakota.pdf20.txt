CASE RECORD FOR PROJECT BLUE BOOK
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting
DATE: September 8, 1966
LOCATION: Gwinner, North Dakota
WITNESS: Mr. Gwinner

On September 8, 1966, Mr. Gwinner reported sighting an unidentified flying object over Gwinner, North Dakota. The sighting occurred at approximately 8:15 PM.

Mr. Gwinner stated that he was outdoors at the time and observed a bright, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and emitted a faint glow. It remained stationary for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view.

Mr. Gwinner reported the incident to the local authorities, who in turn notified the Air Force's Project Blue Book, the official government program for investigating UFO sightings. An investigation was launched, but no conclusive explanation for the sighting was determined.

The case has been classified as "Unidentified" in the Project Blue Book archives.
