Question #3- Has this occurred again since two weeks ago?
Answer-Yes "Last night my wife and daughter both were outside. At approximately 7:00 P.M. the object appeared traveling west to east. As it receded the area overhead, they saw three pink objects expel 
from it. Both the object and the pink objects had a high rate of speed. The pink objects disappeared over the horizon. The original white object decreased to about 50 percent in size and suddenly disappeared."
In the interest of science and this country, I have forwarded this information to you. The first portion to see the object was Dr. Phoenix, Arizona. The other two people were his wife and daughter. Their phone number .
I trust that this information will be held confidential.
Dr. has agreed to be interviewed by any person wishing it. I would rather that my name were not mentioned even though Dr. knows that I am sending this letter.
I trust that I shall hear from you on this matter. I shall be quite interested in its outcome.

Very truly yours,
Mr. [redacted]
