The image contains three sketches:

1. A curved line sketch with the instructions "Imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it."

2. A larger sketch showing the position of the object when it was first seen and when it was last seen, with instructions to refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

3. A small sketch of a landscape showing the horizon line.
