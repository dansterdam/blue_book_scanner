The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram of a UFO. It is a black and white sketch showing the silhouette of a flying saucer-like object. The text at the bottom of the image states "You Have a Picture", suggesting that this is a page from a UFO report document where a witness has provided a sketch or drawing of an observed object.

The text in the document reads:

In case a picture is shown, it will show the shape of the phenomenon, include any data, and indicate exhaust or vapors, etc. indicate direction the phenomenon was moving.

What was the angular size or diameter, as estimated by the witness, as compared to a known object, such as the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length?  A simple sketch or drawing can be very helpful in understanding the report.
