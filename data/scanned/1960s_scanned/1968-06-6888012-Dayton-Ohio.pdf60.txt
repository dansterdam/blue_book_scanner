Note: The semi-quantitative spectrographic method used is intended to handle a very large variety of elements with approximate accuracy. These results are not, in general, suitable as a basis of major policy decisions, and where results are required for important purposes, definitive and more reliable analytical methods should be employed, either chemical or spectrographic.
