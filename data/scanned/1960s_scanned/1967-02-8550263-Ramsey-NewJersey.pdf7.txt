MAR 22 1967

Dear Joseph:

With reference to your March 14 letter regarding a report of a unidentified flying object (UFO) which was sighted over New Jersey on March 13, 1967, I have some additional information which I think you will find of interest.

Upon analysis of the aerial phenomenon or object which is unknown to us, this appears to be a valid sighting. This a report might be of assistance in preparing your science project.

Good luck.

Sincerely,

GEORGE E. FREEMAN, JR.
