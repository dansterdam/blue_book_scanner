Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object appears above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you lost sight of it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same compass when you lost sight of it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the subject or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and you can describe to show the direction they were traveling.
