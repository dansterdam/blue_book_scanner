Cincinnati Ohio

One night I decided not to look out of the window and I saw about eight flying saucers three went one way three went another way two went straight up one of the flying saucers who went straight up took off and the others followed to the ground. 

P.S. I feel that they came from somewhere over the hills that are near and I wish that I had watched them a little longer maybe I could have learned something more about them that we still don't know about UFOs right now I am sorry that I did not watch them longer they seemed to come from that direction and the only thing I know for sure is that they were there and I saw them.
