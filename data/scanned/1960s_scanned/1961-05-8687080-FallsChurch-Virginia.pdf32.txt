The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with rays or projections emanating from it, indicating the shape and height of an observed object. The second sketch shows a landscape with a person in the foreground and a smaller sketch of a similar curved shape in the sky.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" on the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" on its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
