Gentlemen: 

I would like to report the sighting of a U.F.O. at 9:00 P.M. tonight. The object was silver in color and was traveling at an estimated speed of 1,000 m.p.h.
It was traveling north of Tiffin from west to east. This is the second of these objects that I've seen this year. I hope that this will be of some help to your research.

Sincerely,
