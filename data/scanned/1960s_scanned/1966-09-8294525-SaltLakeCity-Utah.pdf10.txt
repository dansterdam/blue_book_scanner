17. Tell in a few words the following things about the objects:
a. Sound
b. Color ORANGE FLASHING TAIL

18. We will try to make an estimate of the object's size. About how much space would the object have taken up in the sky, compared to the size of a known object like the head of a kitchen match, if the object were that far away? If you had performed this experiment during the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing the object that you saw such as lines, proportions, etc., and especially about trails or lights. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
