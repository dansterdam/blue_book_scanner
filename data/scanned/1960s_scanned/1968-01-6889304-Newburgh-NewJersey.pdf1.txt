11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers sighted a red object which was about as bright as the sun and hovered occasionally. The object seemed to stop at times, hover, and then move on. It also appeared to change directions at times. Just before the object disappeared the observer sighted a red streak from the object. This object after a short interval disappeared widely. 
Comments: The wind was blowing toward the SW and the object moved roughly south. The description is consistent for Hot Air Balloon, especially the tried streak before the object disappeared.
