Born sight
of unusual life for report on 4/27/67 witness - a farmer who re- ported something unusual in the sky at about 9:00 - 9:15 p.m. on April 27, 1967. The witness stated that he was working outside his home, and looked up into the sky and saw a bright light moving very rapidly across the sky. The light suddenly stopped and hovered motionless for a few moments, then jumped rapidly to the right at an angle and then continued on its original path and disappeared. The witness estimated the light was approximately 1000 feet high and was moving at a high rate of speed. The light was described as a "ball of fire"and about the size of a basketball.

The witness stated that he called his wife to come out and see the object but by the time she came out it had disappeared. The witness said that he had never seen anything like it before and that it was not an aircraft, satellite or any other known object. He said it was traveling too fast and made too sharp a turn to be an aircraft. The witness was quite upset and shaken by what he saw.
