PENNSYLVANIA PILOT CHASES UFO: An interesting article dated August 13th tells of a western pilot who was flying from Kennedy International Airport when he spotted what he described as a "strange object" he was chasing. The object was said to be travelling "straight toward the object". He was within about five miles of the object when he lost sight of it. The object then suddenly disappeared from sight. Hoffman told newsmen that he was unable to close the gap between his plane and the object, which was a cut of sight within a matter of seconds. Hoffman is the owner and operator of the Shamokln Flying Service. At Shamokln, Pa.: He has been flying since 1934, and is known to be a stable and reliable person.
