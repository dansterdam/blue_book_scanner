The stranger in the photograph
Without necessarily suggesting that the stranger identified in this photograph is not what he appears to be, there are certain facts that should be noted:
According to the description given by the witness from the London Daily Mail, he first saw the "stranger" at the railway station and saw him again with two young children, a son and a daughter, as he was getting into his car. The witness states that the "stranger" was the driver of the car. In front of the witness was the photographer's daughter, who was photographing the "stranger" and the two children as they got into the car. The witness states that the "stranger" appeared to be very disturbed by this and tried to get the photographer's daughter to stop taking the photographs. The witness states that there was definitely nothing unusual about the "stranger's" appearance and that he was dressed in a normal manner.
The witness states that he then followed the car and saw it drive off. The witness further states that he took no other action, such as questioning the "stranger" or the children, because he did not wish to create any unpleasantness. The witness felt that there was nothing unusual or suspicious about the "stranger" and the children, and that his actions were probably entirely reasonable.
The police have been informed of this incident and are investigating. They wish to interview the witness and obtain the photographs, if they are available. The police feel that the photographs may provide some additional information that could be of value in their investigation.
