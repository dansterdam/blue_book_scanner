The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this particular image.

Here is the text I was able to extract from the document:

DEAR MR. SECRETARY:

Enclosed is a copy of a letter addressed to me by Mr. Robert Friend and concerning an unidentified object sighted by Mr. Edward E. Strong, of Fresno, California, concerning which he and his family say they had a strange encounter last evening at the hours mentioned.

As the Air Force is responsible for the investigation of UFO's, I would appreciate your looking into this matter and letting me know what your investigation discloses.
