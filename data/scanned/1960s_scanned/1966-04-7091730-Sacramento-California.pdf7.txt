Dear Mrs. 

Reference your letter 35-22 August 1966 regarding your unidentified object sighting made at about 8:15 p.m. on 30 April 1966. We are unable to offer a conclusive explanation. Venus could have been observed along with the UFO, since it was sighted about 0.75 hours after sunset and your comparison of size and brightness is consistent with this explanation. However, we are unable to confirm or deny that Venus should have been observed along with the UFO, since it was being categorized as unidentified.

I regret our inability to provide a conclusive explanation. I wish to thank you for your time and your consideration. 

Sincerely,

VICTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
