0130 29 Sept 65
Call received from
Major Allan F. Livers
Senior Director on Duty
Detroit Air Defense Sector (NORAD)
Battle Creek, Michigan

He explained that a meteor sitting occurred on the 29th day of Sept, and
that a man,

Harold Karnes
1/2 29th Street
Reno, Pennsylvania 677-5235 (Code 814 through Oil City)

and his wife had been painting a house when the object dropped near them.
It frightened them, and they left the scene, returning later to find
an object roughly the size and shape of a child's football. It is
apparently hollow with rubbery walls approximately 1/16 inch thick.
It was cracked, but all pieces were recovered. This is near Oil City,
Pennsylvania.
Mr Karnes reported this to the:
652 Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron, Oakdale, Pennsylvania
and they are waiting to pick up this object for delivery to FTD if this
is desired. They are going to wait for a call from FTD.

MEMO FOR RECORD:
On 7 October Major Quintanilla went TDY to Pennsylvania and obtained the object
from Mr Karnes. Object was a found of some sort, not a meteor.
