Dear Sgt:
Thank you for your letter of 10 May. Your classmate's obser-vation is interesting and will be evaluated with the information which you have given us. Since we have not received any reports of this incident as a consequence, the elevation, size, duration, etc., if your classmate's information is his observation to the Air Force, he may do so by completing the attached PID Form 86.
I am sending you some information which might be useful in compiling your report.

Sincerely,
