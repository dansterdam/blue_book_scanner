After we were about two miles away from the light, it seemed to be flashing, rather than rotating, and getting higher and higher, finally disappearing from view. This light seemed unusually large and bright in comparison to normal aircraft lights. The color was orange or amber, and the flashing was not regular, but variable in rate. I also noticed that it cast a beam of light downward for a considerable distance from itself. The size and shape of the light at this time resembled a searchlight. The light seemed to be suspended from the sky, not attached to anything, and the area around it appeared to have a somewhat hazy or fog like appearance. After it disappeared, no other lights were visible in the area. The direction it took was generally towards the north west and it was visible for around 4 to 5 minutes before going out of sight."
