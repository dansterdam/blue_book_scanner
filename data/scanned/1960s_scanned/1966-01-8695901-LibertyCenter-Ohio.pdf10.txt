There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text.

The text in the document reads:

"The probable location of a space vehicle or aircraft has been determined to be near the aircraft and the grass field by the owner of the field and occupant of the house. The space vehicle or aircraft was not visible and left no mark on the ground. There were no sound effects nor visible action observed by the witness. 

Even upon close examination no evidence of residue or scrap could be found.
