The image does not contain any photograph. This appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

On the top of the page, it says "AFT PO-17(CD)".

The section titled "THE PHENOMENON" lists several characteristics or observations about the UFO sighting, including "MOVE IS A STRAIGHT LINE", "SPEED SEEMED UNUSUALLY FAST", "BREAK-UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE", "CHANGES BRIGHTNESS", "DISAPPEARS AND REAPPEARS", "DISBLUE & CAST", "FLUTTER OR WOBBLE", and "DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?".

The handwritten note at the bottom of the page says "How away".
