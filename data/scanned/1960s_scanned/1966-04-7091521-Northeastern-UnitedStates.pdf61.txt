SPRINGFIELD, MASS.
George Gambiino, a cameraman for Station WWLP-TV, was returning from an assignment when he spotted a brilliant light streaking between the buildings of downtown Springfield and shot these pictures. First evidence of the meteor looked like a fiery sphere with a twisted tail a few seconds later (right) it appeared to flicker and disintegrate into beams of light. Springfield, like New York City, lies east of the meteor's path, hence the meteor seemed to move left to right across the heavens.
