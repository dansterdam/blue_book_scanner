Text extracted from the document:

Dear Sir,

On July 25, 1963 at about 10:20 P.M. I observed an unusual aircraft maneuvering in the sky. It was flying at a relatively low altitude and appeared to be silent. The craft was approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter and had a glowing blue-white light. It seemed to be hovering or motionless for a period, then would suddenly dart or dash horizontally at a very high rate of speed. After some minutes of observation, the craft suddenly disappeared from view. I was somewhat puzzled by the nature of this observation and would appreciate any information you may be able to provide. I would be happy to discuss this further if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
