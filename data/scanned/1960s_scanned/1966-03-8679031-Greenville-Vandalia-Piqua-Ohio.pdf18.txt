INSISTS IT WAS THERE

Officer's Film
Shows No UFO

Film shot by a highway patrolman who said he saw an unidentified flying object hovering over Wright-Patterson Air Force base early Sunday was developed yesterday and "was blank ... nothing but a blank," the Air Force and Highway Patrol officials agreed.

The Air Force and Highway Patrol officials agreed that the object probably was the planet Venus. Officials of the Air Force's Blue Book, the office that investigates UFOs, said Venus was extremely bright over Dayton early Sunday.

BUT PVT. Richard Landwehr, the patrolman who took the film, insisted "it's there" and the Air Force "just didn't get the film that shows it."

Another report from Edon, Ohio, tentatively identified as an airplane, but investigators were checking that a report.

Meantime, investigators at WPAFB got at least four reports of sightings last night that they identified as earth satellites.
