There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with a blank space in the center. As an OCR system, I can produce the following text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
Day 	Month 	Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
