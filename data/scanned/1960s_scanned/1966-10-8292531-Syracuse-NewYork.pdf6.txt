DATE OF SIGHTING: October 26, 1966
TIME OF SIGHTING: 9:30 P.M. Eastern Standard Time

I was in the back yard of my home, located at the above address, photographing the moon using an Exa with a Wirgar f=13.5 lens set at infinity with an opening of 4.5 at 1/50 a pair of 7 X 50 binoculars. Turning away from the moon, I had already exposed the central I saw a brilliant, silvery light approaching slowly from the east approximately 20Â° above the horizon. The brightness of the light was comparable to that of a mobile headlight at a distance of 75' when set on high beam. The light did not appear to stand still at any time, after its sudden appearance, did not up or explode, leave a visible trail, change shape or it approached the zenith, the light lost its silvery brilliance and became milky white but did not lose its brilliance.
