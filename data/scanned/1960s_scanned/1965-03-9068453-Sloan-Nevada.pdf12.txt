P NRS 1. Prints of UFO Frame
PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order 65-107 from Major Quintanilla Jr. (TDEW/UfO) to analyze one photo taken near Sloan, Nevada on 20 March 1965. The following analysis was performed by the Photographic Interpretation Division (DPT)(Photo Processing).
ANALYSIS: The print shows rocky ground with a large hill on the right side. The sky appears to have a large oval-shaped image. A dome appears on top of the oval. The complete image has a slight trail.
CONCLUSION: No further processing from the negative is possible. The photo is about as good as it can be. There is no detail or marking of any kind visible on the object that could help in identifying it. This type shutter would not smear an image. This image appears to be a genuine object. Any distortions that may be seen could be caused by a drop or developer on the emulsion, then wiped off.
