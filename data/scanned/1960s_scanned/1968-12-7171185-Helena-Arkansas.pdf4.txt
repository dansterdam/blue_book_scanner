The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Details ARE DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS:
I AM NOT REALLY SURE OF THE DATE OF THE SIGHTING, BUT I REPORTED THE SIGHTING SOON AFTER IT WAS OVER, AND THE TERROR I EXPERIENCED WITH THIS QUESTIONING IS STILL VIVID. 
NEIGHBORS AND I TO LOOK AT THIS CRAFT. ONE OF THE NEIGHBOR'S CHILDREN SAID HE HAD SEEN IT BEFORE HIS MOTHER WOULD NOT COME OUTSIDE TO LOOK. APPROXIMATELY 60 SECONDS, I CALLED A FRIEND, WHO WORKS AT THE ARKANSAS POWER AND LIGHT STATION ABOUT 30 MILES BELOW HELENA. THEY HAD SEEN NOTHING. THIS IS WHERE I THOUGHT THE UFO MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN EASILY, AND THEY ARE ALWAYS OUT ON THE STRUCTURE.
SEEING THE AIRPLANE AND BEING A PILOT MYSELF, I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE MEMPHIS FLIGHT SERVICE STATION TO SEE IF THEY COULD BE MADE WITH THE PLANE. IF THEY REFUSED TO HILLBROOK ABOUT HIS STATION, THEY RETURNED ME TO WITTINGTON ABOUT A POSSIBLE ERROR.
I ANSWERED A QUESTIONNAIRE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO THIS EFFECT, I REALIZE THESE STATEMENTS TO BE ALMOST TRUE.
