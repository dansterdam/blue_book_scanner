Spoke with Major Hale, 3 August 1966, 0745 hours. Airplane is going off in approximately ¾ hour from Youngstown, arriving in Dayton, approximately 1¼ hours later. 2335* is the plane number. Wanted us to call base to have them notified that they were departing off some information packages and will be right off again. Recommended bringing a station wagon to pick up the cast and soil samples.

Two guys from AFFK descended the plane over the beach Monday night. They took a picture, about five seconds, as some light, with a movie camera. They are sending this film into us. With all the background information on it.

Sand samples in tubes are marked one, Y and other E. This stands for areas where the sighting took place. One is from West section other East section.  

Conversation with Capt Keller, 3 August 1966, 1445 hours. He has rewritten statement from all witnesses. There is no description on all of these. The length, size etc. There doesn't seem to be any concrete. If you talk to them you see that they definitely have seen something. He disarms of "so called space craft which they described as real. Witnesses described it as a five sided figure, with lights around it, in the middle. Observed from 300-400 yards away. He had talked to the graphic who took the pictures of the landing site. Everything is going to build onto everything. 32 year old calm. She didn't see it land, only saw something in the sky like a satellite. Thought it was a satellite. Noise was similar to a jet motor. Girls saw nothing except a glow through the woods. Glow of course.
