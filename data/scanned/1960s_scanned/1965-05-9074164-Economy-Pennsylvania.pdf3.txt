Reference the attached letter from ___ requesting information on identified flying objects and submitting a photograph as provided in order that a reply may be made:

a. The present head of Project Blue Book is Major H Quintanilla, Jr.

b. The incident referred to in Frank Scully's book, "Behind Flying Saucers" is not based on fact. The Air Force had no corroboration with this alleged incident. The Air Force regards this book as fiction.

c. The fact sheet forwarded to Mr ___ in January 1965 contained the conclusions of Project Blue Book to date.

d. We have no other reports from the Pennsylvania area on 27 May 1965. At this late date specific identification of vehicles depicted would be extremely difficult. The characteristics of this sighting indicate that an aircraft moving at high speed, providing inadequate visual observation time, could account for the phenomena.
