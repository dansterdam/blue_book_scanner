Sighting of 21 March 1966 - Dayton, Ohio
Received call from [redacted] Dayton, 45410 on 23 March 1966.

Thought it was very unusual, like a searchlight, like glowing star, like an airplane, glowed bigger and brighter than a star, moving faster than a satellite, was real bright, lot brighter than Venus, at approximately 10 pm, saw it right away, wasn't like a weather balloon, decided it wasn't an airplane, silvery light. Observed at Smithville and Linden, Dayton, Ohio. Saw it for a couple of minutes, when her husband saw a space ship he would report it then and only then but he didn't want her (Mrs. [redacted]) reporting any light. Mrs. [redacted] didn't want any harassment. Informed her we didn't release names to newspapers, etc. She said she would fill out a form 1612. Form sent on 29 Mar 66.
