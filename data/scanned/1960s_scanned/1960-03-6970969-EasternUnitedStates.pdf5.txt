The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten letter or document from Little Silver, N.J. dated March 19, 1960. The text in the document is as follows:

Gentleman:

This is for the purpose of getting the attention of a scientist who is interested in the cause of unidentified flying objects. In the evening of March 9, 1960 at 8:20 P.M. my wife and I observed a silver gray colored object moving in the sky at an altitude of about 1,500 to 2,000 feet. It was triangular in shape, approximately 20'-18' in size. It was moving at a high rate of speed in a straight line from the east toward the west. There was no sound emitted from the object. As it was passing overhead, it appeared to be spinning or rotating very rapidly on its own axis. The object disappeared in the western sky.

The only equipment we possess that might be of interest to G.I. Trainor would be a tape recorder and copy paper. On the tape you will find a recording of the voices of my wife and myself discussing the object immediately after the sighting. We do not claim to be experts on this subject but would be pleased to cooperate in any way that might assist in the investigation of this phenomenon.
