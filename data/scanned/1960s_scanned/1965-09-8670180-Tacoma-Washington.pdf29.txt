Dear Mom and Dad,

I hope this letter finds you both well. The reason I'm writing is because I had a strange experience the other night which I would like to tell you about. This may have been partially the result of something I saw here or heard about.

On September 25, 1965, around 10:00 p.m., I was out in my back yard and I noticed a strange object in the sky. At first I thought it might have been a satellite or an airplane, but as I watched it, I saw that it was definitely not either of these. The object was round and had flashing lights on it, like the kind you see on airport control towers. At times it appeared to be standing still, and then it would suddenly dart off at a tremendous rate of speed. 

I watched this display for about 45 minutes until it finally disappeared from view. I was really quite shaken by the experience and wondered what in the world I had seen. When I came back in the house, I turned on the TV and saw that there had been a news report about some similar sightings in the local area. Apparently, a number of people had called the police to report seeing strange objects in the sky.

I don't know what to make of all this. I suppose it could have been some kind of experimental aircraft, but the way it moved was very unlike anything I've ever seen before. I'll be sure to let you know if I happen to see anything else unusual. In the meantime, I'd be very interested to hear if you've ever had any experiences like this.

Love,
Your son
