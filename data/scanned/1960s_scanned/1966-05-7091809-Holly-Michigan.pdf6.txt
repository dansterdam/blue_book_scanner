May 7, 1966 at 9:40 p.m. I spotted an object high in the sky. It appeared to be a falling star. Not just a point of light, but rather it had substance to it. As I watched, the object began descending at the same angle and speed of a falling star. The object was moving so fast that it took about 3 or 4 seconds to disappear from view. It caused no noise or sound. The entire sighting lasted about 3 minutes. Because it was coming down at an angle and when it disappeared, it had that characteristic of a falling star.
