The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter dated October 3, 1962, addressed to "Dear Mr. ______", and signed by W. J. Lookadoo, Public Information Division, Office of Information.

The text of the letter is as follows:

The Air Force is primarily interested in the "immediate threat" potential of an unidentified aerial phenomenon, correspondingly, relative to the national security of the United States. Beyond this potential and in the line things that 
may be potentially interested in from other scientific interests would be the additional scientific values that might be derived from an in-depth investigation.

May I suggest that you contact Mount Wilson or Palomar Observatories in the Los Angeles area for a possible correlation of facts on meteor listings.

Sincerely,

W. J. LOOKADOO 
M. Colonel, USAF
