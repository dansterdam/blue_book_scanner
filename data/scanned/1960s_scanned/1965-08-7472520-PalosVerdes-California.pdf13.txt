The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The document contains a form with questions about an observed UFO, including whether the object disappeared, moved behind something, or moved in front of something. The witness is asked to describe the sound, color, and angular size of the object. There is also a prompt to draw a picture showing the shape of the object and the direction it was moving.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? A CIRCULAR OBJECT AND IT BECAME LESS DISTINCT OR FADED OUT.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) YES (No) Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) (YES) NO Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what: 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound A LOW HUMMING SOUND
b. Color SILVERY OR METALLIC

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

THE WHOLE OBJECT

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you may such as wings, projections, etc., and especially indicate trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A simple drawing of a circular object is included.]
