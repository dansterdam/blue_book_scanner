Hector (Guanajuato) Meey
I saw this
On the night of October 9, 1948 between 6:30 and 7:00 PM. At our residence in Haight village, Petersburg, Michigan, my husband and I saw a strange flying object in the sky. It was globular or spherical in shape and looked to be about 30 feet in diameter. It was maneuvering and gliding along silently and swiftly. While watching it, it suddenly seemed to dematerialize from our sight. It was not an airplane, helicopter or any other known aircraft. The object appeared to be under intelligent control and was definitely not a natural phenomenon such as a meteor or planet. Most of the persons in our neighborhood besides myself and my husband were witnesses to this strange occurrence. I did try to get a closer look, but as I approached it, it would seem to move away from me. It was a very strange and unexplainable experience. I do know that I am not the only one who has been watching for or seen this type of UFO in this area. Apparently, others in this region have also been observing similar objects at various times. I would be most interested in any information your organization may have regarding this particular sighting or others that may have been reported in this general area. Please let me know if you require any further details from me.
