Dear Sir:

Recently, two unidentified flying objects have come to my attention particularly because this area seems to be one of the more active in the country. Their appearance has been frequently reported in newspapers across the country.

The first sighting was on the night of September 16(or possibly the 15, but one of those two days) at 7:00 or 8:00 in the evening(it is not certain). Something was observed in the sky which may or may not have been a star. I thought it was a star larger than I noticed it was moving toward the horizon. It seemed to take about 15 minutes to disappear about 35 toward the horizon where it disappeared. A red narrow object or objects could be seen at times drifting slowly about. This object or objects which followed with it as it coursed toward the northeast horizon where it finally was obscure and disappeared.

The second incident was last Monday, October 4, 1965. At approximately 7:20p.m. my husband and I were driving and observed a white object. It traveled in a straight line (part of a great circle around the earth).

To sum up some obvious conclusions and state some conjectures:
