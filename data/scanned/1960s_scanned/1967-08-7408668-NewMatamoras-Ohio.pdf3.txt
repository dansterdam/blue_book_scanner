The shared image does not contain a photograph. It is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

THE LIGHTS WERE QUITE ERRATIC IN THEIR MOVEMENT.
THERE WAS NO SOUND, AS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE HAD
THEY BEEN AIRCRAFT. THE SPEED OF THE OBJECTS SEEMED
VERY HIGH. I COMPARED IT TO OTHER PLANES IN THAT
AREA, AND IT WAS DEFINITELY FASTER THAN ANYTHING
I HAD EVER SEEN.  THESE OBJECTS MADE NO SOUND AT ALL. IT WAS QUITE A SIGHT THAT SEEMED WOULD HAVE TRAVELLED
AT HIGH SPEED.
