Bright Objects in Sky

An unidentified flying object (UFO) was reported seen in the sky near here yesterday evening according to a telephone report received at the Nevada Highway Patrol offices. The highway patrol, in turn, notified the air force.

The New Mexico UFO sightings continue as residents at Carlsbad and Artesia report seeing bright, round objects maneuvering in the sky, one of which was said to have come down near the ground a few miles northeast of Carlsbad.

A Del City resident reported seeing a strange object light up the sky, hover, then streak away at a high rate of speed. As it went it seemed to change colors.

The highway patrol reported that persons living in an area west of Roswell saw the UFO and called the patrol. Officers investigated but were unable to substantiate the report. The sighting was about 11:30 p.m. Two daughters and a son, all of whom live in the area, watched the objects for about five minutes, the patrol said.
