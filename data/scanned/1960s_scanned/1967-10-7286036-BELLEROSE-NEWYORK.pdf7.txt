Exhibit to question over (name) observation, made on or about 3:25 p.m., Oct. 5, 1967 at Bellerose, New York by (name). I was standing outside my home located at (address) observing the weather, as it had been very windy for the past few days. At that time, I observed an object in the sky which appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed, much faster than any jet aircraft that I have seen. The object was shaped like a disc or saucer and was silver or metallic in color. After watching it for about 3 to 4 seconds, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. I have had the opportunity to observe many aircraft and the like in the sky, but I have never seen anything like this object before. I shall report it as an unidentified flying object.
