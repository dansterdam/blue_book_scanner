The image contains two photographs. The first photograph shows a cloud formation with some irregularities or breaks in its structure. The second photograph shows a similar cloud formation with some additional markings or annotations on it.

The text appears to be a technical report on the observations and measurements of these cloud formations, likely in the context of a Project Blue Book investigation. The report discusses the height, structure, and movement of these "noctiluaent clouds" observed on 2 November 1963.

Low-Latitude Noctiluoent Cloud of 2 November 1963

1. The observed phenomena:
On 2 November 1963 a noctiluent cloud was observed at Knoxville, Tennessee at approximately 18:15 GMT. This observation confirms the existence of these unusual clouds appearing in the southern night sky.

On 15 June 1963 a noctiluent cloud was observed at Wheeler, Alabama at 0400 GMT. Ground observation indicated an origin from the northeast. Analysis of this observation disclosed a more accurate measurement of the cloud depth and height as compared to other available measurements. The results of this analysis are used to study the height of these unusual clouds.

The total extent of the observed cloud as shown in Fig. 1 was approximately 15 degrees in height and about 50 degrees in length. The western edge of the cloud seems darker and more sharply defined, while the eastern edge fades gradually into the night sky. This appearance seems to indicate that the cloud is moving toward the southeast.

Measurements of the points along the cloud indicate that the main part of the cloud is about 112 km high and that the tips of the cloud extend to about 98 km in height. The time of observation was about 15 minutes after sunset, the cloud being illuminated by the sun's rays passing through the atmosphere at a very low angle.

Fig. 2. The photograph shows a closer view of the cloud, indicating that the cloud is linear and branched upward toward the southeast.

While the measurements of relative height seem fairly conclusive, the absolute measurement of the heights are subject to rather appreciable errors. This is due to the uncertainty in the precise location of the cloud areas within the 3-per cent atmosphere refractive layer. The cloud edges shown in Fig. 1 are not sharply defined, and their location along the line of sight is not precisely known. As a consequence we must be cautious in interpreting the absolute heights. However, the relative heights measured appear to be fairly reliable.
