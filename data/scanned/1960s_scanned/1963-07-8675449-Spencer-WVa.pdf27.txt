The image does not contain a photograph. It is a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

The text found in the document is as follows:

"No Case (Information Only)

JULY 17, 1963 English

Dear Sirs,
Enclosed is a photostat of a clipping I received from an English newspaper. It seems that "good looking UFO" is seen in the sky by some people. I think it is worth looking into as the thing seems to be linked with a UFO. If so, here is more tangible evidence which your group denies to exist.

Sincerely,
Wenham, Mass.
