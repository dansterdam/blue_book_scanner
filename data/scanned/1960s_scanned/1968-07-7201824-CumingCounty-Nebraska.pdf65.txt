The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) between 1947 and 1969.

The text in the document is as follows:

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AND NOTES
Seems intelligent, doesn't want to say anything and gave no report, only said "Well, I saw a light in the sky. That's about all." States came close enough for details. Unable to say how far the object was, how high or in what direction it was moving, just that he saw it. Says he is quite familiar with aircraft and this was not any type he ever saw before. Reported that object moved suddenly away without any noise that could be heard and disappeared. Asked if aircraft were in the area at the time and said he didn't know of any. Stated that he was outside doing some work when he saw the object and he watched it for about 5 minutes.
