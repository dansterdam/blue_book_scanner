NO CASE: Information Only SIGHTING REPORT DAVID R . EWING NOV-DEC 65 6 AUG 63 Ambleside, England

Next came two or three persons, said to be "in space suits," who got out of the craft and proceeded to inspect it and then go back in again. This incident took place at about 2200 hours on July 28 in the Lake District itself. This area is very well known and is a popular tourist resort. The night in question was described as being a fine summer's night with a full moon, and the observers claim that the craft was in view for some twenty minutes. It gave off a "shimmering light" and was about 50-60 feet in size. They reported that the craft appeared to land and then take off again, and the observers stated that they were greatly disturbed by the incident. We have the observers' written statements, and they seem perfectly reliable and responsible people. They have given a very detailed account of this incident, but as the case concerns reports of space-suited figures, we have been unable to obtain any photographs or other corroborative evidence. A full report has been forwarded to the Ministry of Aviation, and the DEFE records show that they have received a similar report from the observers.
