Briefly, this was another UFO phenomenon, the time of arrival was about 3:15 A.M., There were two circles of lights, the diameter of the outer circle was 3 to 4 feet when it first appeared and about 3 inches when it left. There was a steady, bright, orangey-red light in the center. The lights were plainly visible and lit up the whole area so that I could see the scenery as in daylight. The lights were motionless for an instant, then began moving slowly across the sky, rapidly accelerating as they moved, going in a south-east direction. They were gone in a few seconds. I was shocked, that this thing happened right over me, it was so close, at an estimated altitude of about 100 feet. At the time it was in full view, there was not a cloud in the sky, and the stars were very light - so light in fact that one could read a newspaper by that light alone. It looked about twice the size of a large star, and appeared to be just above the trees. This was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any conventional craft. It had no sound, no wings, and was shaped like a globe or two saucers facing each other. There was no indication that the lights were separate vehicles-they appeared as a single unit. This occurred on a north-south highway in a very open, flat area. There are no lights or buildings for miles in any direction, so I am certain it was not a reflection or any earthly source.
