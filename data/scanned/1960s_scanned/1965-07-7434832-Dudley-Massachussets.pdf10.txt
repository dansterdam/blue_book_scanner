My wife and I were sitting outside waiting for a thunderstorm to pass. It was about 8:45 PM and we both noticed a bright light moving in the sky from the East to the West. It was a light like we had never seen before, and it seemed to be of a pulsating or oscillating nature, that is, it would vary in intensity from time to time. The light appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed and was at an elevation of about 45 to 55 degrees above the horizon. We watched this light for approximately 2 to 3 minutes as it crossed the sky and then disappeared. It did not seem to be an aircraft, nor did it have the characteristics of a meteor. The light was of a yellowish-white color and was much brighter than any star or planet. If this was an aircraft, it was traveling at a very high rate of speed and the illumination was of a type we have never observed before on any aircraft. We are at a loss to explain what we actually saw that night, but we are both convinced that it was not an ordinary aircraft or astronomical phenomenon.
