There does not appear to be any photograph or image in this document. The image shows a typed text that appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report or document. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

THAT ANY OF THE UFO REPORTS EXAMINED IN THE STUDIES REPRESENTED TECHNICAL
DEVELOPMENTS OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF PRESENT DAY SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE. THIS
WAS IN 1955, AND SINCE THAT TIME, PROJECT BLUE BOOK HAS CONCERNED ITSELF
WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE SIGHTINGS, EVALUATION OF THE DATA, AND RELEASE
OF THE INFORMATION TO THE NEWS MEDIA. THIS INFORMATION IS GIVEN TO THE
PUBLIC IN THE FORM OF NEWS RELEASES AND BLUE BOOK BROCHURES.
TODAY, THE OPERATIONAL PORTION OF THE PROJECT IS STILL LOCATED AT
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT IS STILL
THE SAME TODAY AS IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING, AND THAT IS TO DETERMINE IF
UFO'S PRESENT A THREAT TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES.
I WOULD EMPHASIZE AT THIS POINT THAT, ALTHOUGH WE GO TO GREAT LENGTHS
TO COLLECT ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON A SIGHTING AND TO REACH A CONCLUSION
AS TO WHAT STIMULUS CAUSED THE SIGHTING, SUCH AN EXPLANATION IS WHOLLY
SUBORDINATED TO THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF BLUE BOOK -- THE DETERMINATION IN
EACH CASE WHETHER THERE IS A THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.
