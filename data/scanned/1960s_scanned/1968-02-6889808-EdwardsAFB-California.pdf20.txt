The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with a space for drawing a picture that would show the shape of the phenomenon, and a question asking about the angular size that could be held at arm's length in front of a known object.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT. SUCH AS A COIN OR PENCIL. HOW MANY TIMES LARGER OR SMALLER WAS THE HEAD OF THE PHENOMENON. IF YOU WERE ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE MATCH HEAD THE PHENOMENON COULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY.
