35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

We were looking at the heavens, observing the northly star on a clear night, and were attracted to this boy and were watching the object that appeared to us. It was a brilliant object; brighter than the brightest planet and larger than the largest meteor we have ever seen. The object first appeared to be very high in the sky and then seemed to drop and move towards the horizon, becoming smaller in size as it moved away from us. It then took on the appearance of an airplane traveling thru the sky, but seemed to be moving more rapidly than an airplane. After watching it for several minutes, the object suddenly disappeared from view. The entire time we had the object under observation, there was not a cloud in the sky. The night was very clear and the object was brightly illuminated. We have no idea of the origin of the object. It was unlike anything we have ever seen before.
