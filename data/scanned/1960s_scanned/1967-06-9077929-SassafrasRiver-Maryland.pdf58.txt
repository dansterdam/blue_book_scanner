WE WERE NOT FOR A VISIT WALK IN THE AREA AT THE EVENING. ALL THIS IS VERY QUIET. THEY WERE ON THE OPPOSITE BANK OF THE RIVER HERE: 2 BEAUTIFUL CRAFT SHAPED  SPARKS FELL AROUND THE 2 POWER POLES. AT FIRST I'D THINK  I'D SOMEONE BENDING OFF FENCEPOST FIREWORKS FORCENTLY FALL, BUT WHEN I'D WATCHED I SEEN THERE WERE NO POWER THROUGH THOSE WIRES OR STARS PASSING THAT WAY WHEN FINALLY THEY WENT OUT. THE SPARKS FELL AROUND THE POLES ABOUT 2 FEET HIGH AND LAST 3 OR 4 SECONDS EACH TIME.
