Dear Mr. _________,
Reference your recent unidentified observation and subsequent slides of numerous unidentified objects.
Examination of the slides revealed the images on frames 32, 40, and 41 were very similar and consistent of a round, circular object with a bright center spot and surrounded by a brighter zone that the remainder. On frame 37, the object assisted of a circular light-centered image with a small darker image in its center.
Frame 31 contained your images and a void between the first and second images of sufficient size to accommodate a possible third image, though in a turn.
Although no positive explanation of the images has been determined, the description is consistent with that of some types of aircraft engaged in aerial advertising. The photographs appear such a probability.
Enclosed are the five color slides which were submitted for analysis. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. We appreciate your cooperation.
Sincerely,
