The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn illustration and diagrams related to a UFO sighting report. The illustration depicts a curved sky with a compass-like dial, and the text below the image provides instructions for the viewer to imagine and draw sketches related to the UFO sighting.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky-line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show its position when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
