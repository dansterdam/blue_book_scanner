32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve 
that the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the 
sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline).

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw 
it. Refer to a smaller sketch to compare the size and position when you first saw it.
