Nov-Dec 65
Bernardo de Irigoyen (Province of Misiones)
La Razon (Buenos Aires) for June 9, 1963, carried a report from Rosario stating that General Raul Castillon Perlarin, commander of the National Gendarmerie (Gendarmeria in the North-East), recently gave a press conference at which, inevitably, the great UFO wave of the summer of 1963. In this connection, Commander Zirone told the newspapermen of an interesting earlier sighting - in 1963. He said that on July 27, 1963, when he was commanding the Gendarmerie detachment at Bernardo de Irigoyen, he and the Chief of Police, Commandante Jose Cacicio, and the Deputy-Chief, Senor Luzia, had seen even oval luminous UFOs, flying in a West-East course in the direction of Brazil. The objects, moving at great speed and altitude, gave off many-coloured flashes of light, and as they passed beneath the cloud cover they lit up the clouds with their varied colours. The authorities at Eldorado, 170 kilometres distant, later reported that the formation had passed over there. The paper quotes this as being one of the rare occasions on which a high officer of the Argentine National Force has spoken openly about the UFOs, and notes that what had impressed Commander Zirone most of all was this extraordinary display of colours.

To conclude this part of the Argentina 1963/64 story, here is one of the most suggestive cases of the period, one which has become a "UFO classic".
