The image contains a photograph showing two sketches related to UFO sightings and reporting. The upper sketch is a compass rose with directional markings, likely intended to be used for indicating the direction of a UFO sighting. The lower sketches depict two scenes - one showing a person standing in a landscape with mountains in the background, and the other showing a person standing in a landscape with hills or mountains in the background. These sketches appear to be intended for documenting the position and orientation of a UFO sighting.

4A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE OBJECT WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE OBJECT WHEN LAST SEEN.
7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON FOR OBSERVED FLIGHT PATH. EXAMPLE: IF THE PHENOMENON FLEW FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, PLACE THE "A" ON THE LEFT AND THE "B" ON THE RIGHT AND CONNECT THEM WITH A LINE.
