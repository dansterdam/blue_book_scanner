Dear Sir:

I enclose a letter to the John F. Kennedy Space Center about a 30 inch object that I saw. It was about 1 to 3 in size, and I was asleep in my bed when I saw it rise off the ground and fly away. It made a slight noise from a fan, and was going straight up at first but then went off into the distance. It was as large as a large classroom chair.

Could you send me some information leading to where I could pursue this further, and as some of your own friends agree, please as I have done, look into this case.
