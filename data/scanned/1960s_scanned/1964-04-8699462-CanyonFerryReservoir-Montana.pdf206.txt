"changed my way of thinking," said Mr. Gitens."
"The Defense Ministry spokesman said we have had no reports of any unidentified flying object being seen in the Croydon area, and we have asked the police to investigate any such reports."
Croydon again
Croydon was in the news once more. A report from the Croydon Advertiser on April 17 carried the headline "Woman sees strange object in sky."
"When Mrs. May Church looked out of the front window of her flat in Far Tree Gardens, Shirley, on Sunday night, she stared at another unidentified flying object converging with the W. P., as Mr. Church saw a large, dull, glowing object moving slowly across the sky. Her husband, Alfred, and some friends who were there at the time also watched it."
"The Defense Ministry spokesman said we have no knowledge of any unidentified objects being seen. And as far as I know, there are no expected artificial satellites flying over this area tonight."
"According to the report, the object was first sighted between 8.40 p.m. and 9.10 p.m. on Sunday night (April 12), and it was watched for over 20 minutes. It looked like a star moving across the sky, but it was definitely not a balloon or an aircraft. It was too large to be a plane, and it gave no indication that it was an aircraft, said Mr. Church."
"A group of people, including the Methodist minister, the Reverend J. W. Parsons, were also reported to have been watching the object on Sunday night."
"It looked like a star, but it was much larger than a star and was glowing," said Mr. Church. "It was like a star that had changed into something else. And it was moving across the sky as though it was a balloon, but it wasn't a balloon. It was definitely something unusual."
