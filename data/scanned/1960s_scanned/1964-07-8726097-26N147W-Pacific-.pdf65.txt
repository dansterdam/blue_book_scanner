Unidentified Flying Object With Bad Smell Reported

TOCCOA, Ga. (UPI) - The pilot of a Piper 28 by R.B. Welden said he and his passenger noticed a mysterious object around this area, emitting a "terrible odor" as it passed their plane.

Welden said the object was about 20 feet in diameter and appeared to be metallic. He said it passed his plane at an estimated speed of 400 to 500 miles per hour.

The next Tuesday night, while Patty Griffin and a group of neighborhood children were playing outside, they noticed the same or a similar object over their home. They said it gave off a bad smell, rocked back and forth, then shot up into the sky.
