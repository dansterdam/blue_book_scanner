I noticed the object about 6:10 p.m. Sunday evening, October 25, 1964 at Deford, Michigan. I was driving north on highway M-46 about 1/2 mile north of Deford when I noticed a bright light in the sky to the southeast. The object appeared to be moving in a northerly direction at a moderate speed. It was a bright light, larger than a star, and appeared to be emitting a glow. I slowed down my car to get a better look at the object as it passed overhead traveling in a northerly direction. I watched the object for approximately 30 seconds as it passed out of sight to the north. I did not notice any sound or unusual features other than the bright light and the northerly direction of travel. I have no explanation for what this object was.
