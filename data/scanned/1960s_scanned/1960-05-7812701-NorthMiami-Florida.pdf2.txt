The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: was the same as a star. No outlining was visible and it seemed to be at such a brightness that it might be a star. However, the light never varied in size or brilliance unlike stars. The light, however, was steady and about the size of stars near it and appeared to be red in color.

OTHER DETAILS: On one occasion the object was spotted for approximately 4 to 5 seconds. It then disappeared from view as though it had turned off or flew away. On another occasion it was observed for around 10 to 15 minutes. During this sighting no sound was heard, however due to the great altitude, I doubt we could have heard any sound even if there had been any.

THE NIGHT WAS A CLEAR AND BRIGHT ONE; my daughter and I both enjoyed excellent visibility. NEITHER THE DAUGHTER NOR I COULD DETECT ANY MOTION OR CHANGE IN POSITION OF THE OBJECT DURING THE OBSERVATION. It appeared to be stationary, but its location was slightly changed when next observed.

I would appreciate this statement being kept confidential and trust your discretion in this matter. I have held a responsible position in local civil defense for the past ten years as controller and business manager and consider myself to be a thoroughly reliable person.

LOCATION - Keystone Point; North Miami, Florida.

SWORN TO AND SUBSCRIBED TO BEFORE ME A NOTARY PUBLIC, STATE OF FLORIDA, AT LARGE, ON THIS 15TH DAY OF JUNE, 1970.
