NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
11 JULY 1961
SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA

CALIFORNIA NEWSMAN ATTACHED TO A GROUP AND SAID HE SAW A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. HE WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY IT AND SAID IT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE. IT MOVED AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND HE SAID THAT HE HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. HE WAS QUITE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL TYPE OF AIRCRAFT. HE SAID THE OBJECT WAS BRIGHT SILVER IN COLOR AND GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING VERY HIGH IN THE AIR. THERE WERE NO LIGHTS SHOWING AND HE FELT IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT AN AIRCRAFT.
