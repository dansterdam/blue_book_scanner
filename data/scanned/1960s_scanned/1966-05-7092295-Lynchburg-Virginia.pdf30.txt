Proposed reply to letter from [redacted], 13 December 1966

Dear [redacted],
This is in reply to your letter of 13 December 1966 in which you report an unidentified observation. The United States Air Force does not investigate sightings outside the continental limits of the U.S. Therefore, we filed your sighting for information purposes.
Enclosed is a brochure on Project Blue Book which describes the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects.

Thank you for your interest in our program.

[Signature]
