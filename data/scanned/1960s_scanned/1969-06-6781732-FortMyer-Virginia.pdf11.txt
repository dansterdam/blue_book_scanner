There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document that contains a form with handwritten responses.

Transcribed text from the document:

DID YOU OBSERVE THE PHENOMENON THROUGH ANY OF THE FOLLOWING: INCLUDE INFORMATION ON MODEL, TYPE FILTER, BINOCULAR, ETC.

BINOCULAR:
WINDSHIELD:
SIDE WINDOW OF VEHICLE: 
UNAIDED EYE:

DID YOU ORDINARILY WEAR GLASSES? YES [ ]  NO [X]
DO YOU USE READING GLASSES? YES [ ]  NO [X]
IF ANSWER TO 3a IS YES AND THERE IS A QUESTION OF THE DISTANCE OF THE PHENOMENON, GIVE ESTIMATE OF SPEED. 

IN ORDER THAT WE MAY OBTAIN AS CLEAR A PICTURE AS POSSIBLE, GIVE IN YOUR OWN WORDS A COMMON OBJECT OR OBJECTS WHICH, WHEN PLACED IN THE SKY SIMILAR TO WHERE YOU NOTED THE PHENOMENON, COULD BE SEEN BY AN AVERAGE PERSON UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS.

AS WE HAVE NOTED, SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE WITNESSES' DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PHENOMENON GIVE ESTIMATE OF DISTANCE.
