Dear Sir:
I am writing you the details of an unusual sighting of an unidentified flying object which occurred here in Providence, Rhode Island on 12 Aug 1965. The object was first sighted by employees of the US Signal Corps office at about 10:10 PM EST. The object was described as a bright light which appeared to hover over the city for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. A number of the employees witnessed the object and notified local civil defense and police authorities. Several police officers also observed the object and confirmed the sighting. I would appreciate your investigation of this incident and your comments on the possible nature of the object. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me.
Sincerely,
