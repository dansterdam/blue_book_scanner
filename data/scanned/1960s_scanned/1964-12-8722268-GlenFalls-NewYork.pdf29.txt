Green Light Shoots Over Omaha Area
Two Deputies, W.E. Employ Sight It
By Hub Ogden
Early this morning, around 1 a.m., two Sarpy County Sheriffs deputies on patrol northwest of Omaha saw a green light shoot across the Omaha sky early Friday morning.
W.E. Employ, and a Western Electric employee, Joe Golden, reported to Sarpy County Sheriff's office they saw the rare phenomena while on patrol about 2 miles south of Rainwood. Employ is a deputy sheriff on the southwest edge of Omaha. 
The light was described as a bright greenish-blue streak that raced to the southeast at high speed. It lasted but a few seconds. 
"I knew there would be a lot of phone calls about it," said Employ. "This is not the first time I've seen something like this."
The light was in the shape of an elongated tear-drop. The largest forward part was a brilliant, brilliant greenish-blue. It slowed somewhat toward the trailing end and did not light up the terrain.
It moved in front of them on a horizontal path.
