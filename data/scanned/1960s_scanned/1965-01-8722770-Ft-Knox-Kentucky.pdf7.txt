NON-SCHEDULED NEWSLETTER #22
March 10th, 1955

We recently had a report from someone claiming to have had a photograph of several "circular discs" taken earlier. However, the photographer has not yet located the negatives or prints. As soon as he does and they have been developed, we will notify you. No color photograph, as was mentioned in the report, has been received at this time.

Please be assured that as soon as this illustration or any other photographs of value come into our possession, we will have them reproduced and included in a subsequent issue or supplement.
