The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch is a compass rose indicating the directions. The smaller sketches appear to show the perspective or view of the phenomenon when it was first seen and when it was last seen.

Now imagine you are an optical character recognition (OCR) system. The text found in the document is:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE. THIS SCHEMATICALLY SHOWS WHETHER OR NOT MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON OCCURRED FROM THE FIRST SIGHTING TO THE LAST SIGHTING OF THE OBJECT.
