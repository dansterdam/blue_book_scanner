The image contains two illustrations.

The larger illustration is a compass rose with directional labels. This appears to be a diagram intended to help observers indicate the direction and movement of a UFO sighting.

The smaller illustrations below the compass rose appear to show perspective drawings or sketches of a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon. The left sketch depicts a person standing in the foreground with an expansive landscape in the background. The right sketch shows a close-up view of a rocky or mountainous landscape.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 'Y' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A 'Y' AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE 'X' AND 'Y' WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. NORMALLY DRAW SKETCHES TO SCALE. THIS IS SCIENTIFICALLY DONE WITHOUT
SCALE FOR CONVENIENCE OF ILLUSTRATION. FOR EXAMPLE, OF HOW TO COMPLETE
THE LARGER SKETCH.
