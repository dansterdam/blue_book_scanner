Text output from the document:

It was siting
on an illuminated airport on the surface of the ground when it took off giving of a brief white glow as it left a round cylindrical object about 30-40 feet in diameter. The sound it made was more of a buzzing or pinging noise than a roar. As the object was departing I attempted to get a better look at it but it disappeared beyond my view with a burst of speed that I was unable to estimate.

I was watching the object about 1 or 1.5 miles distant and was located on an overlook where I had a good view of the area. There was little activity is this area at the time and my attention was drawn by the unusual nature of the object. The weather was clear and the sky was dark with very few clouds so I had a good view of the activity. I waited about 10 or 15 minutes but saw no further activity.

I immediately reported the incident to the local State Police and Air Police but am unaware of any further investigation or confirmation of the object. This is a rather isolated area and although I am quite familiar with the normal aircraft activity in the vicinity this object was unlike any I have ever seen before or since. I would be glad to provide any additional information that you may need.
