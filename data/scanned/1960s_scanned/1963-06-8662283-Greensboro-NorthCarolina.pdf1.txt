8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Extremely bright meteorite flashed from the northern horizon. Then disappeared. Thought to be a missile or aircraft running light of c/g, but believed to be at extreme altitude. Altitude difficult but estimated 80-100,000 ft. Extremely bright white light, but lacked uniformity and had sudden lateral movements. Jerky motion, erratic movements. Went over horizon too fast to watch further.
