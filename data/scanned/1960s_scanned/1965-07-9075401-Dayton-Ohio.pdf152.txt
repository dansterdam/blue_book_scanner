"Would indicate a rather complicated situation resulting from several objects 
from other parts of the sky not associated with the reported objects. This 
appears to be a not uncommon occurrence and the investigating unit appears to 
have done a commendable job in attempting to unravel the various aspects of the 
sighting as described. The details provided do not permit positive identification 
of the reported objects, but the possibilities considered appear reasonable."
