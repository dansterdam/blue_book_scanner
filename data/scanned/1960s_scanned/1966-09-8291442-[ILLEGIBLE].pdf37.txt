Transcription of the text:

"Just something he's going over in the air. I told the man I could not in good conscience attempt to analyze this report as presented. It was very vague about 1st 50 seconds but have since received more details that indicate the object was quite large and hovered and then shot away at a rapid rate. Probably the closest to what the witnesses described. The sighting was miles away and was apparently quite difficult to determine distances by the witness. He seemed puzzled and said it was real difficult to judge how far away and how large it was as well as the speed. He was sufficiently impressed that he thought it was not a conventional aircraft. The case crew remain to be convinced."
