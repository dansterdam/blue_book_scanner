MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Observation and landing, 20 Sep 67, Tipp City, Ohio
Lt Marano spoke with the Sheriff of Miami County. He asked the Sheriff whether they had UFO sighting for last night the 20th of September. He said that the only one they had was from Englewood where two boys had seen a flying saucer. A deputy went down to the area and couldn't find anything. Deputy Adkins had taken the report. The Sheriff said he would send Lt Marano a copy of their report. They reported going North on 25-A when the flying saucer hovered over them until they went to the intersection of route 571 and 25-A. The object was large rectangular when it came down, a white glaring light blinded them.
Lt Marano spoke with Mr. Shumaker of the Dayton Tower. He had an aircraft at 1118 or 1119 pm 20 Sep a DC-9 approach did come slightly East of Tipp City. The DC-9 came from the North making its approach slightly East of Tipp City. An American 727 came from the South and made its approach slightly East of Tipp City at approximately 1129-1130 pm. A Twin Otter DNOG left Vandalia at 1126 pm going NW then North. Probably would have been between 1200 and 3000 ft alt, slightly West of Tipp City. The other planes would have been at about 1200 ft altitude. They all had red beacons rotating, one on top and one on bottom. The outbound planes would have had condenser chargers on wing tips. The approaching planes would probably have had their landing lights already on or would have turned them on as approaching Tipp City. The twin Otter would not have had his landing light normally on, however, if there were other aircraft in the area he may have flashed his lights. None of these aircraft reporting siting sighting anything unusual. If they would have it would have been in the report log.
