INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
A typical example, Figure 31 shows some of the formulas that you find in use in sheet metals. You see the constants that you normally have in some of them change to variables in the new formulas. They change the material that we can use accordingly. 

STRESS-STRAIN EQUATIONS
ISOTROPIC (METAL SHEET, FILM, FOIL, etc.)
ϵx = 1/E (σx - μσy)
ϵy = 1/E (σy - μσx)
γxy = τxy/G

ORTHOTROPIC (FABRICS)
ϵx = 1/Ex (σx - μxySy)
ϵy = 1/Ey (σy - μyxσx)
γxy = τxy/Gxy
