Text from the document:

January 3, 1967

Lt. Colonel George P. Freeman, Jr.,

Dear Sir,

Supplementing my December 27th letter on the varhead sighted by me over Paris, recently. In September 1965, when I think may have happened, a missile firing from a submarine but before it hit the target, it dropped off and disintegrated, producing the effect seen in the skies and lights.

I do hope that our naval base in Cuba is equipped with a seismograph, so as to be informed thoroughly about any missile firings from that area.

SINCERELY,
