The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document reporting a UFO sighting that occurred near Grangeville, Idaho on May 11, 1964.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Grangeville, Idaho residents watched an oblong-shaped object which appeared to hover near the Cottonwood Air Force Radar Installation on the nights of May 10-11, 1964 from 9:30 to 11:15 p.m. Sheriff James Puzell and others watched the object through binoculars as it moved "back and forth" on a horizontal plane. Colonel Luis Zandriel, Station Commander, at the Radar station, said several of his men reported sighting a bright object. "I don't know and neither do they. We are buffaloed. I have forwarded our report to higher headquarters," he told newsmen.

The object was in the north from Grangeville and appeared to disappear on the radar, blinking out a star as an explanation. The object made no noise, appeared on two consecutive nights at the same time and was not seen again.
