The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text and a sketch or drawing of an unidentified flying object (UFO) at the top of the page.

The text in the document is as follows:

"They are Believing that they are not alone in this world. The problem today is that they do not know who or what these craft are. They must try to learn more about them before they try to make contact with them. The craft one sees and one hears reports about are really more advanced than anything we have, so let us try to learn more about them before we try to make contact with them."
