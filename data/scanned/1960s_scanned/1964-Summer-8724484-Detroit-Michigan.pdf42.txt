THE TEXT FOUND IN THE DOCUMENT IS:

on the river bend, a person-
shaped object, about 3 feet tall, white
in color, floated by. The witness observed
this for about 30 seconds before it went
out of sight behind some shrubbery.
The witness descried the object as having
a well-defined outline or profile. It did not
move in a straight line but rather floated in
a "meandering" fashion over the water. It
appeared to be motionless and did not seem
to be supported by any visible "means of
propulsion".

The witness said that last evening,
about 9:30 pm, she was fishing on a small
bridge over a river when she observed what
appeared to be a person-shaped object,
about 3 feet tall and white in color, floated
by on the river bend. The object had a well-
defined outline or profile and it did not move
in a straight line but rather floated in a
"meandering" fashion over the water. It 
appeared to be motionless and did not seem
to be supported by any visible "means of
propulsion". The witness observed this for
about 30 seconds before it went out of sight
behind some shrubbery.
