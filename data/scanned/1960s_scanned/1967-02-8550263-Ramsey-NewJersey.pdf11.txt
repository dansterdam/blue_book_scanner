DEAR MR. X:

I regret the delay in answering your correspondence; however, our present backlog has precluded an earlier reply.

Investigation revealed that you probably saw the star Capella; however, without additional evidence, we are unable to identify positively what you observed. The description you submitted is consistent with that of a bright star that has sometimes been described as appearing unusual due to atmospheric conditions. Capella has (also) been known to cause such misidentifications.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force; your interest is appreciated.

Sincerely,

BARRETT D. YOUNG
