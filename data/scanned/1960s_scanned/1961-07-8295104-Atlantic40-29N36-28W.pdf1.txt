11. COMMENTS
Object observed at a distance, moving erratically, hazy at times, appeared to be quite large and very bright. It was not possible to ascertain the exact nature of the object due to the distance. It could have been a balloon, but the movements were not consistent with those of a balloon. No sound was heard and no other phenomena were observed in connection with this sighting.
