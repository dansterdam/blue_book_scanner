Dear Sirs:

I would like to report the sighting of a U.F.O. on the morning of July 6th. It is similar to a report of about 2 years ago from Bridge City, Texas. We saw the same thing and I don't know if I should make this report. The object was strange and the same as the one I saw about 2 years ago. It was orange in color and was about 270 yards from us for about 7 minutes.

I would appreciate if you would look into this matter with such sights [sights].

Respectfully, yours
