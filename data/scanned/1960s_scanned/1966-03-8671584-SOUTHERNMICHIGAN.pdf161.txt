REPORT ON THE DEXTER-HILLSDALE, MICHIGAN UFO SIGHTINGS OF 20 - 21 MARCH 1966

In my capacity as scientific consultant to the Air Force on UFOs, I was requested to investigate two major sightings in Michigan which, for some reason, had captured public attention and were the subject of many radio and news stories. It was unfortunate that I did not ask permission to take at least two assistants along. Mr. *** of the Dearborn Observatory asked to go along, as had Mr. *** and Mr. ***. A far better job of interviewing the large number of ostensible witnesses to the same events could have been done.

Once upon the scenes (Dexter and Hillsdale - and Ann Arbor and Chelsea along with Dexter), despite the help of AZC Banby (loaned from Selfridge Field) I realized that the task was far too great for one man if all the witnesses wishing to be interviewed (and many of whom were 'miffed' because I had either not had a chance to talk with them or was able to give only a short time to them) were to be satisfied. Since I had no authority to call in help without going through PTD, and that would take time, I decided upon the following plan of action: I would limit myself to interrogating key witnesses in both localities and would use as the basis of my judgment only those 'information bits' that were agreed upon by several witnesses. I could not give weight to one person who contradicted some bit of information which the others had already concurred in.
