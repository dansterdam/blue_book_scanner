The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned copy of a typed document from the United States Air Force Project Blue Book, which was a program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

SUBJECT: STARS Clippings on UFOs

TO: DA -CTR (CAPT. J.L. QUINTANILLA)
3705 AEROSPACE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER

1. Reference telephone conversations on 26 Jun 64 between Capt. Roady.
HQ and SSgt. Michaud, 466 ASCS.

2. Enclosed are copies of the newspaper clippings on articles about Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOS) in the Southeastern Georgia area.

3. These are usually separate from the UFO reports out of Anderson, S.C. as they are mainly of sightings of lights in the sky and reported to the Law Enforcement Agencies. However, they are unconfirmed and are not investigated by the ATIC. Personally, I would submit them for further action. It was further agreed that no written report would be submitted for routine.
