The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which was a former U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page appears to be a form or report, with various sections for the observer to fill out details about the observed object, such as the weather conditions, time of day, direction of movement, and other relevant details.
