Sighting Background:
On 15 October 1969 I received a telephone call from Assistant Chairman
Francis Gogulski who stated that Investigator Charles Valentine was
conducting an investigation of a 16 October 1969 UFO sighting made by
M. 'name redacted', an Indianapolis Superior of Digital Equipment COP.
I received a letter (attached) and a signed questionnaire (attached)
from Charles Valentine on 18 October 1969. The following report is based upon this
data.

The Charles Valentine Letter:

"10-16-69

"Subject: Attached report on UFO sighting - J. LARKIN.

"My: "I'm not sure I would call to you all of the details to any case this part of interview
with J. LARKIN, However, it's not sure that the recorded in any certain."

"'I was snooping around about 4 years and would rate him as a 'interested-in-ons believer in UFO's.'"

"Informant said I got the impression he felt it was a solid object."

"He said he saw (2 or 3 times) a 'bright speck or streak' of light jump' for the rear of the subject when it was scheduled.'"

"His vision is very good and he is generally skeptical in his overall attitude toward extra-terrestrial craft/beings etc.

Cordially,
Charles Valentine"
