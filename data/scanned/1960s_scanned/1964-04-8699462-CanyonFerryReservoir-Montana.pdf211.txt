Screaming
Object Digs 
Hole in Yard

BATON ROUGE, La., Apr. 7 - (UPI) - An object fell screaming from the sky into a residential back yard last night, digging a four-foot-deep crater in the earth.

There were reports of four other objects falling in cultivating areas.

Dr. Raymond Grenchik, professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University, said the objects could have been pieces of a meteorite.

FLOYD L. MARALON said one of the objects plunged through a large tree in his back yard, creating a crater about 13 inches wide and four feet deep. He said the object broke branches as it went and dug a crater about that depth.

Police dug down six feet in Maralon's yard. They found the hole at that depth, but nothing else.
