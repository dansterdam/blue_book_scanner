Reference your unclassified message, BC OO-25, 5 March 1967, subject "Report of UFO Sighting: The initial report from your office with the forms completed by the observers, several consulting and investigating individuals, became available. Before considering any action, the following additional information is requested:

1. The watch of the two objects was observed for several minutes and subsequent observation was also visually for several minutes.

2. Did the radar operator actually observe any of the objects, both, or visually only? If there were two objects, did both appear on radar? 

3. At the object for two minutes, yet a completed FAI Form 14 indicates their observation only for less than two minutes.

4. There was no indication whether tower personnel were contacted; and it missing observe the objects. If none, why?

Your report also indicates that Sergeants Vaughn and Hanson heard a sound similar to a jet engine. However, the completed form indicates that the observer, Sgt Vaughan, did not hear any sound. Request this discrepancy be clarified.
