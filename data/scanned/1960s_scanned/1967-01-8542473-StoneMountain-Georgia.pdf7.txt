The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with a series of questions and instructions.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? It says, "No."

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? The respondent circled "Yes" and wrote "It seem to".

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? The respondent circled "No".

17. a. The sound of the object is described as "None".
b. The color of the object is described as "A white light".

18. The instructions ask the respondent to hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and estimate how much of the object would have been covered by the match head. The respondent did not provide an answer to this.

19. There is an instruction to draw a sketch that will show the shape of the object or details, and include an arrow to show the direction the object was moving. The respondent has drawn a horizontal line with a circle in the middle, but no additional details or labels.
