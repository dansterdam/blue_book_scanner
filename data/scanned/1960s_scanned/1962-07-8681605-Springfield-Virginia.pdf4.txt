The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet, likely a part of Project Blue Book, which was a program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

A strange object passing overhead, moving at an extremely rapid rate, turning sharply at one point, changing color from white to red, then out of sight. This was seen at night from my backyard. The object was in sight for only a few seconds and seemed to be at a fairly high altitude. A sight that I was quite startled by and one which I can't fully explain.
