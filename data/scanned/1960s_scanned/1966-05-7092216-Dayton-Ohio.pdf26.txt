Dear Mr. 

Refer to your recent conversation with the Duty Officer at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio regarding your unidentified observation. The Duty Officer's report enclosed that you wished to be contacted by telephone. This office has attempted to reach you after 1530 hours on 18 May 1966; however, we have not been successful.

If you are enclosing a PTD Form 164 for your completion, do you have any questions regarding this matter? We do not have enough information to make a definite evaluation of your observation.

I wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
