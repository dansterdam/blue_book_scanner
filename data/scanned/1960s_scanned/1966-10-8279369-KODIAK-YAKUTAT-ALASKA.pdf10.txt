UFO Report (ALNT Msg. 55304, 10 Oct 66)

TO: AFSC (FTD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. This office received a call on 10 October 1966, from Mr. [redacted], who sighted an unknown object at 10/1635Z, 10 miles south of Yakutat, Alaska (5930N/13945W). He was unable to determine size of altitude because of the long distance between himself and the object; but he did say it appeared to be a balloon.

2. We feel this may have been the same object as sighted at Kodiak Naval Air Station, Kodiak Island, Alaska, 10/0615Z, and reported in the referenced message. The size and altitude of the object at Kodiak Island is also listed as undetermined because of the long distance between the observers and the object; but it was reported that a free floating object at the altitude reported from Kodiak would have reached the vicinity of Yakutat at this time.

3. The original drawings and personal comments from observers at Kodiak are attached.
