Dear Sirs:

On August 9th at approximately 9:30 P.M. I was sitting on my patio in Hollywood Hills with my wife, my son, and my step-son and a friend. We were looking through my binoculars at the moon and the stars. Suddenly we noticed a strange object crossing the sky. It seemed to be moving at a tremendous speed.

I looked at it with my field glasses and yellow "there goes a falling star". However, it was not a falling star, as it did not disappear but got closer and closer to the horizon. It then crossed the horizon at a tremendous speed.

I watched it through the telescope for approximately 2 minutes. It looked just like a satellite, but could be directed at will. I have always been a skeptic with regard to UFOs, however, if this was not a satellite, it certainly was a UFO.

There were many airplanes in the sky above Los Angeles this night and you can be assured that this was not an airplane.

Yours truly,
