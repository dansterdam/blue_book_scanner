On the night of July 19, 1965, two cities near Vandalia, Ohio reported seeing an object in the sky. The object was described as being circular in shape, silvery in color, and much larger than a normal aircraft. It was observed hovering over the area for about 20-30 minutes before it suddenly took off at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. Several witnesses in the area reported seeing the object and their descriptions of it were very similar. No other information on this incident was provided.
