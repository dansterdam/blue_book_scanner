AIRFORCE CASE NO. 63-8539

OXFORD COUNTY, MAINE
6 SEPTEMBER 1963

The witness, Mr. William Knox, reported that at approximately 7:55 PM, he and his wife were driving towards South Paris, Maine on Route 26 when they observed a brilliant, bluish-white light in the sky. The light appeared to be about 5 miles distant and at an estimated altitude of 1,000 feet. 

The light was described as being approximately the size of a golf ball held at arm's length and was seen for about 30 seconds before it abruptly disappeared. No sound was associated with the observation.

Investigator's comments: This sighting is typical of those which have been reported in the past, i.e., a bright light in the sky observed for a short period of time and then disappearing. The witness appears to be reliable and there is no indication of any other explanation for the sighting.
