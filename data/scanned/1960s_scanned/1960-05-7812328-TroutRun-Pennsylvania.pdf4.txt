The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and an object above the horizon. The instructions ask the viewer to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was when it was first seen, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when it was last seen.

The second sketch contains two separate images. The larger image shows a road with buildings and hills in the background, and an individual standing on the road. The smaller image shows a more distant landscape with a silhouetted hill in the background.
