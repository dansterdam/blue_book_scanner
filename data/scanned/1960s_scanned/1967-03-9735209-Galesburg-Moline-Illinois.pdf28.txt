Text from the document:

CAPT HAZO: Now Office - was there any lights or any colored objects hanging on to, or protruding from the car, or identifying it as anything else that I could find?

MR: There were no lights. I didn't see any objects protruding from the car, or anything else that I could identify it as.

CAPT HAZO: Now when you saw it illuminated, or against a tree, as you said, could you give us an estimate in comparison to the tree as to the height in comparison to the tree?

MR: My ability to adjust, or to estimate height, is not real well. But it seemed higher than the lights in the car, but not that much. In other words, what's the height of a Piper Cub has to fly over our city?

CAPT HAZO: This is understood... What they have to fly?

MR: Have to.

CAPT HAZO: I believe it's a thousand feet or twenty-five hundred or something like that. One question - did this object make any sound whatsoever? Was there any sound?

MR: No. I heard no sound. I believe I left my motorcycle engine idling. The other lady there heard a hissing or whirring sound. I never heard no sound.

CAPT HAZO: Okay, thank you very much.
