PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 5/7/1930 - 2200
2. LOCATION: Virginia Beach, Virginia
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-visual
7. W-E then N-S
8. WEATHER: Clear
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: Possible AIRCRAFT
COMMENTS: The observer sighted a craft that was shaped like a broom with colored panels that changed to olive green. At 1930 local, the object was traveling from W to E and was about 3-400 ft high. At 2200 hrs, the observer sighted the object again at about 100 ft high. No one else reported seeing any such craft despite the long duration and low altitude. It also seems that the observer sighted it twice while no one else seems to have seen it. Also the conclusion of "Possible AIRCRAFT" seems to indicate that the observer did not take pictures but apparently did not try to call anyone else's attention to the object. It is felt that if the observer did see something, it could have been an aircraft.
