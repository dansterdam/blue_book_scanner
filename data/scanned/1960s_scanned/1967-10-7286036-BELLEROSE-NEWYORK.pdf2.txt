The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the transcribed text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It was like the object just disappeared and then reappeared again a little farther away. It seemed to move just like a light bulb going out and then coming back on again.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: It seemed to move behind a cloud and then reappear.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of: It moved behind a cloud and then reappeared in front of the cloud.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Silent
b. Color: At first it was a bright light and then it seemed to change to a dim red or orange color.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
No to of the full size.
It was with the loss.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[The image contains a simple hand-drawn sketch of the UFO sighting, with an arrow indicating the direction of movement.]

NOTE: SOMETIME BETWEEN 2:15 AND 3:50 AM.
