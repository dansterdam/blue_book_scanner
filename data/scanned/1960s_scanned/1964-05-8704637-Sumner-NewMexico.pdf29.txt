OHIO POLICEMEN REPORT UFO

Mentor, Ohio
3 May 1964

Mentor, Ohio - May 3 - A bright UFO reportedly seen over Lake Erie from Mentor - witnessed by John D. Hadden, Lake County deputy sheriff, and Manager of Mentor Police, who, fearing ridicule, declined to give their names.

They first saw the object in the east, descending slowly. It was round, disc-shaped and glowed with a soft light. All of a sudden, it started to expand or come nearer in its approach, and, after about one minute, once again diminished to its former size.

The UFO then shot away southward at an extremely high velocity. The object zoomed behind the tree tops and then emerged into the clear, descending a curving path which ended abruptly in less than 10 seconds.

The object was described by Hadden as circular, a yellowish white in color, with a soft glow.

A woman near Painesville, a town near Mentor, reportedly observed the object in the sky thereafter. Patrolman Don Janz visited the object in its southward flight from Mentor. On The Lake, the craft was judged to be similar in size to an 11" object held edge to edge at arm's length.
