No Case (Information Only)
30 Oct '61
Derby, Pennsylvania

Lt. M. Derry, 34, of four apparently definite encounters (sightings) with unconventional aerial vehicles were reported by Capt. R. F. Barry, Jr., USAF, at the request of Headquartera USAF Office of Information Services. As required by current regulations, the incident was described as follows:

On the evening of 30 October, Lt. Derry was driving along a highway in the Derby area. At about 11:30 p.m. he spotted an object in the sky that appeared to be approaching. He stopped his car and watched as the object came closer. It appeared to be triangular in shape and was surrounded by a bluish-white glow which increased in intensity as the object neared. When the object reached a point about half a mile away, it suddenly accelerated at a terrific rate of speed and disappeared from sight within a few seconds. Lt. Derry jumped into his car and pursued the object, but the intense speed of the vehicle made it impossible to keep the object in sight, and it finally disappeared behind some trees. Lt. Derry reported that the glow increasing in intensity and the extremely rapid acceleration of the object were most impressive.
