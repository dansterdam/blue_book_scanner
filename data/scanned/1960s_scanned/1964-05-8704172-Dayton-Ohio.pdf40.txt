Mr. called at 2250, 16 May 1964. He stated that he had heard a report on a local radio station about lights in the sky. He seemed to think that the Air Force would not take them seriously. He began to answer my questions. When he said someone was at the door and would have to hang up, I failed to do this. He also stated that he saw something in the sky.
