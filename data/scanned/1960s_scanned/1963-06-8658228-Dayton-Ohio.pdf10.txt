The image appears to contain two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and a curved line labeled "B", and instructs the viewer to imagine being at the point shown and placing "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when last seen.

The second sketch shows two larger scenes. The larger scene on the left depicts a road leading through a wooded area, with a person standing on the road. The smaller scene on the right depicts a silhouetted landscape with a curved horizon and something in the sky.
