The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a diagram and drawing space. The diagram shows an illustration of a compass and provides instructions for the observer to imagine the position and direction of a sighted object. The text on the page asks the observer to draw a picture showing the motion and position of the object and any changes in its direction during the course.

The text found in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the compass at the high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion of the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
