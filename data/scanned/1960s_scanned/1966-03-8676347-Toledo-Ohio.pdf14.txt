A ranger, Cleve, who keeps in close touch with me, has told me that he had an experience one night this same month of March, 1966, when he was out on the highway near Erie, Ohio. He stopped to investigate a very large and brilliant light in the sky which seemed to be a red hot ball of fire of incredible brillianse (sic). When he was standing there, his car stalled and all the lights went out. He could hardly start it again. He said he stood there for 15 min. or so, watching this light in the sky and the stalling of his motor, with no apparent explanation. This is the first time, I believe, that a government or other official has confirmed any unusual strange happening like this in our area. I have not seen this light myself at any time, in secrecy, but of course I have heard many stories. In this particular case this ranger, who is a very reliable man, was greatly impressed and dumbfounded by the strange phenomena he witnessed. It seems to me that there was a large saucer-shaped object or some kind of a mysterious craft there, for his car motor to stall like that in its close proximity. I did see some strange lights in the sky near my home one night, but nothing as spectacular as what Cleve has described. However, that particular night was very hazy and overcast, and I could hardly see at all. I have not seen this light again since that night. This seems to be one thing - which I have not mentioned before. I have seen some strange things in the sky, which I cannot explain, but nothing as spectacular as what Cleve has described, and that is why I feel this is important to include in my report.
