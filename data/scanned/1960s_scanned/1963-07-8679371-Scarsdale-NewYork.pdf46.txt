22 july 1963
Scarsdale, New York

Another strange sighting. 
The story continues from...
(See previous paragraph)
From telephone call of:
white female, LIst name
unknown to me, who was
in Scarsdale, N.Y. and who
had seen what she called
a "flying saucer".
There was, according to
her, a silvery, circular
shaped object hovering in
the sky. It appeared to
be about the size of a
large moon, she said,
and was metallic in color.
It hovered for sometime,
then suddenly shot off at
a terrific speed, straight
up and out of sight.
The witness was quite 
excited and repeated several
times that it was not an
aircraft, but a "flying
saucer" type object. She
insisted on this point.
No other information
is available.
