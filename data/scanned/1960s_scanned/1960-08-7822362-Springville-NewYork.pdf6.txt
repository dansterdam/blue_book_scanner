IT was 9:55 - Friday night, 26 AUGUST, 1960 when I first observed a reddish bright light hovering around for awhile with my naked eye 8 material coming from the light. I looked at it for several minutes and it began to descend and I could see it was round and about 3 times the size of a star. When it was very close to the ground I could see more light coming from underneath it.  It hovered again for a little while and then shot straight up at a terrific speed and disappeared.
