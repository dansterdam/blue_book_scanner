The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. As requested, I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Don't believe this report because I saw something.

The report I'm sending you is based on the findings of extensive investigation conducted by officials from the U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book. The object observed was definitely not a conventional aircraft and could not be identified as any known type of aircraft. This incident was officially classified as "Unidentified".
