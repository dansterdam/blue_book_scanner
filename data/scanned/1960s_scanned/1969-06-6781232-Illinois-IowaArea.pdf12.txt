Text transcribed from the document:

The sighting began at a bean picker field where a man was working. A man in the field told us he saw the object and would like to say that the occurrence was at first entirely unpleasant, being as it was a totally unexpected personal experience. However, he stated that the object itself did not appear to have any really threatening quality, although it caused quite a turmoil among the people in the area. Everyone near who saw the object had heard of it just a few minutes before it actually appeared to have hovered motionless over the field for a short time, then moved off slowly enough for its silhouette to be clearly observed. The man in the field would gladly give any further information that might be of help in investigating the matter and would like to know if anything unusual was reported in the area that night.
