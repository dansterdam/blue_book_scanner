If the element of randomness is excluded, and it is assumed that life must arise in the presence of the necessary conditions (according to Ginditis many scientists think so) then p1 = 1.

Even with the above assumption there is no guarantee that once life has begun it will necessarily evolve into intelligent life. According to Professor A. A. Neyfakh (USSR) even insignificant differences in the physical conditions on different planets in comparison to terrestrial conditions can cause difference in the period of evolution by one or two orders of magnitude. 

Because intelligent life developed on earth, the factor p2 is greater than zero, but from the above discussion not necessarily equal to unity. Thus there is a definite probability that on a planet where some life has developed, this life at some time in the future will have evolved into intelligent thinking beings. As evident from the preceding discussion, it is not possible to determine this probability p2.

As described in the main text there is no agreement as to the time span of a civilization. One view is that the lifetime tc of a civilization is limited and regardless of its length (hundreds, thousands, or millions of years) is small when compared to the cosmic time scale T. Another view is that the lifetime of a technologically developed civilization is indefinitely large and can be only compared with the age of the oldest objects in the universe.
