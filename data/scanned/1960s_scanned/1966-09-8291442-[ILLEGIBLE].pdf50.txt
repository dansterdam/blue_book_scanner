Dear Sir:

I would like to inform Project Blue Book concerning the sighting of an unusual object. On the date mentioned, this object appeared to be in the vicinity of a jet aircraft, however, I am certain this object was not a part of the aircraft. 

I am planning to write a research paper concerning this sighting for an astronomy course. I would like to obtain any information possibly related to this sighting. If you have any photographs or other data concerning this event, I would greatly appreciate the use. Please send me the names and addresses of any such observers so that I might contact them for additional information. This is very important, and I would certainly appreciate your cooperation in this matter.

I would also please appreciate if you could send me a copy of the Air Force booklet, "A DE identification of Flying Objects" and a copy of the most recent Department of Air Force research concerning U.F.O.s.

Thank You Very Much,
[Signature]
