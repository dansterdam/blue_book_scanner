NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
25 November 1962
NORTHAMPTON, OHIO

MR. & MRS. JOSEPH TOMASILI were in their driveway, having just arrived home. Their attention was drawn to an object in the sky. They described it as being the apparent size of 14 moons. The object was moving toward the eastern horizon and was seen for a period of about one minute. The object was roughly circular in shape and had the general shape of a shield. It had an orange-red color, except for a silvery ring around the outer edge. The center of the object seemed to be emitting a pulsating ray glow, larger than the clear outline of the object. It moved toward the east and disappeared below the horizon. It appeared to be the same object or another with a different appearance as it returned and continued on the path of the first object. As the first object came into view, it seemed larger than the initial sighting and had the general shape of a shield. It had an orange-red color and a silvery outer ring. It emitted a pulsating ray glow, larger than the clear outline of the object. The sighting lasted about one minute. The object moved toward the east and disappeared below the horizon.
