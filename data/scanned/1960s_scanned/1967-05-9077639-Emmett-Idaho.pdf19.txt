PROPOSED REPLY TO SENATOR JORDAN

Dear Senator Jordan:

The attached copy of a letter to you from Mr. L. Gorman in reference to the alleged UFO photograph taken by two Emmett, Idaho boys indicates that the photo and story are hoaxes.

The Air Force receives hundreds of such reports each year, and many are obviously hoaxes. In the present case, the boys are apparently extremely clever to have looked into the possibility of existing as Attorney. It is fortunate that the boys admitted the hoax before additional time and money were expended on the investigation. I hope this information answers any question you may have about the matter.

Sincerely,

SAF-OICC
