The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page of a document, specifically a Project Blue Book report.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

I cannot say what this thing was, but I think it was designed to cause one of the familiar, and I worked with planes until leaving the Air Force only five months ago. It was not a balloon. It was not an astronomical body as we know it. It was not an aircraft under human control, nor a missile, for all I know. It was not a cloud, nor ball lightning. This I cannot prove, of course, but I am certain it was not a "mirage" or hallucination. 

It was a real and solid object of some kind, whichever it may have been. The flash had a bright incandescent ray, followed by a prolonged glowing. When the flash occurred, this object, or whatever it may be, had been moving rapidly, stopped completely dead. Then ran again, this object certainly had a force capable of attracting an electric system.
