REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
FALL RIVER, MASSACHUSETTS
JULY 16, 1966
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, BLUE BOOK CASE NO. 8283879
HYNEK, J. ALLEN - INVESTIGATOR
1. SUMMARY OF INCIDENT
At approximately 2335 hours on July 16, 1966, a Fall River, Massachusetts police officer observed an unidentified flying object in the sky approximately one mile northeast of the city. The object was described as about 50 feet in diameter, bright white in color, and traveling at a high rate of speed on a northeast heading.

2. DETAILS OF INCIDENT
The police officer was on routine patrol when he observed the object in the sky. The object appeared to be at an altitude of about 2,000 feet and was moving rapidly on a northeast heading. The officer stated that the object appeared to be solid and did not seem to have any wings or other visible means of propulsion. The officer watched the object for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared from view.

3. EVALUATION
This case is listed as a valid unidentified flying object (UFO) due to the credible witness (a police officer) and the detailed description provided. The object's large size, high speed, and lack of visible means of propulsion are consistent with reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. Further investigation may be warranted to determine the nature and origin of the object.
