The report: was flying from Chicago to Rochester and to Minneapolis, with four passengers; two businessmen and two technicians found for work at IBM. As they will forward report forms. The airplane was a Twin Bonanzo, * * * * *. 

The plane had just turned at Waukegan, having intercepted the 330degree radial from the Rochester omni. After no more than 5 minutes of flight, spotted ahead and to the right a distant glowing ball, "locking like a golf-ball", at about its altitude (6,000 feet). In about 5 seconds it came rapidly toward the airplane, so fact there was no time to evade though it would collide he could take no evasive action. The object, however, passed to the right, and stopped relative to the airplane; that it's stops and accelerated is immediately began passing the airplane, now off its right wing. The airplane was cruising at 230 mph.

The pilot had exclaimed and called the attention of the passengers to the object as it approached; all four saw it, and all were at a loss to identify it. The object kept pace with the airplane at close range, appearing many times the diameter which the moon would have had. It was a pale green color, had an indistinct edge, was almost white, and perhaps somewhat brighter than the full moon. The pilot called in to the Rochester Flight Service Station and reported the object just before he came in for a landing.
