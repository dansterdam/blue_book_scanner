According to the report, the object was very bright and moved at a high rate of speed. The observers stated that it appeared to be performing "acrobatic maneuvers" as it darted back and forth. After several minutes, the object suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from view.

This sighting occurred in Elmhurst, Illinois and involves a bright light that moved erratically in the sky. The light was observed by several people and was described as hovering and darting back and forth.
