BEACHNER AND POWERS --2 

The two witnesses observed the object on rounding the corner of the access road, heading into the area of the pit. At this time they would have been approximately 75 yards north of the pond. reported that the object had moved to a point which was across the pond and into the field, stating ho just "took a look and ran."

[Redacted] description of the object was vague. He described it as rectangular in shape, wider than high. He was scared by the incident and said that he was not anxious to see the object again.

INTERVIEWER'S COMMENT 

[Redacted] was more articulate and observant than [Redacted]. I was especially impressed by the difficulty he had in describing the quality of the light.

Both witnesses were uneasy during the interview, which, as mentioned earlier, was at the gravel pit area. Powers could be described as actually "jumpy." He would start at any unusual sound. No later moved the interview to a restaurant in town. Both witnesses were then more at ease.

Both witnesses mentioned that they had heard interference on their car radio at the time of the sighting. They identified the sound as being like a roar such as people talking overridden by the station to which they were listening. They were not sure that the interference was unusual and I consider the information to be inconclusive.

I believe that both of the witnesses saw something and that both reported their observations as best they could.
