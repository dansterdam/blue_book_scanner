INTERVIEW WITH [REDACTED]

([REDACTED] was interviewed by telephone. He related the following account of the incident:)

[REDACTED] and the two other witnesses to the sighting drove into the pit area and made a "U" turn which would stop the car facing them to the north.

On the right side of the hill, they observed a "light object" or "glow". The object was resting on the hill. It was described again as an oval shaped, glowing light.

Frombach had difficulty describing the nature of the glow. He best described it as a "shiny type of glow."

The object was estimated to be 25 to 50 feet across. It is estimated that the observers were 100 feet away from the object. Time was estimated at between 12:00 and 1:00 a.m.

No radio interference or electrical phenomenon was observed by Frombach. He stated that the car radio was not turned on at the time.

Length of observation was estimated at between five and ten minutes. The youths talked about how "weird" the object was and decided to leave town to get their friends.

[REDACTED] stayed in Vashon after the first sighting. [REDACTED] returned for a second time.
