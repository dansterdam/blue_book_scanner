MEMO FOR RECORD 
SUBJECT: UFO Observation

On 1 Oct 69, called Mr. Vealholler (spelling?)(Space Systems FTD) and gave preceding information to him. Will call back with answer to:

1. Was there a satellite launch from Vandenburg in 24 hours preceding sighting.
2. Identity of satellite.
It Toby will handle.
Both Lyra approximately at azimuth 260°; elevation 6°.

1425 hours 
1 Oct 69

Lt Toby called to say that there was a launch from Vandenburg within the previous 24 hours of the sighting (time not given to Lt Toby) of a multiple payload satellite that would correlate with sighting quite well. Engine should have been seen at 0117Z instead of 0117. I asked Lt Toby if Vandenburg could have made a mistake in their calculation of the time. He said that they said they had double checked it for him.

Lt Toby came back to say that the launch from Vandenburg put 11 objects in orbit. The first object was in a low orbit and passed over near about 1 hour before the sighting. The other 10 went into a higher orbit and would have been visible from his area at 0117Z on the 7th orbit. They were relatively close at that time and had a slow separation velocity. They were in a polar orbit.
