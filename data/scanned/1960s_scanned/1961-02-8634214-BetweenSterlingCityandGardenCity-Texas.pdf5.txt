LOWERED - THE ROAD ON WHICH THEY WERE DRIVING WAS ORIENTED GENERALLY EAST TO WEST, HOWEVER, THERE WERE TURNS AND DIPS IN THE ROAD. MR. ********** DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WAS SEEN WAS FAR MORE IMAGINATIVE AND COLORFUL THAN THE OLDER COUPLES DESCRIPTION. STATEMENTS MADE BY MR. ********** AS FACTUAL WERE FOUND TO BE CONTRADICTORY AND IN ONE CASE FALSE. A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WAS MADE INCLUDING THE MIDLAND U.S. WEATHER BUREAU, THE MIDLAND FLIGHT SERVICE STATION, EL PASO FLIGHT SERVICE CENTER, THE ABILENE SQUARE, WEBB AFB, DYESS AFB, HOWARD COUNTY AIRPORT, BIG SPRING TEXAS AND MIDLAND AIR TERMINAL. FLIGHT PLANS, UNUSUAL RADAR PLOTS AND ANY UNUSUAL AIR ACTIVITY WAS CHECKED WITH THE ABOVE AGENCIES. THE ONLY ITEM THAT MIGHT APPEAR A POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE THE NUMEROUS CIVILIAN TYPE AIRCRAFT WHICH FLY ABOUT AGENCIES.
