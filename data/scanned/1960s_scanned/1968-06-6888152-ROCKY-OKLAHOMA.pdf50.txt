TPPT (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/709/16/mhb/26 Jul 63
UFO Observation, 19 June 1969

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma which occurred on 19 June 1969 (sighting is about 10 miles north of Robert).

2. Although the sighting occurred sometime between 1:15 and 2:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time, the description is very similar to the electrical aerial advertising sign which appears to be the Piper Aztec at 4500' at 10032Z over Radio KWT. 

3. Since you own a Piper Aztec, we were wondering if your plane could have been in the area and possibly turned off for several minutes thus causing the UFO sighting. If your plane was not in the area at the time of the sighting, please let us know.

4. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.
