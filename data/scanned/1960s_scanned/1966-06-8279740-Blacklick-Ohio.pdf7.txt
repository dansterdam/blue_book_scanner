The image contains a diagram with various angles and measurements, as well as a compass-like illustration, but no photograph. The text within the image provides instructions for the viewer, such as placing an "A" on the curved line to show the height of an object above the horizon, and drawing a picture to show the motion of an object or objects.

DATA:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line (skyline) to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

90*    75*    60*    45*    30*    15*    0* 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. MORE THAN ONE OBJECT? If you saw more than one object, draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
