There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing instructions and a section for the witness to draw a picture of the observed phenomenon.

Outputting the text from the document:

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. HOW LARGE IS IT COMPARED TO THE DIAMETER OF THE RIGHTENING STROBE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING? ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE FULL MOON THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE COVERED.

The witness has noted: "Matter would have covered object."
