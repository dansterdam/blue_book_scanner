The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book, describing various types of UFO-related phenomena, such as balloons, satellites, and other objects that are not considered unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text extracted from the document:

Balloons continue to be reported as UFOs. Several thousand balloons are released each day from military and civilian airports, weather stations, and research activities. There are several types of balloons - weather balloons, communications balloons, and the large research balloons which have diameters up to 300 feet. At night, balloons carry running lights which cause an unusual appearance when observed. Reflection of the sun on balloons at dawn and sunset sometimes produces strange effects and distortions before the sun.  These balloons can move at speeds of over 100 miles per hour when moving in high altitude jet windstreams. These balloons sometimes appear to be stationary or to have lights mounted inside the bag itself due to the sun's rays reflecting through the material of the balloon. The Balloon Control Center at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, maintains a continuous around-the-clock surveillance of all balloon operations in the continental United States.  

Another category of UFO evaluations labeled Other includes missiles, reflections, mirages, searchlights, birds, kites, spurious radar indications, hoaxes, fireworks, and flares. Aircraft, satellites, balloons, and the like should NOT be reported since they do not fall within the definition of an unidentified flying object.
