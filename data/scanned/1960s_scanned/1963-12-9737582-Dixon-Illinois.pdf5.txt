The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with a series of questions and answers related to a UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It seemed to go at a terriffic speed sort of like a super-bullet

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one:)           YES          NO           Don't know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what:
It went behind small cloud and seemed to come out the other side right away

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one:)           YES          NO           Don't know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what:
It seemed to pass in front of a small cumulus cloud

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound  Left to Right  sounded softer each time it came into view
b. Color  Silvery whitish in color, kind of glowing  

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. About 1/2 inch of the match covered the object

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc. and especially show the direction the object was moving.
