Our four witnesses definitely saw an apparent UFO. The object was about 75 feet in diameter, round and only 10-15 feet off the ground, and moving at a slow rate of speed. It didn't see anything except the red lights.

The witness who had previously observed similar UFOs informed the others that he had seen these objects before. They reportedly have a steady, moving bright light in the center that pulsates and gives off a red glow. The witness stated that the objects are usually seen to the northeast or southwest of Clearwater, Florida.

When the object came near the witnesses, they felt a vibration and a buzzing sound, and the object seemed to attract the insects in the area. After a short time, the object moved away and the red lights went out. The witness stated that when the lights slowly descended, many observers were noting the observation, but shortly thereafter, the lights went out and the object was no longer visible.

In general, 12 or more of the witnesses were considered to be very accurate and reliable observers. Their descriptions were consistent, and they were all certain that the sighting was of a strange and unidentified object.
