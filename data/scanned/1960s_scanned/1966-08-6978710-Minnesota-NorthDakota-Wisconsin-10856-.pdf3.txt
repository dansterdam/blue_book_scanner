SIGHTING OF A DISC-SHAPED OBJECT
OVER MINNESOTA, NORTH DAKOTA, AND WISCONSIN
10856

On August 6, 1966, a strange, disc-shaped object was observed over the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin by many witnesses. The object was sighted by commercial and private pilots, as well as numerous ground observers.

Several reports described the object as a large, silvery, disc-shaped craft, moving at high speeds and performing abrupt maneuvers. Witnesses reported that the object would hover, then suddenly accelerate and dart across the sky.

The object was tracked on radar by both civilian and military installations. Readings indicated the object could reach speeds of over 3,000 miles per hour.

The Air Force investigated the sightings, but was unable to determine the nature or origin of the mysterious craft. The case remains unexplained in Project Blue Book, the official U.S. government program for investigating unidentified flying objects.
