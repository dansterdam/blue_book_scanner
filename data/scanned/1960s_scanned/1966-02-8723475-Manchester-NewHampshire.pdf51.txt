The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a blank page from a UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book. The page is labeled "FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION, AFSC" at the top and "UNCLASSIFIED" on both sides. The majority of the page is a solid black background with no other visual content.
