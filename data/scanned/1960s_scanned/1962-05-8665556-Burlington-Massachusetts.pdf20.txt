The purpose of this report is to summarize the investigation conducted by Project Blue Book personnel on a reported UFO sighting which occurred on the night of 8 May 1962 at the Hanscom Field Air Force Base in Burlington, Massachusetts.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE INCIDENT

At approximately 2315 hours on 8 May 1962, Captain Raymond E. Ryan, USAF, while driving on Route 128 near the Hanscom Field Air Force Base in Burlington, Massachusetts, observed what he believed to be an unidentified flying object.

Captain Ryan stated that as he was driving eastbound on Route 128, he noticed an extremely bright light in the sky to the southwest. The light appeared to be hovering, and at times seemed to be pulsing or flashing. Captain Ryan immediately pulled over to the side of the road to observe the object more closely.

After observing the object for several minutes, Captain Ryan stated that the light suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds.
