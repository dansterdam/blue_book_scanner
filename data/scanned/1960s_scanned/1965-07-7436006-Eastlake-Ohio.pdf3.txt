The image appears to contain handwritten text and a sketch-like drawing. Since the image does not contain a human face, I will proceed to describe the contents of the document as requested.

The handwritten text details an apparent UFO sighting, describing an object seen in the sky at around 10:15 PM on a certain date. The text discusses the object's size, shape, and movement, and mentions taking a photograph of the object. The sketch-like drawing appears to depict the object observed.

Dear Tom:

This involved date was a clear night &amp;  was probably witnessed by at least 10-15 persons in the area. It was what appeared to be a large lighted object, varying in apparent size, shape and movement. I was able to take a photograph of the object before it disappeared. The photograph appears to show a distinct shape of the object as I saw it.
