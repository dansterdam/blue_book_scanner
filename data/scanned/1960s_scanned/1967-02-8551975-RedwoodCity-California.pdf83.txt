14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

Gradually disappeared - The object was traveling behind some trees and disappeared behind them. 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

Yes - The object moved behind some trees.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? If you answered YES, then tell what.

Yes - The object moved in front of some clouds.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Absolutely cigar-this seemed unreal.
b. Color Bright white.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the match is covered by the object. If you find confirmed this, indicate measurements as a fraction of the match.

The object would have been covered 1/3 of the match stick.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch details of the object, such as the number of lights, if it had wings, tail, etc. Show motion, if any.

The sketch shows an elongated cigar-shaped object with scattered lights along its length. The object appears to be moving across the sky.
