Capt Heimbach - Was there turbulent or severe weather or lightning in the area.
Mr. --------- Lightning was off to the east from us. That is the reason we were turning to the south, down the eastern edge of the water zone instead of going on to Gross City. After the first object went off to the south, the 2nd object was almost in perfectly clear weather.
Capt Heimbach - Do you live in the Palm Beach area?
Mr. --------- No, I live in Garland, Texas.
Capt Heimbach - How long will you be in that area?
Mr. --------- We are leaving in the morning.
Mr. --------- Co-Pilot
This thing came at straight at us as it could come. I thought we were close to the warning zone (0x7d) and caused a little excitement. It was ready to pounce on us in a hurry. That thing looked like it was doing 2 to 3 thousand miles an hour. To the best of my judgement it would make complete left turns or right turns just about as fast as you could blink your eye. I have flown over 8000 hours in 3 years myself and there is not any jets that could fly like this. You don't have them that will go straight up and down like this was doing and then hover within seconds. Seems like it would put on brakes and then hover.
