Text extracted from the document:

Reason for sighting: Recently I became more interested in astronomy than usual. As I was gazing I perceived to notice a white round object below the constellation Ursa Major. As I moved it it disappeared behind the street light glare. When it reappeared it traveled for a little then it suddenly became brighter. Then below this I saw the object with green, and red sparks as marked in that order.
