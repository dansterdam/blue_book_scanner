Gentlemen:

I am enclosing five reports of sightings of UFO's, the first of which I reported by a Lt. Sutton of the Laredo AFB, Texas, and since he informed me that I would be contacted by Washington, I have continued to make some more observations. Today I called the Laredo Base and was told that Lt. Sutton had been transferred out some time ago, and a Captain Ellis suggested that I write to you direct with my reports.

I am very much interested in knowing what it is that I am seeing, if at all possible, and I would very much appreciate a reply from your good offices after evaluation of my reports.

Thank you for your attention.

Yours very truly,
[Signature redacted]

Encls.
