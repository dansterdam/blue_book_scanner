JUN 7 1967

Dear Mrs. [Redacted],

This replies to your recent correspondence concerning a material which was reported to your office on May 14, 1967. The material was identified as "radar chaff." This material is dropped from aircraft to confuse the radar operators so that the aircraft can maneuver the radar screens. There must have been one of these radar exercises in your area.

We wish to thank you for submitting the material to the Air Force for analysis. Attached is a fact sheet on electronic countermeasures which we think you will find interesting.

Sincerely,

BARNETT B. YOUNG
