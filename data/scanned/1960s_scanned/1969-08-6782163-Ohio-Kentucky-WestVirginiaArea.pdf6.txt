I first spotted the object by the glow from the engine itself, it was bright and seemed to be pinpointed on an object while the glow from the object spread over an area too wide to look like the engine itself. The blueish white glow was quite distinct and seemed to be caused by some type of reaction, the object was definitely not an ordinary aircraft or meteor. It seemed to move in a straight line for a short period and then suddenly disappeared to the south.
