The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a hand-written document or report. As per the instructions, I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

I believe this object I saw and observed was a satellite. It moved from south to north and would be approar between 90 and 110 minutes each time it appeared. It was further west than first seeing this object. I have looked for it at the same place i first saw it and it was not there again. Each night we observed it we saw it twice in the time mentioned above. I have seen it or one like it about two nights since first seeing it. It would pass over far then west man might. We only saw it on two passes each night.
