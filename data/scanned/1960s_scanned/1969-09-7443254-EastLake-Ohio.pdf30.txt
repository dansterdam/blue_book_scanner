The main visual elements in the image are:

1. A large diagram or map in the center that appears to show some kind of terrain or landscape, with labeled contours and elevation markings.
2. A smaller diagram or chart in the bottom-left corner that looks like a scatter plot or distribution of some kind of data points.
3. A smaller diagram or chart in the bottom-right corner that also appears to show some kind of data distribution or scattering.
