The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with text describing the findings of a radioactivity check and conclusions based on the examination of the sample.

Text extracted from the document:

WAS FOUND STICHED BY EMISSION SPECTROGRAPHIC OR BY INFRARED ABSORPTION ANALYSIS. SMALL AMOUNTS OF SOME ELEMENTS ARE PRESENT TO WHICH ARE POSSIBLY FOR COLORING AND WOULD NOT BE DETECTED ORDINARILY BY INFRARED OPTICAL ANALYSIS AT THESE LOW CONCENTRATIONS.

RADIOACTIVITY CHECK

A CHECK FOR RADIOACTIVITY OF THE SAMPLE, MEASURED WITH A SURVEY METER, SHOWED LITTLE IF ANY RADIATION ABOVE THE NORMAL BACKGROUND LEVEL.

CONCLUSIONS

BASED ON THE ABOVE DESCRIBED EXAMINATION AND DATA OUR CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT THE SAMPLE IS A PIECE OF GREEN-COLORED POLYSTYRENE PLASTIC OF THE INEXPENSIVE TYPE COMMONLY USED FOR TOYS, TILE, ETC. SINCE (1) POLYSTYRENE OBJECTS ARE NOT COMMONLY REINFORCED WITH CLOTH, (2) THE CHARRED CLOTH TREATMENT ONLY ON ONE SIDE OF THE OBJECT, (3) THE ODOR AND INFRARED DATA ON THE SURROUNDING EARTH INDICATES THAT IT WAS PROBABLY SATURATED WITH FUEL OIL, AND (4) THE PLASTIC WAS APPARENTLY HOT ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN MOLTEN, IT IS INDICATED LIKELY THAT THIS IS MERELY A PLASTIC OBJECT WHICH HAS BEEN COVERED WITH A COTTON CLOTH SATURATED WITH FUEL OIL AND BURNED AT A HIGH ENOUGH TEMPERATURE TO CAUSE THE PLASTIC TO BECOME MOLTEN. IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THE OBJECT ENTERED FROM OUTSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE SINCE THE MOLTEN FATE OF POLYSTYRENE IS LOW AND THE OBJECT WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE BURNED COMPLETELY UPON ENTERING THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.
