Another mystery hole 
The Southampton Southern Evening News of February 12 add another to the list of mysterious craters or disposal experts are to examine - a mysterious crater which has suddenly appeared in a ploughed field at Blackstead, near Stanbridge. They formed a short cut across the field from the work last night, saw a depression in the ground and they reported the matter to the police.
Police officers from Ampfield, and Winchester, with Mr. David Eustis, reported to the spot. They probed the crater for an hour before they could find its bottom. They came to the opinion that the depression was caused by a wartime bombâ€”there were many dropped in the vicinity which exploded deep down in the ground.
The center of the cavity is on Hursley Chalk Farm, and examining Mr. Butler's farm buildings at the west side, while the bomb theory seemed to be the most likely theory, there was the possibility that the Romans occupation of the area centuries ago (credit to Miss V. R. West).
