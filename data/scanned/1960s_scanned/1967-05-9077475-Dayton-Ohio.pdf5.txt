17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - LO

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a sketch that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object, such as size, proportions, etc., and specifically show trails or vapor trails. Place on this inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
