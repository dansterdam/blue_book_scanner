Dear Sir:

I am writing to tell you about an incident that occurred about 7:50 -8:00 P.M. on April 2, 1966.
A friend and I were in a car, one of the other passengers observing. The object first appeared to the Northwest, coming from the direction of Vermont, moving rapidly and descending in altitude. It appeared to be circular, somewhat larger than the full moon, and brilliantly illuminated, with a pale blue-green color. The light was not diffused but seemed to emanate from the object itself, casting a faint glow on the surrounding clouds and terrain. The object moved rapidly, in a straight course, and then made an abrupt turn to the west and continued on toward the Adirondack Mountains area of New York State. The object was in sight for approximately 2-3 minutes. I cannot say with certainty whether or not there was any sound associated with it. 
This is a brief account of the incident as I observed it. I would be most interested in any further information you may have regarding similar sightings or your opinion as to the nature of this object.

Yours very truly,
