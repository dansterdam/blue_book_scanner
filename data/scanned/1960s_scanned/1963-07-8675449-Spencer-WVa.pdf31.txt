this before 'One of his men' later told suggested that his delicate behavior was wildly This is a crucial that he was 'completely out of contact with reality'

It soon becomes clear that the events now to be described by means at this call for the critical scientific attention of the Ministry of Defence and attention of the scientific community. It would appear that if Doctor R. Hunter had not subjected himself to an investigation, and had the matter remained undisclosed, the truth concerning this mysterious occurring would never have come to light.

On July 16, it was reported that Captain Roger had sighted an object and that his men had encounted something 'entirely out of the ordinary' on Salisbury Plain. Dr. Hunter, told me that a small ball of light about 18 inches in diameter had been observed for several hours on the evening of July 16. This light, he said, had behaved in a most extraordinary manner, moving rapidly up and down, darting about, and finally disappearing into the distance. The doctor, who had been nearby, had watched this light for some considerable time. He told me that it had 'danced around' in a most unusual way, and that it appeared to be intelligently controlled.

On July 19, the same Dr. Hunter told me that a further investigation, carried out on his behalf by a number of his personal friends, had revealed that a deep trench, some 40 feet long and 3 feet wide and deep, had been discovered on Salisbury Plain. This trench, which had been carefully examined, showed signs of having been recently dug. The earth around the trench was found to be heavily compressed, as though some great weight had rested there. In addition, there were clear impressions in the earth, as though made by the landing gear of some heavy object.

Dr. Hunter told me that the trench was located in a marshy area of the plain, and that the compressed earth and landing impressions strongly suggested that some kind of craft had landed there. However, he said, the trench was not deep enough to have been dug by hand, and there were no tools or other debris in the immediate vicinity. The doctor expressed the opinion that the trench had been caused by the landing of some unknown object, which had then taken off again, leaving these curious marks behind.

On July 20, the same Dr. Hunter told me that a further and more detailed investigation had been carried out, and that the trench had been subjected to careful scientific examination. The results of this examination, he said, clearly indicated that the trench had been caused by the landing of some heavy object, which had then taken off again. Dr. Hunter told me that the trench was approximately 40 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 3 feet deep, and that the compressed earth around it, together with the landing impressions, strongly suggested that it had been caused by the landing of some kind of craft.
