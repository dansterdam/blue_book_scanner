Contact was made with the 93rd BW, Castle AFB, Calif, regarding aircraft departures and arrivals in the Eugene, Oregon area on this date. The aircraft were F-102 interceptors from the 142nd FIG, Oregon ANG based at Portland, Oregon. They were on a training flight and would have been airborne at 0235 and 0255. These aircraft would have been traveling toward the Eugene area and after passing the Eugene Crater would have been returning to their base. The weather at the time would have been instrument conditions. These aircraft would have been passing near the town of Corvallis, Oregon at 4:34 AM.

Contact was made with Maj. Shirritt, Adair AFS, Oregon. Maj. Shirritt interviewed the West Coast Radar Control Officer. He did not contact the FAA. The weather bureau reported a ceiling of 6000 feet and overcast, but there was no indication of unusual lighting at the time of the sighting. Major Shirritt will check with the FAA and call back with additional information.

Major Shirritt called back to say that he had checked with the FAA. There was an aircraft inbound from the south that landed at Eugene, Oregon. Major Shirritt said there are numerous small private aircraft in the area being told of the KC-135's in the area, he said this did not indicate that the aircraft observed were being told of the KC-135's. He said that if appears that a small aircraft was observed within the flying path.  

It should be noted that two of the observers said that the clouds were either broken or thinly scattered. If the clouds were broken as all during the observation the two KC-135's could have been seen.
