The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old report document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was the United States Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text output from the image is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes   No    Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No    Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with the known object and measure how much of the match head would have been covered by the object at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head.

19. Of course the object itself was not necessarily shaped like the match head. In your sketch, indicate the shape and size of the object as accurately as you can recall. Include in your sketch any details such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially the color and vapor trails or other trails if any.
