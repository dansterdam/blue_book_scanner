This is where the trail started. It was 10:35 at night. The moon was bright. The object was oblong in shape and was about 15-20 feet long. It was flying at a high rate of speed at an estimated 1000-1500 feet altitude. It slanted down and then up again and was white in color. It made no sound whatsoever. I watched it for about 10-15 seconds and then it was gone. There was no fire or tail visible. It couldn't have been a plane, helicopter or anything else we are accustomed to seeing in the sky. This is why I say it was a UFO. I did not report this incident to anyone at the time. It didn't seem important enough. But now that I've heard about the Air Force's Project Blue Book, I am wondering if I should have reported it. If you can shed any light on what I might have seen, please let me know. I'd be very interested to find out. Thank you for your consideration.
