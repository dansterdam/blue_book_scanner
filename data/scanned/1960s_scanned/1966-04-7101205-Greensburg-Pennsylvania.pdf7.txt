34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 9th June 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or a narrative explanation in your sighting:
If some details which I tried to give are not readable, I do regret this. However, the details which I did try to give here are as accurate as I can make them.
When I first saw the object(s) it was about 15 or 20 ft above the ground. I could see no whole or complete outline but only a curved, lighted thing about the size of a car coming across the field where I was. There were no markings or any way to identify it as being from any known source and I wonder what the object(s) was or could have been. There were no sounds that I recall, but there was a glow or lights showing only on the lower portion that I could see. It did not stay in view but moved across the field and out of sight very quickly.
