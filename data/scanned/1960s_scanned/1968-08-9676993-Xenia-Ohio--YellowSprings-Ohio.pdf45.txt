TEET (U.P.O.)
Yellow Springs, Ohio, 15 Aug 63 sighting

Dr. Donald H. Menzel 
Harvard College Observatory
60 Garden Street
Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138

Dear Dr. Menzel:

Would you please give me your opinion on the attached case. I hesitantly don't feel that this case should be unidentified. I am not at all pleased with Dr Hynek's interview or with his evaluation. 

I've also included a map of the area, however, I would appreciate your returning it when you are through. Thank you.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr. Lt Colonel, USAF 
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
