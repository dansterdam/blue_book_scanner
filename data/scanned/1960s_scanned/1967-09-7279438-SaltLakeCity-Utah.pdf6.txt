There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a typed letter describing an unidentified flying object sighting.

The text in the letter is as follows:

Dear Sir:

Below we have given a complete report on the unidentified flying object that we sighted last night:

On Saturday night, September 23, 1967, shortly before 9:00 P.M., we were riding out Route 35, south along South Cottonwood Drive. About five to seven miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah, we spotted an object some four to five miles away, and was roughly three times as bright as the most brilliant star. As the object approached, it was as bright as a headlight bulb. They say from the brilliant white light, there were no other lights visible. It moved slowly, it would stop, it was silent. We decided to stop our car. When we got out, it seemed to wobble after a while. It crossed in front of our view, and it did not disappear. We could see it moving extremely low, hovering over some lights which seemed to wobble also. The object was in sight from four to seven minutes.

We do not want any publicity whatsoever, and for all we care, you can throw this letter away once it is explained. Most of the people (including my family, G.H.) that we know are skeptical and they might never let us live it down if they find out we have reported it.

Sincerely,
