UKCLAS DCCCIC 2444 FINAL SECTION OF TWO.
FIELD HAS BEEN IN THE USAF FOR YEARS AND IS ON FLYING STATUS AT 
THE PRESENT TIME. THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT HIS RELIABILITY AND 
CERTAINLY WITH HIS EXPERIENCE, HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AN OBJECT. 
WERE IT ACTUALLY AN AIRCRAFT. MOST OF THE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE 
ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVERS WITHIN 150-225 YARDS OF THE OBJECTS. 
THEY COULD SEE THE LIGHTS, BUT COULD NOT HEAR A SOUND OF ANY SORT.
NOR SEE ANY SILHOUETTES OF THE OBJECTS THEMSELVES. THE PREPARING 
OFFICER, THE BASE POLICE OFFICER AND THE SECURITY OFFICER WENT OVER  
THE GROUND WHERE THE OBJECTS WERE SUPPOSE TO HAVE SETTLED, BUT
THEY COULD NOT FIND ANY EVIDENCE.
