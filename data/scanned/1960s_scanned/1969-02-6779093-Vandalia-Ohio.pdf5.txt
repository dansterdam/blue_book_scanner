The image contains three illustrations:

1. A compass rose diagram, with various directional labels such as North, East, South, and West.
2. A landscape illustration showing a road or path leading towards a horizon.
3. A smaller landscape illustration showing a road or path leading towards a horizon.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

AS NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE - PLACE AN X AT THE CENTER TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 5° ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A 5° AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE X AND 5° WITH A LINE TO REPRESENT THE PATH OF THE PHENOMENON. IF THE PATH IS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
