On the night of Oct. 13, 1967 at about 9:30 PM CDT I was sitting outside my house when I noticed a bright light in the northern sky. It was a clear night with a few scattered clouds. At first I thought it was a star or planet but as I watched it the light began to move back and forth and up and down. It was much brighter and larger than any star or planet I have ever seen. It seemed to be silvery in color and was about the apparent size of a quarter. I called my wife out to see it and she also witnessed the object for several minutes before it suddenly disappeared behind some clouds. It was not making any sound that I could hear.
I have never seen anything like this before and was quite puzzled by what it could be. I am an amateur astronomer and have seen many of the planets, stars and other celestial objects and this was definitely not any of those. It seemed to be some type of aircraft but was unlike any conventional aircraft I have ever seen before. I would be very interested to know if anyone else in the area reported seeing the same object that night."
