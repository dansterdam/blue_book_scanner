Slightly suspended as might seem.
During the summer there are
people staying in their summer 
cottages nearby. Last night (Wednesday
July 17) it was about 1 o'clock in
the morning. I was awake, looking
out the window. An object
(which I have designated flying
saucer) flew across the upper part
of the window, then I lost sight
of it. It flew too high to be easily
to see too be the moon, and it
did not in any way resemble
any planes or helicopters that I
know. It seemed to be some a
unusual type of aircraft.
