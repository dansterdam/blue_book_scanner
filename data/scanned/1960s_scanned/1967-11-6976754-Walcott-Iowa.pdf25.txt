About a week ago I returned your thief #709 or model on your 21st & form. Do not send me any more to look at or handle. I do not wish to be involved with these cases any longer. I find that I do not have the information necessary nor the time to devote to them. One or more of them Dr. Pagliaro and some other fellows from WSU (perhaps "UFO") say I am a quack and my findings are useless. However, it might be best if you do not send me any more of these things for the time being. I thought it was best to return the one I had. As in the past, I have written up some suggestions, but I have tried to indicate why I feel I cannot handle these matters. I am returning BF's written material as it is not up to standard and I have done every thing I can to help in this matter.
