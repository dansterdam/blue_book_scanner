The image does not contain any photographs, it is a page from an old UFO report document that includes sketches and text. The sketches show a compass rose and a diagram illustrating the motion of an object or objects. The text contains instructions and questions related to these sketches.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture to show how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
