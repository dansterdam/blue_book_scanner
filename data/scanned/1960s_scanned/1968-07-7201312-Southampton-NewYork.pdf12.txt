Enclosed is the UFO report you submitted to the Air Force for a UFO of 23 July 1968. The physical examination of the report indicates that the image in the photographs has been masked out completely. 

The report indicates that this was a polaroid print containing an alleged UFO. The image in the photograph is so completely masked that there is no basis to examine or evaluate this claim. Your original photographs have been returned to you.
