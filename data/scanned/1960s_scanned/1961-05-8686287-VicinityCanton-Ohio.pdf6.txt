The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

TO: Major Quintanilla
Subject: Project Bluebook

Date: 8 May 1961

Dear Sir:
Attached is a report of a UFO sighting in the vicinity of Canton, Ohio, on 7 May 1961. The witness is a reliable person in the community and his account appears to be credible. He states that he observed a stationary, round, metallic object for approximately 5 minutes at an altitude of about 1000 feet. The object then accelerated rapidly and departed the area.

I recommend that this case be considered for further investigation.
