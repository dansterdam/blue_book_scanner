THE SOUTHAMPTON WHO SAW UFO
Share Views With Reporter
The Southampton resident who saw an unidentified flying object over the northeast portion of the town has shared his views with a Long Island Press reporter.
The observer, 49-year-old resident, said he sighted the strange object at about 1:00 a.m. Wednesday, October 5, 1966, as he was driving home along Flying Point Road.
He said the object was luminous, appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter, and was approximately 300 feet above the ground. It had no wings or visible means of propulsion.
The object, the observer said, hovered for about 15 minutes, then shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared.
The observer, who asked that his name be withheld, said he was quite surprised and shaken by the experience and had reported it to the Air Force.
