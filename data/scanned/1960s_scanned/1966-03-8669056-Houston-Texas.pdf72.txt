SERIAL NO. 20011 
POLICE DEPARTMENT, WESTPORT, CONN.
Date: March 22, 1966 
Time: 8:00 P.M. 
Tuesday March 22, 1966
By: Sgt. Marks 
Phone: Personal Call
Name of Complainant: Jane Doe 
Nature of Complaint: REPORTS:
That the unknown object flying over Westport may be being sent up by students at Staples High.

Investigated by: Sgt. Marks 
Follow Up: None

REMARKS:
On March 23, 1966, I went to Staples High and spoke to Mr. X and Mrs. Y and advised them about what students had said about sending up some object at 3:30 PM on this date. He said the school did not have any knowledge of this group of boys and would look into it. He said he would have to see such an object to verify it. I then spoke to a 19 year old boy who stated he had seen an object with bright lights and lens buying surplass weather balloons in NYC and filling them and sending them along during the evenings. He had one unusual one the other night. I said he should not be doing anything like that as it was unwise and could cause an airplane to strike it, but I do not think he was the one that sent up the objects over Westport as he never mentioned that. They were told to stop sending up these objects and it was suggested a warrant may be issued for them.
