SUBJECT: REPORT OF UFO
25 January 1967
A M_____  Howard Lake, Minnesota age 32 years, called to report the following incident:
He was on his way to work this morning (works for the Gleason Construction Company) and between 4:30 and 5:00 AM, south of Howard Lake near highways 101, 5 and 212, his pickup truck quit. He went out and looked under the hood and he noticed a very bright light to his right "like a light from a welder's torch". It came closer and landed on the highway. He became frightened and ran into the car and locked the doors. This light was approximately 75 feet long and 30 feet wide. While he was watching it the light went out and they were gone. He made a loud whirring noise and he could hear the windows of the car. 
Then an elevator like object came out of the bottom and a man walked out. He was dressed in a silver blue tight fitting suit with a "fish bowl" on his head. He was of average height and built. He walked over to the side of the "thing" to check on something then walked back in. It then took off. It all took about three or four minutes.
Mr. A. sounded quite upset. He asked what he should do. I asked if he had called the newspaper. He said no, and wondered if I had had any other calls reporting this incident. I said no. He said he was going to call his wife and then report further what should be done. I told him I would contact him if we heard further concerning this UFO. He said he wasn't drunk and doesn't read much and is of sound health. He does wear glasses but his eyes were normal.
