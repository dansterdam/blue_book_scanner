The image shows a page from an old document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The page contains two sections with instructions and diagrams.

The first section instructs the viewer to imagine a point on a curved line and to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when it was first seen. It also asks the viewer to place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when it was last seen.

The second section instructs the viewer to draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made, placing an "A" at the beginning of the path and a "B" at the end of the path, and showing any changes in direction during the course.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
