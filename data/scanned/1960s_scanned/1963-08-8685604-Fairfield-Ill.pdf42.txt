were many requests from the press and the sighting was attracting
limited interest it was decided to complete the investigation
with personne\ from Wright-Patterson.

Subsequent to the field investigation additional corroborating of
eyewitness accounts made by the witnesses in interviews at the control center confirmed the low altitude flights and Kansas City for high altitude cross over
from this direction was one miles ahead of the sighting and the
controllers at the TVA tower at Evansville TWA 505 was visible from
Evansville to St Louis at 10:15:02. Eastern Airlines flight 505 over
Evansville in 05: hr: 45:05. The sighting under observation was only
a few minutes at the most. A check of Evansville Radar and Eastern Airlines
made to Little Rock Arkansas (Controller for Sandy Spot Refueling
Base) established that no unidentified aircraft refueled during the
0200-0500 time. It was determined that the Upoff sighting was a misinterpretation of the 505 flight.

Call made to Ft Campbell, KY, PFC Rottinore (Operations) checked
records to ascertain that transcribed data was not in use. Call to
Evansville, Indiana, Civilian Defense also failed to disclose any
rule 4 type of activity or sightings of flares being the cause of
the sighting. The "Toy Tank" used over Evansville and left the remaining
possibility of their sighting as a meteor.
