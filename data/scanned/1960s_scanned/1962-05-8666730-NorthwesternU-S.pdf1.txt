PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 26 may 1962
2. LOCATION: Elgin, Ont., Canada
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local
4. DURATION: 5 min.
5. PHOTOS: 0
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: O Ground-Radar
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 min.
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 3 sourse
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Blinking bright green and white streaked lights moving erratic in all directions, appearing and disappearing. Lights at times seemed to be in a line and at other times in a cluster, and at times would form into one light and then separate. Lights were very much larger and brighter than stars.
11. COMMENTS: This description gives no indication that this was anything more than a normal aircraft. The blinking, erratic movement, and variable grouping of the lights are all characteristic of aircraft lights as seen from a distance. There is no evidence to indicate that this was an unidentified object. There is no indication of any physical observable details that could suggest this was any kind of special or unusual aerial phenomenon. The report itself is not one that provides any substantial evidence to warrant further investigation as an unidentified flying object.
