"Being sending my version of the sighting of the U.F.O.'s as you requested it is writing.

October 23, 1965

I was driving along a dirt road about 0330 hours when I came to the end of the road and stopped to check on the engine and as I started to work on the lights I saw 2 objects in the sky straight ahead but at approximately a 30 degree angle. the objects were in the southern part of the sky they were quite large and seemed to be stationary. I would say they ranged from 40 feet to 60 feet in diameter and were shaped somewhat like a dishpan. they were a very bright orange reddish color and at times became quite brilliant and then dimmed just a little bit. after watching them for some 10 minutes or more they started to move upward and moved across the sky going west then they lit very bright and then just went out of sight. I was just completely amazed at what I saw and felt like I wanted to pinch myself to see if I was dreaming. but I know it was no dream and the experience is one that I shall never forget. now I know there has been a lot of jokes and sighting of unidentifiable objects but this was the first time I have ever seen anything like this and it was truly an unbelieveable sight."
