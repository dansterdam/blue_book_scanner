1. We are returning the enclosed AF Form 117s on sightings of 1 June and 7 June 1963. The sightings have not been investigated in accordance with AFR 80-17 as the AF Form 117 is used only to gather statistical data and is not to be used by itself in reporting a UFO observation.

2. After the prescribed preliminary investigation you cannot identify the stimulus or have caused the sighting, you only may tentatively identify the stimulus or if the sighting is too old to investigate properly, the report is held for six months and then destroyed in accordance to AFM 127-5, 1 December 1952, paragraph 11.011.
