To call regarded the police dept. They were more curious as to what i saw than helpful. It was a small disc of some kind, about the size of a large hubcap, and they basically said it was still being investigated.

They did come and get their description and what I told them. However there was still many unanswered questions and I'm not sure where the investigation went.

Where does one go?? The case was quickly dismissed, as many of these reports. The news media were only interested in the strange and bizarre, and very little real concern for what was happening or coming. The descriptions vary but I'm not sure it makes any difference, They put the citizen off as if it was nothing and unimportant. I don't wish to pressure, where does one go for a reasonable explanation and concern?
