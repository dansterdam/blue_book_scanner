Well, they tell nothing. 
The object appeared to be about 500 yards away and moving very rapidly, appearing and disappearing in a few seconds. The object appeared slightly oval in shape and seemed to reflect some light. The date and time were January 8, 1966 at approximately 8:04 P. M. 
The location was somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean at approximately 30 to 31 degrees north latitude and 70 to 71 degrees west longitude. The object seemed to be heading in a northeast direction.
Weather conditions were clear with unlimited visibility and no clouds present.
The observer was a pilot flying at an altitude of approximately 36,000 feet. No other aircraft were observed in the vicinity at the time.
I have no other details to report on this sighting. Please advise if you need any additional information.
