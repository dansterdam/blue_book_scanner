In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object (or objects) were when you first saw them. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object (or objects) were when you last saw them.

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" or "C" to show any changes in direction during the course.

If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
