A brief description of the phenomenon, indicating whether it appeared dark or light, whether it was transparent, whether edges were sharp or fuzzy, describe the shape or indicate if it was a point of light. State clearly whether or not the object was observed to move.

The object was a large, orange, fuzzy, globular cloud with a red-orange center that appeared to gradually increase in size. It had a hazy, indistinct surface and appeared to be moving very slowly, almost stationary. There was no noise associated with the object. It remained visible for about 15-20 minutes before gradually fading from view.
