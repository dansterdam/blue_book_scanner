The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with handwritten notes and questions.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"IT MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE
SLOWLY SPEEDED UP AND RUN AWAY!
SLOWLY UP IN PARTS AND DESCEND.
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
STAND STILL MOTIONLESS
PLANE OR FLICKER?
APPEARS AND DISAPPEAR?
MAKE A NOISE?
WHAT WAS LOOKING AT GEORGE WASHING TON'S BODY?
AND IT STARTED DISAPPEARING
ALSO CAPPED OUT?
AND THEN IT DISAPPEARED

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Capped out and it started disappearing.
And then it disappeared.

B. DID THE PHENOMENA MOVE BEING ON IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING?
When it was going away it went by a cloud for a while."
