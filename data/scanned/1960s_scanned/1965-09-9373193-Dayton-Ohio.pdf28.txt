ORIGINAL FORECAST LINES OF DAMAGE.
WAS DESCRIBED BY WEATHERMEN AS MUCH UNDER WHAT IT ACTUALLY WAS (NEW ORLEANS).
PREVIOUSLY RALEY HAD REPORTED HEAVY SEAS FENDER BENDER HOMES AT GULF SHORES, ALA.
HOUSES, TRAILERS, AND BANKS NEAR BEACHES WERE DESTROYED BY WINDS AND WAVES.
BRIDGE ON HGY A-1-A, FROM FT. LAUDERDALE TO POMPANO BCH, COVERED BY SANDS AND DEBRIS.
BEACHES AND FT. LAUDERDALE AREA HIT HARDER THAN EXPECTED.
MANY PEOPLE ASKED TO EVACUATE
WAVES STILL HIGH ENOUGH TO SPLASH OVER SEAWALL.
HUNDREDS SEE WARY SHY 2222
WHATEVER IS WAS, IT PLAYED HELL WITH HUNDREDS OF LIVES.
FEDERAL AVIATION AGENCY, SAID THERE WAS A REPORT OF A CRAFT BEING OBSERVED 5 TO 10 SECONDS ON THE RADAR CONTROL TOWER REPORTED A CALL FROM A CONTROL CENTER REPORTING A SMALL OBJECT ENTERED AND LEFT THEIR RADAR SCOPE IN ABOUT 4 SECONDS.
POST TOWER DIRECTOR, SAID THAT ON THIS MATTER INTERCEPTING JET PLANES WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL BECAUSE OF THE BRIEF TIME THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED.
THIS SEEMS VERY SKETCHY, LOGICALLY EXPLAINED, AND NOT TO BE ??? EITHER A MORE THOROUGH REPORT OR SOME BETTER QUALITY OBSERVATIONS WOULD BE NEEDED.
