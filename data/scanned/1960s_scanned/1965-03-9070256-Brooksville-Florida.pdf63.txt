UFO Sleuthing Tabs Spaceman Tale Hoax
According to the text, an article reports that the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio investigated a claim that a "flying saucer" had landed in March and that a "spaceman" had emerged from it. The article states that this was determined to be a hoax, with the "spaceman" being someone's attempt to perpetrate a hoax.

The text also discusses an analysis of the alleged landing site, which found no radioactivity in the area and concluded that the object could not have been seen for more than five seconds as it was claimed.
