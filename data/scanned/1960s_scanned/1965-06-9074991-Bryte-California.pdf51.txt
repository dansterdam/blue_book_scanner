Hershey Man's 'Saucer' Photo 
Noll, who lives another Lancaster area, claimed to capture three saucers in the sky over his home June 30. He says the objects were hovering over a cornfield in plain view, but when his own photo is examined, the bright object is there, but what appears to be the three saucers 
are very small and faintly visible, obscured apparently by haze or other atmospheric conditions.
Noll, who is 36 and is employed in the Hershey area, said he goes on overnight hikes and camping trips on weekends and feels that there may be a connection between these activities and his saucer sightings. He said he has seen other strange objects in the sky on several other occasions.
