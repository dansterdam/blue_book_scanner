STATE OF VERMONT 
DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES
MONTPELIER

8 January 1965

Mr. Walter H. Webb 
Astronomer
Planetarium Bldg. Harvard College Observatory
Cambridge 38, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Webb:

It was advised to me by communication of January 26, 1964, that a complete file of Project Blue Book case files involving Vermont incidents are in your possession and the State of Vermont is interested in obtaining copies of these files.

We have looked at the material with Dr. J. Allen Hynek previously and have photocopies of considerable material which have been distributed to various agencies. However, we would like you to send to this office, copies of the three minor Vermont incident files which were not among those copies previously distributed.

The addresses were:
1. 25-338 and occurring on December 23, 1957 near Bethel, Vermont.
2. 25-339 and occurring on January 8, 1958 near Bethel, Vermont.
3. 25-340 and occurring on January 8, 1958 near Bethel, Vermont.

These are the only Vermont files that we do not have copies of and we would appreciate your forwarding them to this office at your earliest convenience.

There are no notes at any time. This objective was to have all of the Vermont material assembled in one location and available for any future reference. 

Sincerely yours,

/s/ Donald W. Webster
Administrative Assistant
