Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I have mentioned in my earlier statement the number of points that I can recall, and I do not wish to repeat them. However, there are a few points and comments that I would like to make. The object that I saw was large in size, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and was hovering about 50 feet above the ground. It was emitting a bright light that was illuminating the ground and trees below. The light was not concentrated in a beam, but rather a diffuse light that spread out over a large area. I am quite certain that this was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. I watched the object for several minutes as it hovered silently, then suddenly it accelerated and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. I realize that my report may seem unbelievable to some, but I can assure you that I am telling the truth to the best of my recollection. I hope that this additional information is helpful in your investigation.
