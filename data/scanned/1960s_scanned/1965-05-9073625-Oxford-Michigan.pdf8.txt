Dear Sir:

At approximately 7:30 to 7:40 P.M. on Friday the 7th day of May, 1965 the following incident occurred:

My 13-year old son, my 7-year old daughter and I had just moved our family into our new home in Oxford, Michigan. We were outside and called my attention to a strange object directly overhead. He pointed out the shiny object which was silver in color and oval in shape. It was silent and no motor noises could be heard.

Since the sight was unfamiliar to me, I looked directly overhead and saw an object which I examined for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. The object appeared to be tumbling or rotating slowly, with a bright area or "port hole" on the side facing me. Occasionally it would reflect the sun's rays in a bright flash.

I removed the glasses from my eyes to tell my son to go after the neighboring farmers to come and see the object, but shortly thereafter a smokey cloud cover of cumulus clouds came from the southwest and covered the object.

Visibility was unlimited prior to the clouds. The moon was visible but no stars were seen. Below the horizon.

The clear nights before and after this date, I observed the two objects with their reddish glow but no sound. They made a zig-zagging motion at times quite rapidly and silently. Their size was that of a pea held at arm's length.

I would be grateful if you would verify that this was an actual sighting so recorded in your files and advise me of any follow-up information you may have regarding this incident.

Sincerely,
