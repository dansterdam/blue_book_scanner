New Plymouth mystery object
The Plymouth Evening Post of 8th Jan 1962 carried an item about a strange object seen in the sky by several people in the New Plymouth area. The object was reported as being "a bright flickering light" and was observed for about an hour as it moved hither and thither in the sky. One observer is reported as saying the object was about a quarter the size of the full moon. The light would brighten and fade, sometimes disappearing and reappearing. After about an hour it suddenly blacked out and was not seen again. The observers had the impression of something controlled or intelligently directed. No other details given.
