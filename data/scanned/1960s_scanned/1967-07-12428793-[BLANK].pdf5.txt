facility, then our solar system should, on the average, be
visited only once every hundred thousand years.

If even a small fraction of the UFOs are interstellar space-
craft, this would imply an overriding significance to our small
planet. If our views on the frequency of intelligence in the
galaxy are correct, there is no reason for the earth to be singled
out for interstellar visits.

Dr. Charles Smiley, of Brown University, has recently undertaken
an interesting attempt to answer the question as to the possibility
of UFOs being from Mars or Venus. A logical approach to this
problem would be to consider favorable launch windows. It is well
known the importance of selecting a favorable launch time so that
a vehicle will travel along a minimum-energy orbit, arriving at the
path of Mars (or Venus) just as that planet comes to the same point,
and for each of these launching times there would be a corresponding
arrival time at intervals of about 584 days for Venus and about 780
days for Mars.

Dr. Smiley found that there was no evidence to indicate that
Martians and Venusians have been arriving in large numbers, if
at all. When one examines the direction from which the UFOs
arrived, we find not a single case of the UFO coming from the proper
direction to indicate that it had originated on Mars or Venus.
