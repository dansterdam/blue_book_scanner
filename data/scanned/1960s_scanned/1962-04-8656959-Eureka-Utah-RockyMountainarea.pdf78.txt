This investigation in accordance with AFR 200-2 is the result of a report of a UFO sighting in the Eureka, Utah area on 13 April 1962. This report was forwarded to Douglas Co., Colorado, and was assigned to the Colorado Division of the Project Blue Book, which would you give you some additional information.

On 13 April 1962 at approximately 4:41 pm, a Mr. and Mrs. Gordon L. Smith of 640 South 8th West, Eureka, Utah, stated they saw a very bright light or object in the sky to the south west. This object first appeared as a bright light and then the object itself. We were informed that at the time they first saw the object, the sun was shining brightly and the sky was clear. 

The object, according to their statement, was approximately 2 miles west of their location, was estimated to be about 20 to 30 feet in diameter, and was shaped like a disc or ellipse. The color was bright white or silver and the light was very intense, almost blinding. The object appeared to be hovering and was emitting a dim reddish glow. They watched the object for about 5 minutes and it then disappeared rather abruptly, in a downward motion. Mr. Smith stated that the object made no noise and left no trail.

The investigating officer could not account for the source of the light. The intensity and brilliance of the light was such that it could not be the sun or any known aircraft. Various aircraft flying in the vicinity were checked and eliminated as the source. The investigators could find no reasonable explanation for the sighting. They could not determine the nature, identity, or origin of the object. The case was classified as "unidentified".
