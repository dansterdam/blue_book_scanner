DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND SLOW DOWN?
DARK IS PARTS AND BRIGHT ONES?
GIVE OFF SMOKES?
CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?

Had just returned home with grandchildren, built a fire in the fireplace, children requested we turn off lights, which we did it was then they noticed the children's playthings that were piling up at one corner but then it became apparent they were too frequent and went in one direction.

WENT OUT OVER THE BAY. AS SOON AS IT DISAPPEARED, ANOTHER APPEARED, AND CONTINUED IN THE SAME PATH.

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
