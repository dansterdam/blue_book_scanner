Dear Mr. Hynek,

I hope you will give this matter your further consideration. I am quite concerned about this case and the report I made to your office. This sighting is, I believe, one of the most significant made in the Toledo area.

The field of view in the long series among an image of about 60Â° in horizontal angle. Picture No. 1 felis Arlington Avenue at an angle slightly upward from the ground. The second and third pictures were taken together with the material from the sighting.

I still felt the need was a real and the phenomenon is of great importance. I should be grateful if you would discuss this case further with me so that I may provide you with any additional information you may require. I hope to hear from you soon regarding this case.

Sincerely,
