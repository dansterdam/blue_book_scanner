The image appears to contain a compass or radar-like diagram at the top, along with two circular sketches or diagrams below. There is no human face visible in this image.

HE SKETCH SHOWN HERE IS AN IMPRESSION OF WHAT THE OBSERVER STATED HE SAW AT THE POSITION ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE APPROACHING. THIS IS PHYSICALLY SHOWN WITHOUT THE OBSERVER ACTUALLY SEEING THE OBJECT AT THE INDICATED POSITION ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH IT WAS HEADED.
