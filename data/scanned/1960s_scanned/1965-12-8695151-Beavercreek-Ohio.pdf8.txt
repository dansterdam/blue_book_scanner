The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

The text found in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 
    Day   Month   Year
        8      12     1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sightings.
        I saw what appeared to be a very bright and silver object move rapidly overhead accompanied by a pulsating reddish orange light. It moved in a very erratic manner, making abrupt turns and changes of speed. I was able to observe it for approximately two minutes before it disappeared behind some trees. The object appeared to be saucer shaped and emitted no sound. I have seen similar objects on two other occasions in this area that have displayed identical characteristics. I feel that this information is important and should be included in the record.
