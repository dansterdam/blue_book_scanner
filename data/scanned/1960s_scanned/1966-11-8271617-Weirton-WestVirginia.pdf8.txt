I had seen an unusual light in the sky which attracted my attention. At first I thought it might be an airplane with its lights on but it kept getting brighter and larger. It moved in a zig-zag fashion and seemed to be moving towards us. We all watched it for some time, estimating it to be about 7-10 miles away. There was a light that started off small and round and then became elongated. It seemed to be giving off a kind of shimmer or haze. At one point it seemed to light up an area around it. We were all very scared and afraid to go out and investigate as it was quite unnerving and unlike anything I had ever seen before. I stared to observe it through the window and it seemed to be pulsating or vibrating. Nothing like this had ever happened before and I couldn't explain what it was we were seeing, nor have I seen anything like it since. The object eventually seemed to move away in the distance and we lost sight of it.
