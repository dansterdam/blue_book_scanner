Reference the attached letter from Mrs. DE G., requesting information on her observation of an unidentified flying object on 11 August 1965. The following is a summary of the contents of that letter:

Dear Mrs. G.: 
Your letter to the Chief of Staff of the USAF has been forwarded to this office, the organization within the Air Force which handles reports of unidentified flying objects. 

The attached letter indicates the results of our investigation into this phenomena over the past 10 years. The information in your letter dated 23 August 1965 regarding your own observation of 11 August was not sufficient for a film or visual observation analysis. The details you have provided confirm the insufficient data and therefore we are unable to comment further and return it in the envelope provided.

FOR THE COMMANDER
ERIC T. de JONCKHEERE
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Aerospace and Subsystems
