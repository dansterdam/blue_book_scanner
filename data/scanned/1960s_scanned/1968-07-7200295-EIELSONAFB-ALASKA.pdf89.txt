SITUATION:
1. On the morning of 11 July 1968, a report of an unidentified object (UFO) was reported to the 547th Strategic Wing Combat Intelligence Division, Ab Strategic Wing, Eielson AFB.
2. Sighting reports:
(1) At approximately 1200Z hours 11 July 1968, Eielson AFB radar controller reported that object observed at 6 km altitude south of Eielson AFB. (See Item 3.)
(2) Eielson Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) was contacted by tower personnel and reported radar returns south of Eielson AFB.
(3) The 744 AGC Squadron at Murphy Dome, located 15 km w. of Eielson AFB, tracked an object and alerted Eielson for further sightings.
(4) Tower personnel requested that the 5th Strategic Wing alerted their personnel on the airfield to observe the phenomenon. As the aircraft were returning, the Captain said that nothing could be seen as dusk was falling. He said with the use of binoculars, no unusual phenomena was observed. His report does not confirm it's existence.

INVESTIGATION:
2. All personnel involved in the sightings were interviewed.
(1) No radar contact was made. 
(2) The altitude of site equipment (600m to 900m) would aligned with reports of unusual aircraft only due to ground clutter. As high as this is it seems incredible to those engaged.
(3) No warnings of hazards to flights such as balloon or bird migrations had been received.
(4) No known unusual weather phenomenon occurred at this time.
4. Area facilities were contacted for pertinent information on any unusual results.
