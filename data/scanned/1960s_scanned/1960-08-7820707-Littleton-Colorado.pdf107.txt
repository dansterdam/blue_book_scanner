Sighting 
[Redacted]
[Redacted] no change no change
The light appeared to move erratically and to change in size. The light would at times remain steady and at other times it would flicker or dim. It seemed to come and go in a somewhat irregular pattern. This behavior continued for an extended period of time. The light did not seem to be attached to any visible object. No other details are known.
