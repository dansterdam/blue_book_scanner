The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The image shows an old, handwritten page from what appears to be a Project Blue Book UFO report.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document:

21 April 66

Extensive military training in all probability the sighting. The crew flying a military aircraft. Very high speed, no sound, and flight path entirely unpredictable. No doubt in my mind other reports similar should be carefully investigated. The subject matter of national importance and should be treated accordingly.
