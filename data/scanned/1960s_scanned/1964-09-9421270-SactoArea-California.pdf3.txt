To the Commanding Officer,
Master Air Force Base,
Mather Field, Sacramento, Calif.

Dear Sir:

During the last 12 years the writer has had charge of a observatory at Sacramento City College in the course of our operations which deal largely with celestial objects.

Most of the reported sightings concern astronomical objects I have never had a phone call or a report from anyone who has seen a flying saucer except last Saturday afternoon a woman, unknown to me, phoned and stated that her son-in-law had seen some strange lights in the sky the previous night. As I was not present at the time I am unable to say what the nature of this sighting was.

I replied that we had a report of a brilliant meteor which had occurred on Thursday night. On Friday evening a woman called my residence stating that her son-in-law had reported this to me on Thursday evening for details on what her son-in-law had observed. I told her that the incident had been reported to me and that I had replied to him.

He told me that shortly after sundown on Thursday night he had observed quite a brilliant light descending in the Sierra Nevada mountains in a southeasterly direction. It descended below the horizon very rapidly. I mentioned that this was most likely a brilliant meteor which sometimes give this impression of descending on the horizon and then disappearing below. There was no evidence of any discolored sky or any maneuver which would indicate a flying saucer, he is rather impressed with what he saw and was quite excited about it. I was able to assure him that this was a natural phenomenon and not a flying saucer.

I hope this information is helpful to you. If I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to call upon me.

Sincerely yours,
Victor W. Killick
