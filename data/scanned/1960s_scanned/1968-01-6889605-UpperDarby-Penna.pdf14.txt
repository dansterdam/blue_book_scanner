Our sighting was not during the daytime. It was around 6:15 p.m. on January 27, 1958. Our family was on the way to our evening meal. As we were driving along Highway 320 near Lansdale, PA, a bright object came into view. It seemed to be hanging motionless in the sky off to the left of our car. As we watched it, the object began to move slowly across the sky in a straight line. It moved without any sound and seemed to be high in the sky. The object was saucer-shaped and much brighter than any star or planet. It appeared to be about the size of a half-dollar held at arm's length. The object remained in sight for about 2 to 3 minutes. When it disappeared, it did so rather quickly, almost as if it had been turned off. The sighting caused quite a bit of excitement in the car, as none of us had ever seen anything like it before. Although we discussed it afterwards, we did not report it to any authorities at the time.
