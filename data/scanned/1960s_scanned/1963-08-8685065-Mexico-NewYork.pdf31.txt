Landing on Wimbledon Common
From the Wandsworth Borough, London, on August 16, 1963, Mr. Bridge, a 28-year-old artist, says a police constable told him that he had seen a strange object land on Wimbledon Common, and that he would like to speak with the witness.

The constable said that the object rose from the common and then shot up and away at a terrific speed. The object was described as being disc-shaped and metallic-looking. It seemed to be about 20 feet in diameter. The witness was unable to walk for a short time after seeing the object, and described feeling numb.

The constable asked her what she was doing, and she replied that she had been painting and was just leaving when she saw the object land. She said she would be unable to paint for the rest of the day, as she felt sick and dizzy. The constable said that people who had seen the object flying over the common on the same morning had also complained of these effects.

Unfortunately, the address of the witness is not given, and she could not be located for further questioning. The police have no other information on this incident.
