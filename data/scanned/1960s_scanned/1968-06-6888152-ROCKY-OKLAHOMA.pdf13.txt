10. IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE PHENOMENOR, HOW MANY WERE THERE? DRAW A PICTURE TO SHOW HOW THEY WERE ARRANGED. (DID THIS ARRANGEMENT CHANGE DURING THE SIGHTING?)
11. SKY CONDITIONS (Check appropriate blocks.)
12. IF THE SIGHTING WAS AT TWILIGHT OR NIGHT, WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE STARS AND MOON?
13. IF THE SIGHTING WAS IN DAYLIGHT, WAS THE SUN VISIBLE? 
D. IF SIGHTING WAS IN DAYLIGHT, WAS THE SUN VISIBLE?
14. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENA, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT SEEMED TO BE SOLID OR TRANSPARENT, WHETHER THE EDGES WERE SHARP OR FUZZY, BECAUSE THE SHAPE INDICATES IF IT WAS CONVENTIONAL OR UNCONVENTIONAL OBJECT, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR FLAME, ETC.
This giant light seemed to hover and the edges were not sharp. The light was bright over a large area of the sky, so it didn't seem like a typical light source like a star or planet. The size and brightness suggest it was not a conventional object.
