Sir:

On Wednesday May 25 I observed something which I can only class as an unidentified flying object. Below given are the notes I made immediately after the sighting:

Place: Car-park in front of Sears & Roebuck Store, Mass. Ave., Cambridge.
Time: 19:43 hrs. [I checked my wrist-watch against WWV time signal at 20:11 hrs. after the sighting.]
Met: Condition: 5/10 cumulus, base est. 5,500' vertical development: visibility unlimited.
Appearance of object: Very thin ellipsoid as seen, major to minor diameter ratio approximately 3:1. Would estimate length of major axis 1/3 to 1/2 full-moon diameter but did not see moon out at the time so it is a memory comparison.
Altitude: Object definitely was above the cumulus. Object was white, indicating probably upper boundary, also I saw it disappear behind cloud. As base of cloud was definitely grey, were the object to have passed below the cloud it would have shown white against grey.
Course: Estimated ENE. [Position of north estimated from sun-wrist-watch combination, allowing 15Â° for correction from DST.] First seen overhead, for 1 sec, curved overhead.
Speed: Appeared equivalent to 200 mph at 1,000'. Estimating from a sun-different datum I should guess it at between 1000 to 3000 seconds of arc per second.
Time visible: Disappearing short periods when object appeared behind clouds I probably tracked it for 35 to 40 seconds. Course was directly toward the roof edge of the Sears store.
