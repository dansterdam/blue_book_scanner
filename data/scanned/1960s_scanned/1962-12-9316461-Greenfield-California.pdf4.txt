"The Air Pollution Control and Weather Bureau's Smog Forecast for the King City Area indicates that the visibility is 15 miles due to atmospheric haze and smoke, but otherwise is favorable for visual observations.

The sheriff's office in King City reports that the unidentified flying object first observed at approx 2000 hours tonight suddenly climbed rapidly and proceeded in a northerly direction. The pilot of a small private aircraft in the vicinity at the time also observed the object but was unable to make positive identification. The object was described as appearing silver or metallic in color and to have a flashing red light. Visibility was reduced by haze and smoke at the time and the object was lost from sight after a few minutes. No other information on the activity or origin of the object is available from the report.

The report from the sheriff's office in King City was transmitted to the 18th Air Division of the Air Defense Command of the United States Air Force, which has responsibility for air defense and investigation of unidentified flying objects in the area. The report indicates that no aircraft from any military or civilian source was in the area at the time that could have been responsible for the sighting. The incident is being investigated further by the Air Force."
