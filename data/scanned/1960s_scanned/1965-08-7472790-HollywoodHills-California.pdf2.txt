SEPT 5 1965

Your observation of 9 August 1965 is characteristic of many reports received by this office. The description of the object as a silvery, semi-transparent, cigar-shaped object which appeared to be approximately 30-40 feet long and 10-12 feet wide is typical of many such reports. The fact that it was observed to be revolving or spinning as it moved across the sky is also common to many UFO reports. The speed and altitude at which the object was observed is likewise within the ranges frequently reported.

While the object you observed may have been of an unusual nature, most such reports can be explained as misidentifications of known aerial objects or phenomena. Since we have no physical evidence or further information about the object you observed, we are unable to arrive at a definite conclusion as to its identity.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING
