27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the sky show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you lost sight of it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place on "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
