Dear ------

Your observation of floating visible plasma is an interesting sighting and is in line with the general characteristics of sightings of this nature.

Similar observations which have been reported on many occasions indicate unusual phenomena under certain conditions.

Your observations of circular, hovering, and several high-speed maneuvers from cloud origin and various luminous characteristics, correspond to other sightings during the latter part of the fall of 1953.

The Air Force appreciates your contribution to this program and will aid this unique observation to become part of the overall studies of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

EASTON M. JACIKS
