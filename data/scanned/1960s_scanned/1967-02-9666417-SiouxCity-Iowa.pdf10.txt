Dear Sir:

We have received some word from our photographic interpreters regarding the Sioux City, Iowa unidentified flying object photograph submitted by Mr. Edgar Hornis.

A letter from the Project Blue Book office will be coming to Sioux City within the next few days, and we know you will wish to know what will be contained in it.

The photographic analysis revealed that the image appears to be a slight double exposure of a street scene. It appears to be the camera. The camera focal length was a small setting, thus the object appears larger than if a longer focal length had been used.

The factors to verify the actual size of the object. The chief factors to consider are the scale of the object in relation to the known street scene elements and the quality of the image. The image was of poor quality, thus making precise measurement difficult.

It is indicated that there is no evidence in the photograph to substantiate the claim that an unidentified flying object was present. The photograph appears to be of a simple street scene double exposure.

If you wish any additional information, feel free to call.

Sincerely,

EARLS F. HANCE
Lt Colonel, USAF
