The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force investigation of UFO sightings.

Dear Sir:
I am writing this letter concerning a picture of a UFO. I know you have received a million letters like this, but I feel obligated to mail you a copy of this picture. I am a general science teacher at Fostoria High School and acquired this picture from one of my students. He said he took this picture of about 3pm like this on a clear day of August. If anyone information is needed just write to Fostoria High School Fostoria, Ohio.
