Mr. Ray Hixon, writing about what happened around 9:30 on the night of June 29. A friend said he saw some lights going over his house, and he went outside to look around, and as he looked into the sky, he saw this round object which was much larger than your average size plane. It was moving slowly and silently. He called the operator and asked her to get in touch with the sheriff's office and the Air Force, but the operator seemed to discount his story. The sheriff's office said they had no report of anything unusual. The Air Force was alerted, but they said they had no information on anything like that in the area. The object that he saw was about the size of a house, and he said it had a glow that seemed to change from yellow to orange to red. It was moving slowly east, then north before disappearing. He said it seemed to be responding to some controlling force, and that it was only about 600 to 800 feet up in the air. He was convinced that this was not a plane or anything conventional. He is a very reliable witness.
