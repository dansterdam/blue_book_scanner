the sketches you made of the object. After study I will return them to you.
Your report is appreciated and should be in the Memphis area so the report can be included in the Project Blue Book files as soon as possible. We can try to identify the object as one of the most modern installations of its type in the country, and it may have been the reason for an increase in sightings to this area.
Sincerely yours,
