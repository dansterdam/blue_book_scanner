SCORPION SHINES IN SOUTH

Along with Jupiter, the brightest obiect in the sky, a scorpion constellation will be visible in the southern skies and a partial eclipse of the sun will be visible in the region during July.

By JAMES STOKLEY

Along with Jupiter, the brightest object in the southern sky during the coming month of July, a scorpion constellation will be visible and, during the latter part of the month, a partial eclipse of the sun will be observed.

The scorpion, known to astronomers as Scorpius, is one of the most famous of the southern constellations. At this time of year, it is reaching its highest point in the sky during the evening hours. The scorpion's brightest star, Antares, will be conspicuous, glowing with a reddish hue.

On July 20, a partial eclipse of the sun will be visible over part of the Pacific Ocean. The moon will pass in front of the sun's disk, blocking out a portion of the solar surface. The eclipse will be total along a narrow path across the Pacific, but only a partial eclipse will be seen from land areas.

Saturn Low in Southeast

Low in the southeast sky, the planet Saturn also will be an interesting object of observation during July. It has just passed through opposition, the time when it is opposite the sun in the sky. This means that it rises about sunset and sets about sunrise, remaining visible throughout the night.

Saturn's rings are tilted toward the earth at the moment, making them more readily visible than at other times. This is because the earth is passing through the plane of Saturn's rings. As a result, the planet's disc appears slightly elongated.

At the same time, Saturn's north polar cap is turned toward the earth, allowing observers to see details on the planet's surface. The north polar cap appears as a bright white spot.

Saturn's brightness and the visibility of its rings and surface detail make it a fine telescopic object for examination during July.
