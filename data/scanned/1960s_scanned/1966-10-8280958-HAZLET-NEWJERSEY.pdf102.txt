Dear Gentlemen:

During the October month, I, [REDACTED] and my friend, [REDACTED], witnessed a series of UFO sightings.

One night approximately 9:30 p.m., we had seen a series of objects in the sky. It appeared to be about 8 to 10 in number and they were spread out in a line formation. An object, zoomed by above the school building, and then it disappeared. It had no blinking lights, and made no noise. When they passed over us, they did not appear to make any sound, and ran away rapidly.

In the month of October, was when we witnessed the many sightings. One night approximately 9:30 p.m., my friend and I saw a series of objects in the sky. They appeared to be approximately 150 to 200 feet above the neighbors house. We called attention to it and said, "do you think it is?" As soon as we brought attention to it, the objects increased in number, since we had noticed them. They started to move up and down, side to side, and going so fast as ran out to the back yard with Carol. When we got there, the objects were not seen.

Later that night, after my wife and gone home, I stood out the backyard with my two children. The little objects appeared again, approximately 150 to 200 feet above the ground. It did make any noise, and just hovered there. Suddenly, it did an amazing thing: it shot up in the sky with incredible speed. All through the night, we could see them, they were not advanced enough to have voice communication with them.
