(1) Unidentified Flying Object Report
A report of an unidentified flying object was provided the Base Clearance Section of the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron on 23 November 1960. A witness reported that he observed a bright object in the sky at approximately 7:35 PM on 23 November 1960. The object appeared to be about 75-100 feet in diameter. No details of shape or color were reported. The object was observed for approximately 30 minutes. No sound was heard. The object moved and hovered at various altitudes. At one point it was observed to ascend rapidly and then hover. All parties reported a bright object that first appeared in the east and maneuvered over their area, which is located near Roselle and Marshall, Illinois. The object was also to the east of Centralia, Illinois, as reported by Mr. [redacted].

The St. Louis Air Route Traffic Control Section indicated that they had no traffic in the area of the sightings at the time specified. The U.S. Weather Bureau was contacted, but they had no weather balloon activity in the area at the time of the sightings. The information has been recorded, but due to lack of specific details, i.e. shape, color, speed, etc., it is considered to be an insufficient report for analytical purposes according to JANAP 146. This information is being forwarded to the Commanding General, Air Defense Command, for any further action.
