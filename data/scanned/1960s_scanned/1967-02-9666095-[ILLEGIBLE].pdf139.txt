It seemed sincere in its story, after he told me of his sighting. He pointed out that it was witnessed by a U.F.O. Report group with him. This seemed the report he felt confident report he could make.

However it has gone public, so I don't give more details.
1. He believes an object.
2. Movement observed of certain amount seconds.
3. No evidence that it was U.F.O.
4. I still decline him to report.
