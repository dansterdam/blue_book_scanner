The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page describes various instructions and questions related to observing and reporting UFO sightings. For example, it asks the reader to imagine a scenario and place markers on a diagram to show the observed position and movement of a UFO. It also asks the reader to draw a picture that would show the motion of the observed object or objects.

Since there are no human faces or identities present in the image, I will proceed to transcribe the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. The object didn't change location - seemed about 1000 ft. above tallest building which is about 2 stories.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Only One
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
