Output of the text in the document:

On the evening T.V. program at about 8:30pm I saw an object which seemed to be about the size of a dime held at arms length.
At first I soon saw that this was no meteorite nor any other conventional type of aircraft. The object was stationary and hovered in the sky for about 30 minutes. After this, it suddenly shot upwards at an incredible speed and disappeared from sight. I watched it intently during the entire time, and was amazed at its performance.
I would guess that the object was at an altitude of around 2000 to 3000 feet. If it was some sort of natural phenomenon, it certainly was not anything I have ever seen before. I have enough evidence to feel that this was no normal aircraft, and I would like to know if your organization has any other reports of similar sightings in this area.
I hope this information is of some use to you. If there are any further questions, please feel free to contact me. The address is given below. I shall be glad to cooperate fully in any further investigation.
