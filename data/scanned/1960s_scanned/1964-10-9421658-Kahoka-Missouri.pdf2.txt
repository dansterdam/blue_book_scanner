OCTOBER 19, 1964

MR. J. EDGAR HOOVER 
WASHINGTON, D.C.

Dear Sir:

On the night of October 7, at 6:30 p.m. CST, I was driving northeast from Kahoka, Missouri, when I sighted and witnessed an unusual affair. The object I saw was quite large, very bright, and was traveling northwest at a very high rate of speed. It appeared to be twice as large as a usual aircraft light, and was reflecting a brilliant light (pulsating light) traveling from northeast to southwest. The object was well over 1000 feet high and was traveling about as fast as a jet fighter.
Just as I was nearing my home, the object suddenly became dark, and the sky was no less lit. This was no balloon or shooting star. I was home by 7:00 p.m. and there was no moon, and the sky was clear. I hope this information will be of help to you.

The next day I went to our nearest airport, and discussed this case with the switchboard operator, and all of their employees had seen the object too. One man in the tower said that no planes were up at that time on the river. I do not, however, believe that any planes were up there, and this object was faster than any plane or jet that I have ever seen. The sky looked funnel-shaped, and there, and once the object became dark, the sky looked normal.

If there seems as though there should be some logical explanation, but if there is one, it seems awfully powerful enough to cast such a strong light as to be reflected back in that manner. I would appreciate your looking into this case and letting me know what you find. I hope I have not bothered you for nothing, but I would like to know what this object was, if possible.

Yours truly,

/s/ J. E.
