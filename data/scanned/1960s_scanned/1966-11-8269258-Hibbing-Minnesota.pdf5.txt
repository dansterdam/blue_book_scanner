Dear Sir:

My brother & I to something funny. Sunday night we were on a road in the Staples Lake. It was a clear, moonless night with few stars. We came to the top of the hill and noticed something hovering over an old farm about a quarter mile off the road. It was shaped like a bright star. We drove closer to get a better look and it seemed to grow larger and brighter. Don't know what it was, because it disappeared at high speed. We travel a lot but have never seen anything like this before. Don't you wish you could look into the matter? Guess it was just someone playing tricks with a spotlight or something. However, you never know about these things.
