The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a letter from David R. Stull, the Civilian Information Officer, to an unidentified recipient, regarding a report of an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation.

Dear Sir,
This will reply to your letter of March 1, 1968, in which you described an unidentified flying object (UFO) that you observed. 
Thank you for reporting this observation. However, as you will realize, the observed object does not fall into the technical or physical realm; your technical analysis, therefore, will be able to investigate the matter further.
Thank you for your interest. Please report it as a "good" UFO which I can further investigate.
Sincerely,
David R. Stull
Lt. Colonel, USAF (Ret)
Civilian Information Officer
Office of Information
