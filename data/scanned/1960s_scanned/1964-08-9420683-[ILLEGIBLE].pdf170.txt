The image contains a diagram or sketch, but no photograph. The diagram appears to be illustrating instructions for a UFO sighting report, including directions for drawing the motion and orientation of an observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "x" on the line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Please use the scale given to show how high the object was above the horizon.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion of the object or objects you saw. Use a "v" to show the end of path and show any changes in direction.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
