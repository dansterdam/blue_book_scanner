TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

"Occurred on September 7, 1966 in Niagara Falls, New York. At approximately 2200 hours, Mrs. Ella Parman, age 61, was sitting on her porch and observed two strange objects hovering over the Niagara River. The objects were described as round in shape, about 20-30 feet in diameter, and were reddish-orange in color. Mrs. Parman stated that the objects appeared to be about 500-600 feet above the river and were completely silent. The objects maneuvered around for about 10 minutes, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight.
