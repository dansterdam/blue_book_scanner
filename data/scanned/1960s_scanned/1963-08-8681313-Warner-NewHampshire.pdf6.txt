The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, with a series of questions and answer spaces.

Project Blue Book Page Text:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "Y" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
(Here the witness has provided a hand-drawn sketch showing the path of the observed object.)

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
(The witness has provided a written response, but no specific details are given.)

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object would have been covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
(No response provided.)

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
(The witness has provided a written response, but no further details are given.)

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
(No response provided.)
