There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

As per your request, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

and apparently its red light, it continued to eastward. We were about 37 miles northeast of Midland, Michigan, and were driving on highway M-20 at the time. The object appeared to be about 1500 feet up and traveling at a high rate of speed, it never stopped or slowed down, it continued on and made no sound whatsoever. 

We finally clocked the time.

8:05 p.m. cst on our action. We are another 3 minutes of the object's sighting. So the first 3 minutes we were trying to decide if what we saw was real. It disappeared from sight as we lost it across the horizon.

8:25 p.m.
