1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) report from Groveton, Missouri, which occurred on 9 February 1963.

3. The objects appear to be red in color and also seem to be moving at a high rate of speed, approximately 1,200 to 1,500 miles per hour, as estimated by reliable witnesses on the ground.
4. If you have any helicopters in your area that could be operating in the Groveton, Missouri, vicinity at the time in question, please advise us at once, as there may have been some activity in the area at that time.
5. To obtain this data, it is realized, you must do quite a bit of research. However, we would sincerely appreciate your answering these questions.
