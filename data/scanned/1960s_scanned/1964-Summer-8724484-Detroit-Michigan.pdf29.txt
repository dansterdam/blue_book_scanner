The text describes an incident that occurred on 12th June, 1964 in front of several witnesses. The object observed was described as saucer-shaped and about 40 degrees above the horizon. It was brightly lit and seemed to be supported by a tower, but a couple of minutes later it moved off in an easterly direction.
