Gentlemen:

I am not a believer in flying saucers, as it is well known in the intelligence program, of which I am a part. I am told it is either a flying jelly fish or refraction of the sun and since it is a complete mystery as why, nothing can be done about it. As for me, I like the flying jelly fish attraction.

I mentioned it was taken about the first of the year by my four year old boy.

Sincerely yours,
Joseph Jones

P.S. Could be lentils, as on dimmed lamps?
