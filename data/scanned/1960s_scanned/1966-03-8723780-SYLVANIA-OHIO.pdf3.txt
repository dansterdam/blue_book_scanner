Dear Sirs:

On the month of March, I witnessed what I know was a UFO. I took pictures of this strange object and had them developed.
After seeing this strange object a read in the paper all the other stories so I did a paper and I'm still trying to gather information on this subject.

Through all my studies I read that you were the center of all the information gathered. Also through my research I read a article that you sometimes send a copy of Bluebook. I was wondering if you would send me a copy along with any other information that you can. I would appreciate it.

Sincerely yours,
