The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, with a form-style layout and various questions and fields for the witness to fill out.

Here is the text I was able to extract from the document:

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before. If so give date or dates and location.
EVER THAT SIMILAR THE OBJECT SIGHTED.

31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One) Yes No
31.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One) Yes No
31.2 Please list their names and addresses:
