27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the sky high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the horizon where you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Only 1. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
