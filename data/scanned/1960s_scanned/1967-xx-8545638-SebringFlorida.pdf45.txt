SIGHTED ACCOUNT:
The three witnesses were proceeding north on Route 7 at about 12:15 AM. Upon reaching the South Williamstown area they spotted a bright flash on the sky. (This was also seen by a Mr. ********* at his home in North Adams Adams and Williamstown.) Subsequent to the flash, they noticed a power blackout affecting North Adams, Adams and Williamstown.

Guessing that this was related to the glow in the field to their right (west) of the road and approximately 1/4 mile away. Reaching the glow, they discovered a circular object, approximately 50 feet in diameter, off the ground and hovering approximately 3 feet above. The object appeared to be a bright reddish orange in color and dome-shaped, with a white dome on top. It was estimated to be 35-40 feet high. The object had a red light on the top which spun rapidly, and another white light on the bottom that seemed to be rotating at a slower speed. Trees on the other side of the frozen stream on which the object was hovering, appeared to be bending away from the object as if pushed by a strong wind. The object suddenly dimmed and shot away in an upward direction at a high rate of speed, disappearing from sight. The witnesses then resumed their journey and continued on the route. Subsequent to this, evidence was found of damaged power lines and burned poles, and the citizens of the three towns were without power for two hours. The witnesses stated that the object and noted that the sight was still "very bright". Suddenly, a very bright light seemed to come from the rear of the object which obscured the entire area, then the object shot up and right of the road and passed the car which was doing 60 mph. The object then disappeared.
