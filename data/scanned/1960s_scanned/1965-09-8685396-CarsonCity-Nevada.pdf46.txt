Sighting near Antwerp

R. Verstraeten, Boechout, near Antwerp, Belgium, age 17, observed a luminous object on 22 April 1965, from 8:40 to 10:05 p.m. He and his family were in the garden, when they noticed a bright light in the sky about 15 degrees above the horizon, in the south-south-east direction. It was oval-shaped, surrounded by a bluish halo, and seemed somewhat larger than a star. The object remained stationary for about 5 minutes, then started moving in a straight line. As it moved, it changed color from bluish-white to reddish-orange, and back again. Its speed was estimated to have varied between 800 and 1,000 mph. At times it appeared to be accompanied by smaller lights, and it seemed to be surrounded by a cloud or mist. After about 15 minutes, it disappeared below the horizon.
