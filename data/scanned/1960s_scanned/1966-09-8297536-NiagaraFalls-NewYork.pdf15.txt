About this time about 8:30 PM Sept 9th 1966 a bright light was visible in the sky which was very bright and visible all through the drive. Said the 1966 Oldsmobile used by house Sept 10th and 11th Saturday night and Sunday morning a girl observed the bright light with out of my house. She I returned to may find and told my clerk the details the many. She had noticed the bright light in the 1:46 am on 9/10/66
High as at the 31/2 miles town is apparent to be a distant in may fly. went my home. These objects appering close together, in the sunlight position I could plainly see this curious shape which moved away my home. As the distance became less it seemed to position a pattern high & bright lights would appear to descend then ascend and this sequence seemed to be repeated many times. About 1:30 am I saw this strange object again and it seemed now to have increased greatly in size. It did not remain stationary but moved in the sky. I gathered from what I saw that this object although seemingly a considerable distance away, was of immense size. The about 1:30 am I heard outside the park railing & viewing this strange object again. It seemed now to have greatly increased in size. It did not remain stationary but moved in the sky. I gathered from what I saw that this object although seemingly a considerable distance away, was of immense size.
