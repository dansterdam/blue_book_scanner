Dear Sir:

Three children saw a flying saucer or what they thought was a flying saucer on Monday, October 21, 1964. On Thursday, October 22, another boy and I saw it and I would like to know if it is a common occurrence at this time and if so, would you please give me any information pertaining to it.

I have been studying rockets and aircraft. So when I heard about the saucer, I started looking for it, and I found it. I will be happy for any information pertaining to this thing.

Sincerely,
