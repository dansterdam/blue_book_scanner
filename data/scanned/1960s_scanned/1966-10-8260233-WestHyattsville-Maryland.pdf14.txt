Air Force identifies 10 UFOs
The Air Force has identified 10 unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over West Hyattsville, Maryland on 10-8-66. 
The objects were first reported and seen from the vicinity of the Washington, D.C., area at 8:40 p.m. and disappeared at 10:25 p.m. the same night. They were described as round, reddish-orange in color, and some were stationary, others in motion. The objects had no red, green, or white running lights. They were observed by several persons, including officers from the Maryland National Guard. The objects were tracked on radar at Ft. Belvoir, Va.
The Air Force determined the objects were balloons, and were weather balloons launched from the Chesapeake Bay area. The balloons were reflective and caught the evening sunlight, causing the reddish-orange glow.
