MEMO FOR THE RECORD
10 November 1965
Mr. and Mrs. West Middletown called to report a UFO. This thing appeared to be a large round ball. It was about the size of a grapefruit in comparison to a star. It was in the Northeast, and the lights were going on and off. There were long colored sparks shooting from the object. As it got closer, it appeared to be a night light with red and white and bluish lights. It seemed to land. It had very bright lights that went on and off very fast. The object seemed to go into a point. It had long thin wings. It appeared as though it might have had a bubble on the front. It landed to the left of the levee and had a dull deep large round red glow. Took off to the northwest. It was less than five minutes on the ground. It took it less than 2 minutes to disappear. Next day she heard a report from a lady in West Alexandria which is near Gratis. At
