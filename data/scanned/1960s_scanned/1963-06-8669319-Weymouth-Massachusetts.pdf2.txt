The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

The text in the document states:

stretch across a field in back of their house, until it disappeared from view. "However, (Mrs. "X") was so shaken she could not get to sleep," he said. "We talked about it until 4:30 A.M.".

Mrs. "X" called the Naval Air Station around 8:30 A.M. and someone there took her name and telephone number saying they would call her later, but no call came. Both Mr. and Mrs. "X" distinctly asked their neighbors if they had heard a sound during the night. The three neighbors they asked all had heard a loud sound but did not get out of bed to look as they had dismissed it as a low-flying jet.

At first the "X's" were reluctant to tell anyone what they had seen. Later, after the Patriot Ledger, a local Quincy newspaper, published a photo taken by one of its reporters of a UFO in the sky that same night (July 25th) along with reports of visual sightings of a UFO, the "Gilbert's" told their story to the Patriot Ledger (See photostat of news-clipping attached to data sheet).

The "Gilbert's" said they had no idea what the object could have been but were certain it was not an airplane or a helicopter. Both families (The "Gilbert's" and the "X's") were sincere and my brother and I were convinced that they had seen and/or heard what they had described - an Unidentified Flying Object.
