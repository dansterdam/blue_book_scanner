July 13
This report refers to a call that I received in about 5:00 A.M. A witness shot what appeared to be a bright light and went back to bed. The witness claimed that the object was round and bright and stayed in the same spot for quite some time. The witness was uncertain if it was a star, planet, or aircraft. The object was also reported to have made a slight movement around 5:15 A.M. The object was observed from 4:00 A.M. - 5:00 A.M. It had been seen, but looked stagnant at first. It would appear as a bright light and then become dull, and then bright again, suggesting some kind of pulsing. The witness felt that something was not quite normal about the object.
I would appreciate an analysis to determine what the witness actually observed. This report is written at 5:00 A.M.
