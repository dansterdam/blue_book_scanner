The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, specifically a report dated March 8, 1966 regarding an incident in Houston, Texas.

Analysis of Australian UFO Photographs

HQ USAF (SAFOIR)

1. Photo analysis has been accomplished on the attached photographs. Possible identification or description of the UFO's has not been possible from the negatives. However, there are several comments which may prove relevant to the analysis:

a. The image does not appear to be the result of any processing effect.
b. It appears that the shutter speed used was considerably longer than the stated 1/500 second. The distance covered by the vehicles during the time of exposure, as indicated by their light trails, is much too great for a 1/500 second exposure. Speed calculations for the vehicles were made using a distance of 50 feet between light poles. Had more exposures been available and had the image been clearly defined, a rate of movement could probably have been derived.
c. It is noted that there is no reflection of the bright image on the water although it was stated to be only 20 feet above the water. The reflection of the street lights are evident. It is possible that some obstruction in the foreground could have blocked the view of the image.
d. No measurements are possible due to the halo of the bright image.  

2. Since there is no indication of threat to the security of the United States or of danger to our photographic investigation, the photos are not in the best interest of the Department. Therefore, no further attempt will be made to evaluate the cause of the image on the attached photographs.
