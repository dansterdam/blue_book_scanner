Dear Mr. _____,

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without essential information, such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, or weather information, we are unable to undertake a scientific investigation. And you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
