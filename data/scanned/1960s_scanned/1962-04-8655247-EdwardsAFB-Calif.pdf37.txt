Four Commands Cited
For Savings Program
As 'Money Tree' Ends
The "Money Tree" savings program at
Hq. Air Force Logistics Command and
Hq. Supply Air Force was ended July 13 by Gen. Orme L.
Wilson Jr., AFLC commander. Gen. Wilson said the program
had produced savings of $13 million in a year, adding "That's a
pretty good crop - and what I call a real 'Money Tree.'" 
Maj. Gen. Mark E. Bradley was awarded the Dis-
tinguished Serrice Medal for his efforts in devising and
administering the 'Money Tree' program at AFLC. The
certificate cites his "outstanding performance in conceiving and
implementing an Air Force maintenance and supply management
plan designated as the 'Money Tree.'"
The Strategic Air Command, Air De-
fense Command, Air Training Command and the Military Air
Transport Service were also cited for their economies and cost-
saving efforts.
The net savings to the Air Force
from the "Money Tree" program was over $13 million in the first
fiscal year it was in operation. This was a major factor in the
Air Force being able to absorb an unbudgeted increase of 7,700
personnel authorized July 1, 1961 without requesting additional
funds.
While the immediate savings were
dramatic in relieving the strain on the Air Force budget, the
far-reaching effects are considered of equal if not greater
importance. These include improved work simplification,
increased efficiency, and simplification of procedures.
The concepts and techniques of the
"Money Tree" program are applicable to all areas of Government
operation. A similar project put into effect by the Department
of Defense is the "Management Incentive Program" which was
instituted to grant cash management improvement awards.

Air Force Commandos
To Help Train Allies
An aerial training program under way at Hurlburt
Field, Fla., for the Air Force special air warfare
center, is training foreign military personnel in techniques
peculiar to the counterinsurgency role of the Air
Force. The Commandos are not designed actively to
engace the enemy but to train foreign allied air forces
in basic air combat, transportation, logistics and related
techniques of special counterinsurgency warfare essential
to low level group and surprise air
support missions and civic action programs.
All foreign military personnel and air
commandos are alike. The goal is to form
highly integrated and flexible
air-ground teams capable of operations ranging
from large scale campaigns to small
strike-team actions. The Air Force commandos will help
train counterparts of foreign allied forces in special
counterinsurgency warfare.
