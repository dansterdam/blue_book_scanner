Dear Colonel Manatt:

Last evening I saw what I can only call an unidentified flying object about 9:25 P.M. My brother witnessed the object also.

Enclosed is a chart showing the south end of Long Beach Island and Little Egg Harbor Bay. On the chart I have indicated approximately where we first sighted the object over the bay in the northwest, the easterly course it took and disappearance.

The sky above and in the northwest was cloudy to high, dark clouds. The object appeared suddenly in the northwest, gliding in, approximately a mile and a half or so over the bay. Using a landmark, it suddenly appeared over Shelter Island, the object was brilliant and looked like a golf ball and moved like a falling leaf, both high and low and one can see their fore and aft and either be both part of or scattered lights. However, we could not see any of these lights on the object.

I looked through the binoculars and saw the object quite, in fact, very clear. It then seemed to ascend gradually and then disappear, and all we could see was a bright bluish glow over it, which was not nearly as brilliant and which was the shape of the object only silhouetted. We watched very closely but the object seemed to be withdrawn.

The next morning I called the Coast Guard in Beach Haven, the State Police and the Cape May Beach Beach Island Board of Trade about it. I added about it.

Please do let me know if you can ascertain the identification of the object we saw. Thank you.

Sincerely yours,

P.S. At the time we saw the abovementioned object, the wind was blowing from the southwest, which I checked out with the Coast Guard log.
