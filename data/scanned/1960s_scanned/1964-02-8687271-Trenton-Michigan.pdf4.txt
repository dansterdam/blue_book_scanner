The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the top right corner of the document. The sketch appears to be a side-profile view of a saucer-shaped object.

Dear Sir(s),
At 2:15 and 3:00 pm we witnessed unidentified objects in the air. There were three objects flying from northwest to southeast, and at 3:04 two objects came from southwest. The objects were moving at a variable speed and traversing the clouds at a variable way. It was difficult to determine the size, but a telescoping lens is called a constant lens. The latest theory is a missile from the clouds.

Yours truly,
