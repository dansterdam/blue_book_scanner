UAO Over Canberra Airport
On the 13th of July, a crew of a USAF transport plane carried the following report to APRO:
On take-off from Canberra airport, the crew sighted a large, bright, glowing object which hovered near Canberra airport while the U.S. Marine aircraft was in the air.
The initial story said that the object "has battled experts in Canberra." The object was spotted by air traffic control officers and other ground aircraft observers on the field. Six members of the traffic control tower told the press that the object was "suspended" at about 5,000 feet for 40 minutes and that when the sun glinted on it, it became prefectly visible. A USAF plane was sent out to identify it. 
In the initial press story, experts were quoted as saying that if it was evidence, it could not be identified. The station, the report said, had unusual difficulty in locking on to the object by radar at the time.
