NEW YORK CITY
Thousands of people across the northeastern U.S. were dazzled last week by a spectacularly bright object—which most authorities described as a meteor—seen at sunset along a 1,000-mile path from the Carolinas to Canada. In New York 19-year-old William Copeland, a college freshman and an amateur photographer, was prowling along the Brooklyn waterfront and caught the luminous meteor plummeting toward earth, its silvery trail etched against the orange sky over lower Manhattan.
