The image in the document contains a handwritten text, as well as a sketch or drawing that appears to be a silhouetted or blurred outline of some kind of object or shape. The text appears to be a description or report, but does not contain any identifiable humans.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the output of all the text found in the document:

First account
(monitory)
as to what I saw on the early morning of 7 Aug 1967
I was on patrol in the vicinity of Dayton, Ohio when I observed a dark, strange shaped object in the sky. It appeared to be hovering and made no sound. It was approximately 50-75 feet in length and 20-30 feet wide. The object was elongated in shape, with a somewhat serrated or jagged edge. After approximately 3-4 minutes of observation, the object suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed, and in less than a second was out of sight.
