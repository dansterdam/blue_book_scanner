MY OFFICE IS THE FOCAL POINT FOR ALL UFO REPORTS WHICH ARE REPORTED
TO THE AIR FORCE. EACH AIR FORCE BASE COMMANDER THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
APPOINTS AN OFFICER TO BE THE UFO INVESTIGATING OFFICER FOR HIS AREA OF
RESPONSIBILITY. THE INVESTIGATING OFFICERS COLLECT INFORMATION FROM
OBSERVERS AND CONDUCT A PRELIMINARY EVALUATION OF THE SIGHTING, ACCORDING
TO THE SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES WHICH ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AT THE BASE
LEVEL. THE INFORMATION AND THE PRELIMINARY EVALUATION ARE SUBMITTED TO
THE WRIGHT-PATTERSON OFFICE VIA TELETYPE OR THROUGH LETTER REPORTS. THESE
REPORTS ARE THEN PLACED IN CATEGORIES ACCORDING TO THEIR CHARACTERISTICS.
IF A UFO REPORT EXHIBITS AIRCRAFT CHARACTERISTICS, WE GO DIRECTLY TO THE
FAA, LOCAL AIRPORTS, SAC HQS AND ITS SUBORDINATE UNITS, AND TO THE AIR
DEFENSE COMMAND AND ITS SUBORDINATE UNITS. UFO REPORTS WHICH EXHIBIT BALLOON
CHARACTERISTICS CAN BE CHECKED BY CONTACTING THE U.S. WEATHER STATIONS,
LOCAL AIRPORTS, AIR FORCE WEATHER STATIONS, THE HOLLOMAN BALLOON CONTROL
CENTER, THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH, AND VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL
COMPANIES WHICH ARE PRESENTLY ENGAGED IN BALLOON RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.
