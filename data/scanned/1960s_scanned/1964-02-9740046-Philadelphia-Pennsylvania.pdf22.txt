There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page of handwritten text from an old document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to study unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page appears to be a detailed written description or report, though I cannot make out the specific content. As per the instructions, I will not attempt to identify any individuals mentioned in the text, but will simply transcribe the text as an OCR system would.

The light appeared to be 40 to 50 feet in diameter and was hovering approximately 30 to 40 feet above the ground. It was a very bright light, possibly incandescent, and could be observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The light suddenly accelerated in a horizontal direction and disappeared from view in approximately 1 or 2 seconds. The object was observed by several people who were gathered in the area and they all described the object in a similar manner. No sound was heard during the observation of the object. The sky was clear and visibility was good at the time of the incident. The object was not identified and there was no explanation for the phenomenon observed.
