The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document with handwritten text.

In closing I would like to give my interpretation of what this could have been.
This would appear to be a spacecraft, approximately 100 ft. long x 20 ft. in diameter with flat ends. From the apparent individual actions of the lesser objects it would seem to be some kind of homing (?) and/or maneuvering device launched from above.
If we can be of further service please contact us.

My wife's name is REDACTED. Age 44.
We reside at REDACTED Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53209.
We are both in good health, both have good vision, and for the purpose of the sightings our naked eyes served very well.
