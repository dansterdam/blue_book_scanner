"Forest city area. South. 32 year 
Mr. Wright under the other man.
The report on what was observed is most credible, but it cannot be told very much about the sighting, as we have about 5 minutes. Now - I am sure this is to make a complete report with you, very shortly. I am writing to ask you what can be done? If you will use discretion on this matter, please, as I am trusting to cover up this entire matter. AND PLEASE DON'T say it was a plasma or something or such formulation, PLEASE DONT say anything so stupid! All this stuff is true, remember I told you in what all this is about? UFOs are real, they are crazy. Personally, I think they are probably smarter than we usually possibly guess. Thank you for reading this, as I must restrict this, as you readily know."
