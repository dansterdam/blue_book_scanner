10. CONCLUSION
Astronomical - (T-1209) SATELLITE DECAY

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observed a light object which reached an intensity slightly greater than the brightest star in the sky. The light was visible at that time. Believed to be 3-5 miles above the horizon, and 10% of the Equatorial diameter. The duration of the trail was 30 minutes while the object itself was observed for 30 seconds. The trail appeared to stream upward (might be trailing visible for 30). 

DETAILS: Four portions of Canon 57 break-up centered during this period. However this object reportedly turned out to be a satellite already evaluated as a re-entering meteorite or Satellite Decay, and the unusual feature of trail is not otherwise identified.
