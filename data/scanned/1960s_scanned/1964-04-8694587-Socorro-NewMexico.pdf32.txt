There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing an investigation into a UFO sighting that occurred in Socorro, New Mexico in 1964.

An inspection of the scene Saturday morning showed the object had landed astride a narrow, rock-strewn draw with the officers earlier had circled with stones the four places where the legs of the object had touched. The object was about a foot long by six inches wide. They did not appear to have been made by an object striking the earth with a tremendous weight or considerable velocity, but by an object of considerable weight setting down lightly. The two legs of the object that Zamora saw probably were about 2.5 feet long.
It was about 12 feet from one impression on the west side and 13 feet between the two on the east side. The width was probably nine or more feet. The clumps of green grass and two greasewood bushes seemed to have been crushed all at once by an extremely hot flame. There were fragments of green branches on one greasewood branch and on the two crushed depressions were four and five inches in diameter, respectively. The cause of the landing of the object, like its identity and its source, remains unanswered. As no further evidence was found, after Capt. Holder was apprised of the UFO occurrence, he made a report of it to the proper agencies at WSAM. Investigation of the incident will be conducted by it and by designated government agencies.
