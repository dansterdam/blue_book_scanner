WESTERN SIGHTINGS
Spring '64 Play
Several sightings which took place in the west during the Spring of 1964 UFO activity, were crowded out of fall bulletins by more detailed accounts of other incidents. We take this opportunity to list these incidents with pertinent details:

MRS. G. L. KRIGER, of S. New Mexico, Highway 10, Tularosa, reported to authorities and the Albuquerque Tribune that she and New Mexico reported speedy mystery objects. Mrs. J. M. Watkins of Sumner, New Mexico, told a reporter that she saw 2 cylindrical-shaped objects with fins flying at about 300 feet altitude. They appeared to be about 50 feet long. A neighbor also observed the objects.

A similar report came from a Mancos, Colorado man who said he saw two objects (description correlates with object seen by Mrs. Watkins) flying in the Estes Vedas National Park. Same date.

Later in the afternoon a report was made to the Federal Aviation Agency at Farmington, New Mexico of a cylindrical object sighted near there, and another made at Farmington a short time later said the object appeared to be "tumbling in the air" as it flew at low altitude.

Two Albuquerque men who refused to identify themselves in print watched the Albuquerque Tribune that they watched a small, flat-bottomed egg-shaped object for about 5 minutes through binoculars on 11 May. It was metallic appearing, noiseless and flew near the base of the Manzano Mountains. They first thought the object was a jet but it was flying too slow. It disappeared after 3 or 4 minutes, then a jet flew over. They had no trouble identifying the jet and said the object definitely was not a conventional aircraft. This area, incidentally, is a highly sensitive classified military area.
