11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observed a bright blue colored object in the eastern sky. The object was much brighter than the brightest star. The object dimmed and brightened. It appeared to be a star but the color was a definite blue. Object did, Jupiter was rising in the east and with a stellar magnitude as bright as the bright object in the eastern sky. The star Sirius was also rising in the southeastern sky, but the description of the object is more consistent with that of a sighting of the planet Jupiter.
