Dear Allen,

Reference the attached unidentified object report from Miss ??, a copy of which is the young lady seems in order.

With the description of the motion of the three objects, it appears that some sort of mirage was the most likely cause. The negatives of the photos could not be evaluated, no photo analysis.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF 
Chief, Aerial Phenomena
