PAGE THREE PJWZND AS
INDIA NO ACTION TAKEN. HILO ALL DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN BY THE FOUR
OBSERVERS WERE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME EXCEPT FOR LENGTH
OF OBSERVATION. THE BEST DESCRIPTION WAS MADE BY A CIVILIAN CONTROL
TOWER OPERATOR WHO SAID IT ACTED MUCH LIKE A METEOR, EXCEPT IT
WAS THE BRIGHTEST ONE HE HAD EVER SEEN. HE ESTIMATED HAVING SEEN
APPROXIMATELY TEN TO FIFTEEN METEORS OR "FALLING STARS" IN THE LAS
VEGAS NIGHTS. HOWEVER, HE WOULD NOT SAY THAT THIS OBJECT WAS
ASTRONOMICAL. HE STATED FURTHER THAT SAY'I TAKE CENTER MAP
RECEIVED SEVERAL AIRBORNE REPORTS OF THIS SAME OBJECT WITH AT
LEAST ONE OBSERVATION AS FAR NORTH AS WENDOVER UTAH. THE OBJECT
IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN A LARGE METEOR, HOWEVER, WE WERE UNABLE
TO CONFIRM THIS WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE LOWELL OBSERVATORY AT
FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA, WHO REPORTED THEY HAD GROUP COVER AT THE
TIME AND HAD MADE NO OBSERVATIONS. I IYA. NONE
