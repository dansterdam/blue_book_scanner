The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text.

The object was sighted by 
many all came away with the 
same impression. It was round
and very flat. It has a bright
pattern of flashing lights which
traveled in a zig-zag pattern as
it passed at a great rate of
speed. I think this occurred
around 9:30 PM. The people were
excited and alarmed over this
unusual sight. It would glimmer
with an intensity and then it
would almost vanish from sight.
This is a short description of
what they all saw. They were
convinced that this was no
known type of aircraft. This
was a puzzling and frightening
experience to all who witnessed
it.
