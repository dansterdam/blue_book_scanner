Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your recent letter in which you expressed a curiosity over your sighting of Echo I which appeared at 9:13 p.m. on that evening in the south, about the horizon, moving southwesterly.

Enclosed is a summary of information on Project BLUE BOOK, the official U.S. Air Force investigation of UFO sightings and reports. This brochure will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,
