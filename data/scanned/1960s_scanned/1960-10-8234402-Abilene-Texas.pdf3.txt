Dear Sirs:

At 0:10, or possibly a minute or two later, O.C.T., this morning, I was sighting my telescope on the great double-star Albireos, when I happened to glance up casually through the open dome in that immediate area. The object appeared to be of a bright red hue and seemed to have crossed the milky way about halfway between the Cygnus and Cassiopeia constellations. It was traveling in a straight line, but its motion was peculiar in that the object appeared to be rocking or swaying from side to side as it traveled, rather rapidly, across the sky. The great nebula of Andromeda, a little south of the Milky Way, was my visual reference.

It took my eyes away from it and could never find it again. Its course could not have been very close to the earth, to be able to see it, possibly just a little to the south of it.

When I first observed it, I thought that it was an air plane flying at an altitude great enough to be seen through my telescope. But when I lowered my eye to look for the airplane, I could not find any airplane flying at that point, though I searched the sky carefully. And the motion was peculiar enough not to make me think it was an airplane in the first place.

Sincerely yours,
G.G. - McDonald Observatory
