The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an old typed document on the letterhead of Universite Laval in Quebec, Canada.

UNIVERSITE LAVAL
FACULTE DE PHILOSOPHIE
Quebec, Canada.

A SHOOTING STAR AND A SPECK OF REFLECTION FROM MY GLASSES THAT MAY SOMETIMES BE CAUSED BY A SUDDEN MOVEMENT OF MY HEAD- WHICH MOVEMENT I DID NOT MAKE IN THIS CASE. 

I AM VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN PHOTOGRAPHY AND I MUST SAY THAT, DESPITE MY MYOPIA, I HAVE A VERY KEEN EYE FOR NATURAL PHENOMENA.

I AM A TEACHER OF PHILOSOPHY AND ALSO THE OF PHILOSOPHY OF LAVAL UNIVERSITY.

YOURS TRULY,

[Redacted]
QUEBEC, QUEBEC
CANADA.

P.S.: I EXPERIENCED NO SHOCK FROM THE SIGHTING, ONLY WONDER. I AM IN A CURIOUS SITUATION BECAUSE I TEND TO BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT UFO'S AND WAS PROMPTED TO WRITE YOU BY THE READING OF THE RECENT ISSUE OF LOOK ON UFO'S.
