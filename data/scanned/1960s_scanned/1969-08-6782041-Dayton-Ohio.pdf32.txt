The image does not contain any photograph or visual content. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing a detailed questionnaire filled out by a witness.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

DO YOU USUALLY WEAR GLASSES? [YES] [NO]
IS WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE SPEED OF THE PHENOMENON? [GIVE ESTIMATE OF SPEED]
IS WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE DISTANCE OF THE PHENOMENON? [GIVE ESTIMATE OF DISTANCE]
DESCRIBE WHAT YOU SAW. INCLUDE INFORMATION ON SIZE, COLOR, NUMBER, FORMATION, ETC. OF OBJECT(S).
A COMMON OBJECT OR OBJECTS WHICH, WHEN PLACED IN THE SKY, SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU NOTED THE PHENOMENON COULD BE SOME DISTANCE AWAY. TO WHAT DO YOU COMPARE THE SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON?
DID THE PHENOMENON DISTURB THE GROUND OR LEAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE? [YES] [NO]
IF "YES", DESCRIBE.
