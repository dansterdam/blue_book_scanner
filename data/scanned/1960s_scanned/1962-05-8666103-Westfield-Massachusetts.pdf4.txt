TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch on the same line as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when last seen. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
