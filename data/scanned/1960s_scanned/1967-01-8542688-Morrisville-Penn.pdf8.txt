The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a series of questions about the observation of a UFO.

Text extracted from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Slowly, suddenly, gradually, in steps
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound Dark (probably circular) trail b. Color Intensely bright, no color visible, etc.
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. If you had performed this experiment during sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Approx 1/2
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing any features of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or glows on arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
