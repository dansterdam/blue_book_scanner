11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Objects observed for 2 1/2 hours. Object appeared as a light brighter than the brightest stars. Color changed from red to green to white. Object was observed on 12 July in same location. Reported as moving East.
COMMENTS: Object each time would appear to move toward the observed (East) if object was in the West. Observation on conjecture Arcturus at 275 deg azimuth 32 deg elevation setting at about 0330 (2 1/2 hours) later coincides with the disappearance of the object.
