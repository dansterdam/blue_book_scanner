OBSERVER: THEN THE T-33 APPEARED FROM THE OVERCAST WITH GEAR DOWN AND LANDING LIGHT ON, AS THE GLIDE PATH WAS ENTERED. THE FLAP APPEARED TO CAUSE THE AIRCRAFT TO HOVER MOMENTARILY. THE WARM DRY SUBSIDENCE INVERSION FROM 3500 FEET TO 12000 FEET COULD HAVE CAUSED SOME BENDING OF THE IMAGE PURSUANT TO "APPARENT" PHENOMENA OF A UFO. THE DISAPPEARANCE DESCRIPTION OF EACH OBSERVER ALL GENERALLY AGREE IN DESCRIBING A PHASE OF A GCA OR MISSED APPROACH FURTHER, THE TERMS PHENOMENA FOR THAT EVENING WAS MISINTERPRETED BY AN EXPERIENCED FIELD GRADE PILOT AS AN AIRCRAFT PERFORMING NIGHT AEROBATICS. THE LOW, FAST MOVING SCUD CREATED THIS APPARENT MOVEMENT AND IT WAS ONLY AFTER CLIMBING ON TOP THAT THE IP, A FORECASTER OF 12 YEARS EXPERIENCE COULD CONCLUDE HIM IT WAS IN FACT VENUS. IT WAS FURTHER REVEALED IN INTERVIEWS THAT A DISCUSSION FOLLOWED THE SIGHTING, BEFORE IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED, FEARING RIDICULE THEY ADMITTED "TALKING IT OVER". IT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT SIX AIRCRAFT SHOT GCA LOW APPROACHES AND/OR LANDINGS BETWEEN 2335Z AND 2542Z. SEVERAL OF THESE WERE MULTIPLE APPROACHES. IT IS MY CONCLUSION THAT THE LOW, FAST MOVING SCUD, BRIGHT STARS IS MY CONCLUSION THAT THE PHENOMENA.
