The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The text in the document is as follows:

Dear Mr. gyre,

Reference is made to your letter of April 18, 1969, in which you stated that you had forwarded three slides on this subject.

Should we be able to verify the receipt of these slides and determine their value to us, we will contact you accordingly. No slides were received with your letter.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
