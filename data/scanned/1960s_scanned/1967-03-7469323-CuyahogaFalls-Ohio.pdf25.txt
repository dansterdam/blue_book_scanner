The image does not contain a photograph. The text appears to be a handwritten account describing an observed UFO incident that occurred on March 31, 1967 in Dayton, Ohio. The text mentions that someone called the witness and said "a 'red light' moving over your house," which the witness then observed slowly moving from west to east. The light gradually dimmed and faded away. The text also mentions that the next day another person told the witness that it "was a helicopter, but she also heard one moving across the sky that she says looked like a plane, only it was a red light."

Dear Sirs,
I hope you will give this sighting consideration, even though I am 15 years old. On March 31, 1967 between 10:45 and 11:00 someone called and said a "red light" moving over your house. I went outside and saw a red light moving slowly from west to east across the sky. At first it showed as a light moving slowly, then it diminished and finally could no longer be seen. It pulsated. Gradually the light got dimmer and dimmer faded away. I waited for it to come back but it did not. The next day another person told me that it was a helicopter, but she also heard one moving across the sky that she says looked like a plane, only it was a red light. I honestly believe what I saw was something unconventional and I would be very interested to know what you think about it.
Sincerely,
[Signed]
