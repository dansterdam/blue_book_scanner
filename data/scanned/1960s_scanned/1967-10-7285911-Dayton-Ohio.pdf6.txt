The image provided does not contain any photographs, only a hand-drawn sketch and text. 

The text from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "X" on the car- horizon where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "V" on the compass where you first saw the object. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any change in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
