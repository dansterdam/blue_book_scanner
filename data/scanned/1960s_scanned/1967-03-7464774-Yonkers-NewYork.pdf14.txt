The particular sighting that I am referring to occurred on March 3, 1967 in Yonkers, New York. The object was first sighted at approximately 6:30 P.M. and was observed for a period of about 10 to 12 minutes. It was a large white object, circular in shape, with a red light on top and one on the bottom. It was traveling in a southerly direction at a fairly rapid speed. The object was completely silent and seemed to hover over the surrounding area. When the object was directly overhead, it appeared to be about 150 to 200 feet in diameter. It remained stationary for several minutes and then proceeded to move away towards the southwest and disappeared from sight. While the object was stationary, a small object detached itself from the larger craft and hovered over the area for a few minutes before rejoining the main craft. As the larger craft moved away, the smaller object seemed to be drawn back to it by some magnetic or electrical force. This is the one that I particularly noticed. When the main craft took off, the smaller object joined it and both disappeared from sight. As you view the film, you will find that the larger craft is much clearer toward the end, as I was able to see the smaller object more clearly when it was closer to the main craft. Toward the beginning of the film, the larger craft is more distant and not as clear. This is the object on which I concentrated the most, and this is the one I encountered on later occasions in the film. The least four frames show the main craft as it is leaving, and this is the one I concentrated on later in the film.
