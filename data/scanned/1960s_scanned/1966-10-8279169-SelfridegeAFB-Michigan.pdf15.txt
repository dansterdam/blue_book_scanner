Gentlemen:

I am not telling you what I have seen because I don't know what from Sanford. That's the truth. Don't ask me a lot of silly questions that most of use believe in the whole matter good up there. I never questioned it anymore and I never wanted to deny it. I am not a man bigger only that I have trouble on the ground and I go to look at what might or see at on the ground - see the shadow or any where. The body in your office you just write with a little helping to a little longer.
