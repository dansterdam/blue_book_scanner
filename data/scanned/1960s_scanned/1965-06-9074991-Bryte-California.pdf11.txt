Dear:
I read in Wednesday's State Journal your request for more data concerning UFO.
That reminds me of my friends and myself were outdoors at about 8:00 P.M. when it was quite dark. Two of us saw a brilliant, fairly large light which had a distinct outline. It disappeared almost immediately after it caught our eye and disappeared.
We think now that it was probably a meteor, but at the moment we were quite puzzled as to what it might be, off vehicle from another planet. Later in the evening, a friend looked up and saw it again. It also disappeared almost instantly.
Brother friend saw it.
