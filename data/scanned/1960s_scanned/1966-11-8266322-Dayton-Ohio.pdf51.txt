The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a questionnaire or report form.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
YES. AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD, IT SEEMED TO DIMINISH IN BRIGHTNESS GRADUALLY AND THEN DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY AT 20 TO 30 PAST THE VERTICAL POSITION.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): YES - NO - IF SO, WHAT DID IT MOVE BEHIND? IF YOU ANSWERED YES, THEN TELL WHAT IT MOVED BEHIND: IT DIDN'T, IT WASN'T OBVIOUS. PERHAPS CLOUDS OBSCURED IT MOMENTARILY.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes - No - (Don't Know) IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: NONE
b. Color: MOSTLY WHITE - BECAME SOMEWHAT RED AS IT FADED AWAY

18. We wish to know the apparent size of the object as compared to a known object at the time of the sighting. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
VIEWING WITH ONE EYE, THE WHOLE OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY A MATCH HEAD, PRESENT AT PERHAPS 20-30 DEGREES ALTITUDE. VIEWING WITH BOTH EYES, IT WOULD HAVE COVERED ONLY 1/2 AS MUCH, PREVENTING OBSCURING IT IF BOTH EYES WERE USED.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc.; and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

THE DESCRIPTION IS A STAR-LIKE - IT IS A POINT OF LIGHT SIMILAR TO A BRIGHT STAR. IT MOVED PICTURE FROM A PICTURE - HOW DO YOU DRAW A PICTURE OF A STAR?
