The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the path of an object in the sky, with instructions to place the object's position on point "A" on the curve and indicate how high the object was above the horizon. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road, with instructions to indicate the position of the object when it was first seen.

The text in the document is as follows:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that shows the path of the object. Place a "B" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a similar sketch or example of how to complete this drawing.
