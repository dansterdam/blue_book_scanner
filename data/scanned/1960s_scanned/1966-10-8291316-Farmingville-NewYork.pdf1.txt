Arcturus was on an Az of 286 degrees and an El of 10 degrees at approximately 1900 hours local.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers noted a star like object white in color traveling toward the northern sky. The object made a sharp turn toward the north. The object then made a sharp turn toward the west, and then proceeded toward the west. The object then became stationary over the town of Smithtown which was to the northwest of the observation point. The object was then watched for a long period of time.
The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. In regards to the observation of the stationary object in the west it appears that the star Arcturus was being watched.
