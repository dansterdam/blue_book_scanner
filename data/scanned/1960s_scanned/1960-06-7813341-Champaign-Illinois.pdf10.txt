CHAMPAIGN, ILLINOIS
7 JUNE 1960

On 7 June 1960, at approx 9:15 p.m., Mr. John Doe observed unusual lights in the sky while driving home from work near Champaign, Illinois. He stopped his car and got out to observe the lights more closely. He described seeing three bright, steady lights that appeared to be moving in a triangular formation. The lights were white in color and approximately the size of stars. They were traveling at an estimated speed of 300-500 mph and made no sound. After observing the lights for approximately 5 minutes, they suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

Mr. Doe immediately reported the sighting to the local police department. An investigation was conducted, but no other witnesses could be located and no physical evidence was found. The case was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further analysis.
