NOTE: In addition, Dr. Brunsfield seems to have seen the object about 1/2 (20) minutes earlier and some six (6) air miles or where the object was sighted by Olson; however, the other two cite the same time and location. Dr. Brunsfield stated he sighted the object and then retraced his route to the other junction but could not relocate to an accident; so all where he again sighted the object he brought it to the other officers' attention.
