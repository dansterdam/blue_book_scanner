Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon

TO: TDEW

1. Reference: Sighting of 18 April 1964 1930L near Manassas, Virginia. The time, location and description suggest this sighting may have been the 19 April 00302 radiosondes release from Washington, D.C.

2. Supporting facts
a. The radiosonde train consists of a balloon, a radiosonde package and another intermediate object. Oscillations of the radiosonde package may cause the entire train to take a triangular shape from time to time.
b. The time of the radiosonde train preceded the sighting sufficiently to allow a climb to an altitude consistent with the sighting angle.
c. Sunset for the area occurred at 1849 local time followed by 30 minutes of twilight. At the sighted altitude the radiosonde would first be bathed in direct sunlight. As sunset occurs for the higher elevation the radiosonde would be bathed in more of the reddish light from the sun. This might account for the observed color change. The time and altitude were correct for this transition. There were no weather systems and few clouds to the west which also permits this same color change at sunrise or sunset.
d. The trajectory of the radiosonde train is determined by the following winds:

1000 foot levels
2-12    250    20
14      270    25 
30      290    30
35      310    35
40      320    40
45      330    45
