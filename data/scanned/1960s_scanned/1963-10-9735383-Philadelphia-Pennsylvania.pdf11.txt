OFFICIAL FILE COPY

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Upon reviewing the UFO case for 1963 we find that additional information is necessary for the evaluation of your sighting. Would you please answer the following questions:

1. How many objects, including a maneuver or the objects, could you tell us what the duration was for the objects in view?

2. If it is anytime did there appear to be two objects, particularly larger, changed direction?

3. How was the speed of 10-60 mph and the distance of 7 miles determined?

4. The drawing which you made to describe the objects shown, this drawing appears to be accurate?

5. What was the direction of the UFO and its position before, during and after the sighting?

This drawing is very similar to those previously received by this office from other persons who have reported seeing UFOs. We would appreciate the return of a self-addressed envelope for your convenience.

Sincerely,
HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR
