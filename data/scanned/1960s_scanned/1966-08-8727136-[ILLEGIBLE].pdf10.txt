There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing text and diagrams related to observing and documenting UFO sightings.

27. Is the following sketch, imagine as at the photo shown. Place on "A" on the sky where the objet was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the compass where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "A" on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
