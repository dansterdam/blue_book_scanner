Dear Sir:
I would like to tell of a strange flash of light that shone on the night of August 15, 1961 around 2100 and 2300 hours. It was about the size of a baseball and lasted from 5 to 10 seconds. We spotted the object while looking for a satellite. The object appeared before and after the satellite came. The same time we spotted it, we started to travel south. As soon as we started traveling south, it then it would appear in another direction.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
