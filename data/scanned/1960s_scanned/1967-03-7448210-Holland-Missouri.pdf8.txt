The text of the letter is as follows:

MAY 18 1967

Dear Mr. -------,

Thank you for submitting your roll of 8 mm movie film for evaluation. The entire roll of film was found to be blank with the exception of approximately 1 foot. Within this footage are two images. A detailed photographic analysis of these images is not possible due to the fact that the film from the lens to the film was obstructed.

Photographic analysis reached the conclusion that the film does not contain photographic evidence to support or disprove unidentified flying objects.

Your interest in our program is appreciated. Your film is enclosed.

Sincerely,
