LAS VEGAS - A fire department official at La Madera, N.M., said he "saw about 25 circular objects resembling flying saucers in the sky Sunday night.
Curt Suthers, chief of the La Madera volunteer fire department, said the objects were "maneuvering at a tremendous speed" in the sky over La Madera, about 40 miles north of here.
Suthers said the objects were first spotted about 7:30 p.m. and were visible for about 15 minutes. He said they appeared to be about a mile high and estimated their speed at 600-700 miles per hour.
The report came in a dispatch from the United Press International bureau in Albuquerque.
All the reports said the objects were first spotted in the sky and one was then "observed to land" near La Madera.
The dispatcher said the reports came from the La Madera fire department but there were no details on whether an actual landing had been observed.
In a later telephone interview, Suthers said the objects he saw were a "rather violent orange-red in color" and varied in size from 30-50 feet in diameter.
The reports said the objects made a high-pitched whining sound and appeared to be hovering at times.
The dispatcher said all local law enforcement agencies had been notified.
