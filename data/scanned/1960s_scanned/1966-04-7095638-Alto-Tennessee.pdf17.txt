6. Mr. gave the following sequence of events.
He was driving along about 12 o'clock at night, and saw something in the sky. What is said to be a couple of words (frankly i was scared) and a light went out and came back. He said we didn't get out of the car, we just sat pretty good, lead on the lead on the car. We lost sight of it for a little while. We saw it again and did not lose sight of it again until it seemed to make a swing with the stars. We did not see it again.

7. It is again reiterated that Mr. seems reliable and information requested in your letter dated 21 Dec 1966 will be forwarded when completed.
