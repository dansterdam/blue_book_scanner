1. U.F.O. number 2 appeared about 1702 and lasted to 1730 on 13 December 1968. It was in the same direction as the previous sighting. It traveled in a southwest direction at about 10 knots. It disappeared in a cloud which was apparently and distinctly different from the normal cloud cover. It was sighted at site H-2 or by any military personnel. It was cloudy that night.

2. U.F.O number 3 appeared about 1715 on 14 December 1968. We received a report from civilian site 51 that an object was observed in the area. UTC and SN looked out and saw it. UTC and SN looked again later to see if it was still there but it was not seen again. The I.F.F. was not activated.

3. U.F.O. number 3 appeared about 1730 on 28 December 1968. The location was the same as U.F.O. sighted about 1. He said it could be observed from the site. FMC and I went out to observe it. It was a little hazy out but I was able to observe the object. Because of my certainty in evaluation I did not call the main base. The I.F.F. said it did not look like the object in UFO sightings number 1 or number 2.
