CONCLUSION:
THE OBJECTS OBSERVED BY MR. JOHN DOE WERE MOST LIKELY AIRCRAFT OR SATELLITES. WHILE THE DESCRIPTION PROVIDED DOES MATCH SOME PREVIOUS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTS, WITHOUT FURTHER EVIDENCE OR CORROBORATING WITNESSES, A DEFINITIVE IDENTIFICATION COULD NOT BE MADE. THE CASE IS LISTED AS "UNRESOLVED" IN PROJECT BLUE BOOK FILES.
