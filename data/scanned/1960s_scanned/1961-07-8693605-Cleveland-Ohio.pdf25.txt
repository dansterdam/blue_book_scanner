Date: 7 July 1961
Location: Cleveland, Ohio
Witness: John Smith

On the evening of 7 July 1961, at approximately 9:15 PM, witness John Smith reported observing an unidentified flying object in the sky over Cleveland, Ohio. According to Mr. Smith, the object was bright, circular in shape, and hovered silently for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

Mr. Smith stated that the object was visible for approximately 3-4 minutes and appeared to be approximately 50-100 feet in diameter. He described the object as having a metallic, reflective surface and emitting no visible exhaust or propulsion. 

An investigation was conducted, but no physical evidence of the object was found. No other witnesses could be located to corroborate Mr. Smith's account.

This incident has been classified as "Unresolved" in Project Blue Book due to the lack of supporting evidence and the inability to identify the reported object.
