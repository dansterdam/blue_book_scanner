The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a letter from the Office of the Secretary of the Department of the Air Force in Washington, addressed to Major Quintanilla. The letter discusses photographs that were lent to Life magazine and must be returned quickly, as the Air Force is still committed to analyzing them. The letter requests that copies of the originals be made and returned, and asks if George P. Freeman Jr. can further explain "Class's theories, publicized lately" about the photos. The letter is signed by George P. Freeman Jr., Lt Colonel, USAF, Community Relations Division, Office of Information.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

The photos inclosed belong to Life and were lent to
one of their people by one of District's file a personal favor
with this stipulation - we must return them quickly.

At the same time, we are still committed to Congress
to analyze these photos.

Would you make copies, return the originals (which are
really copies of the originals) as quickly as possible,
and use your copies for your analysis.

Hopefully, Class's theories, publicized lately, can
explain these photos.
