There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Transcribed text from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Continued conetanging flight, object appeared to be traveling at constant velocity.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note the comparative size of the object. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the match would have been covered by the object?

1/2

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

No, continued conetanging flight until lost from sight.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you observed.

The trail left by the object as it passed overhead appeared to be similar to the contrail left by a jet aircraft flying at a high altitude. I would estimate the object was traveling at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet or more based on the appearance of the trail. The size of the object itself appeared to be similar to a commercial airliner when viewed from the ground, perhaps 50-75 feet in length. The overall shape was approximately cylindrical with no distinguishable features that I could make out at the distance it was traveling.
