Dear Sir:

On the evening of August 17, 1966, I spotted an object 
over Syosset, Long Island. It was approximately
6 minutes past 9 p.m. and it was descending rapidly. It 
was a greenish-white light and it disappeared within about 
5 minutes to cross the sky. 

I would be possible to send me the name for the satellite 
I observed?

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
