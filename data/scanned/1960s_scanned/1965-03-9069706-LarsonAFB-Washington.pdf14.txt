30. Please note if any action other than being filed is required. 
31. There was no picture. I was disappointed, since I was hoping for one.
32. Was the investigation thorough enough? Was it possible that there was a craft of some kind there, but the witness failed to get a good photo? If so, could we ask him why? Was there anything peculiar about the sighting, such as the object's maneuverability or the fact that it disappeared so quickly?
33. I would be very interested in any comments you might have regarding this sighting and the investigation. Do you feel it was handled properly? Are there any lessons to be learned from it?
