4 Boys Report Seeing UFOs
Ten Objects Believed Sighted in Skies
Four Schenectady area boys claim they observed at least 10 mysterious objects in the sky as twilight was falling last night. The boys - John Terwilliger, 13, John Lane, 12, Eugene Lane, 14, and David Lane, 11 - say the objects were moving "erratically" through the sky and were "shooting rapid bright white flashes." Four of the objects were described as "saucer-shaped," one was apparently round and five were irregular in shape. The boys said the objects were at various altitudes. Their sighting was reported to the Albany Airport control tower and the Albany sheriff's office.
