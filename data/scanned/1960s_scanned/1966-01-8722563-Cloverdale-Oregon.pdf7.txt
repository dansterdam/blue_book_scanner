The image does not contain any photographs, only text. Based on the text, it appears to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text includes details about an observation made by A3c P. C. Collier, an NCO Observer, on the morning of 17 January 1966 in Cloverdale, Oregon. The text mentions that a sighting report was submitted previously and that two photographs were taken, but they were not included in this report. The document is signed by "DOCTOR QUINTANILLA, Lt. Colonel, USAF, Chief, Project Blue Book".

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can output all the text found in the document:
