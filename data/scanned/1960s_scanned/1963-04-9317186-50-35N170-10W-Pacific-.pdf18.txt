ASTRONOMY

Mars Still Bright in April Sky

Though Mars is rapidly receding and its apparent size is diminishing, it remains prominent in the evening sky of April.

ALTHOUGH MARS is rapidly receding and its size in the sky is diminishing each day, it remains a bright object in the evening sky of April. The planet is highest in the west at twilight, while Mars remains prominent in the southwest.

24, 1964

For a few days about then it will be difficult to see with the unaided eye due to the glare of the planet Venus, which will appear very close to it in the southwest sky each evening. But after April 1, Mars will again be easily visible as a rather bright, reddish object in the south-west.

Ordinarily, these maps show only stars and planets visible about 8:30 P.M. local time. But if you get out into the country, away from city lights, you can see much more. The gibbous Moon, for example, will appear close to Mars on the nights of April 1 and 2. And you may be able to see some of the fainter stars and constellations shown on the charts.

The planet Uranus is now relatively close to Mars and can be located with binoculars near the bright object. But it appears very small and dark in all but the largest telescopes.
