QUALITY One print and two transparencies provided by TDEW
1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order 65-1 from Major H. Quintanilla Jr. (TDEW) to analyze the image of an unidentified flying object which were submitted for study.
2. ANALYSIS: Mr. Charles Chapin and Mr. Larry W. Gunther, both from TDEPD, assisted in this analysis. The two transparencies and the one print which was produced from a negative, were studied.
3. COMMENTS: The two negatives (transparencies) and the one print which was produced from a negative, were studied. It is not possible to determine if the camera was stationary or moving. The station D emergency has many tiny spots which appear to be caused with tracks of possible stars showing up as a sharp number of images. These tracks could be caused by the object or a reflection or a refraction within the transparencies.
4. The number 7 transparency has similar lines as the number 6 transparency. These lines appear to be caused by the camera motion and are optical conditions.
5. The lines on the paper print seem to go in two directions, approximately 45 degrees apart from the paper edge. The back side of the paper print has a few brush hairs or a star or satellite trace. The back side of the print has an insignificant amount of these world is insignia. Because can be one or two things.
6. The film could have been exposed through porous material or black paper, thus causing the molted effect. This effect could also be caused by bad film or bad processing.
