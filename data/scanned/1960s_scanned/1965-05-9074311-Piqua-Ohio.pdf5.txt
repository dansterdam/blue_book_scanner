This image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page includes a diagram or sketch that seems to depict the motion or movement of a UFO or unidentified aerial object. There are also handwritten notes and comments on the page.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text from the document using optical character recognition (OCR):

And most frustrating thing about 9 this case is that I can't figure out what the thing was that looked like a star that whip past at an incredible speed. And I don't know if it was an actual solld object or just an illusion caused by some sort of atmospheric condition. The report says it looked like a star but was moving at a terrific rate of speed, faster than any airplane or missile. And I just don't know what to make of that.
