The image contains a photograph or illustration depicting a sketch or drawing, but no photograph. The text in the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? Half dollar

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head? If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? That's the angle. Wooden match

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? yes, it faded to nothing.

24. In order that you can give us a clear picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you observed. Looking up in the sky they looked rather like, or appeared as the sun moving through hazy clouds, or as a lighted street lamp or traffic signal through morning fog. That's the best description I can give.
