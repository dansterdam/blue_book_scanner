The image contains a chart titled "RE-ENTRY FLIGHT CORRIDOR" that shows the altitude and velocity of an object in space. There is no photograph present in this image.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
Figure 24 is a typical curve that shows the altitude and velocity. And this shaded area that you see is what we call the re-entry corridor. Normally, each square foot of the wing surface must carry some-what around 25 pounds per square foot. Going to this inflatable light weight structure, we can probably divide that by 10 and have actually around 2.5 pounds per square foot. This structure can actually come in and fly at the high altitude. These super lines here indicate the altitude at which you could probably fly with this vehicle and the lower region of this plot is the recovery a hard structure because it would burn up.
The upper line is the aerodynamic line. With our vehicle, you can see the whole thing is raised up. We can come in and fly at higher altitudes. We are still within the region of the curves here according to the speeds that we can achieve with this inflatable structure this is 2,500 degrees. We don't have to develop materials to go to such high temperatures as a hard structure. This is why if we can develop coatings and finishes to take 3,500 degrees, you can have a wing that will be cool enough to pressurize within.
