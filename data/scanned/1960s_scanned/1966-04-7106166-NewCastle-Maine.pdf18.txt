Dear Sir,
I am writing to give you a chance to examine our observations of some strange objects that seem to appear in the sky at night. We would be greatly interested in your examination of the matter. 

Last night, at about 9:30 PM, my wife and I were sitting on our front porch, gazing out at the sky when we observed a bright, very bright object which seemed to be coming from the east, traveling in a northeasterly direction. This object was approximately 7-8 miles from our house. The time was exactly 5:27 PM. At first there were 3 objects, but then they seemed to merge into one bright object which continued on its course.

The appearance of this object was very unusual. It seemed to be about 4 to 5 times the size of a star and was brighter than any star in the sky at the time. The object was definitely not an aircraft or any known type of aerial vehicle. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed and was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any other type of aircraft. 

These lights were very definitely while in color, making from the bright westerly sky if these blant and a believe from reading of objects which have been reported from various parts of the country and investigated by your organization.
