October 26, 1965

The Langley Research Center is conducting a research project with special balloons. The manufacturer of these balloons is the G. T. Schjeldahl Company, Northfield, Minn. A series of 10 of these balloons are being launched in the current tests.

The balloon is shaped like a blimp 15.7 to 16.3 feet long and about 4 feet in diameter. It has a fins or tail which are also inflated. It is made of metallized mylar plastic.

One was launched October 19, and two were launched October 20, and the other two will be launched today.

One of these balloons launched last week landed inland about 23 miles (air miles) from Wallops Island and generated a flurry of public interest.

The Air Force UFO Information Office at the Pentagon called this morning and they had been interrogated about a balloon which struck a power line and there was a banch. Florida, and exploded. They wondered if it might have been launched at Wallops. However, they indicated that any balloon launched at Wallops would drift - east, but not at Wallops Island. They believe that one was probably launched at the Cape in connection with the Gemini 6 mission. The schlejdahl Company representatives said they have supplied about 1300 meter metallized mylar plastic balloons for the current tests. The zero pressure balloon may have been one of these. However, the UFO Office said they understood the zero pressure balloon was shaped like a light bulb.

The problem people have feel that persons finding balloons should, if they want to find out where they came from, write the company, giving the serial number and the design/message number on the balloon.
