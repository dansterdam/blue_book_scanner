The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

5. The only other possible collaboration was a [redacted], who lives close by who said she saw a bright light in the sky but merely pulled down her [redacted] (A time sequence of scientific curiosity).

6. [Redacted] also indicated that when the light was closed to the car it was lower than the top of a telephone pole and seemed to be swooping down.

7. Unfortunately the [redacted] was unable to couch anything in scientific terms. He used vague descriptions and was not precise as to the motions of the light. He was precise about the roads used, and the distances his car traveled. It was clear from the conversation that he had been deeply moved by the experience. Also, he did not want any publicity since he thought that it would due his reputation any good. He didn't talk about his experience with anyone for several months but finally was inadvertently put in touch with a man from NICAP. This sighting is now, therefore, in the NICAP files.

9. I think it might be worthwhile for me to talk with [redacted] also.
