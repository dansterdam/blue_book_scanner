Dear Sir,
This object is about 180 mi NW of Dayton, Ohio. It was first seen at about 8:30 P.M. with bright rays passing out of it. I have observed about 22 times in provided about flying maneuvers around. Last night I got some good stories around. Hamilton, Indiana about strange lights on the horizon and I was told he was flying over low in the village. Blaine waited and I saw something that looked like a glowing light moving very fast in the night sky and was very excited for a little because it was not an ordinary plane. If you are interested in talking to some of these people, I will give my cooperation.

Sincerely yours,
