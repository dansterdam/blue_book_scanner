"Clarence Radich, 8 Rosedale St., Corning, N.Y., says in an undated letter to this station that on May 28, 1965, he observed a bright light which he described as 16-20 inches in diameter, approximately 300-400 feet in the air and moving at a rapid rate of speed. He said the light was brighter than a star and had a bluish cast. He observed it for about 30 seconds before it disappeared. A check with the Elmira Weather Bureau revealed no unusual weather conditions or aircraft activity during this period. The witness appeared to be sincere and sober. He has submitted similar reports in the past. Further details could not be obtained."
