This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The text appears to be a transcript of a conversation discussing a reported UFO sighting. The conversation mentions that the witness, a woman named Lucy, saw something strange outside and reported it to the authorities, but they did not believe her. The transcript also mentions that the witness was asked to fill out a form to report the incident.

The text found in the document is as follows:

It's general position. And then it sort of stayed there a while and then took just about the opposite motion - it lost its intensity and sort of went back to the same shape that it had before, sort of a blob and then it got smaller. I didn't see it go any more than 10 minutes.
Hynek: That is certainly very interesting. It's not unique. There have been other cases like it. There have been many, many cases reported of bright lights appearing, as you say, like that. So you don't need to feel that she is entirely unique in this.
Lucy: I would believe her. I would how no question about it.
Hynek: What I mean to ask is how did you happen to make the report this time?
Hynek: We were asked to.
Hynek: By whom?
Hynek: The names and addresses on the form, they requested who else had seen it.
Hynek: What I should have asked is - how did the Air Force get it in the first place - Did anyone report it to the police or something?
Hynek: I've seen that report. I have a copy of my letter here - it was written the 27th of August - and I was a little surprised when the form came. I didn't fill them out right away because we were busy doing some other things. Finally, I thought I'd better get busy.
