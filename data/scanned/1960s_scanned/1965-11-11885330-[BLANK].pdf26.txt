HIGH ALTITUDE PARTICLE PHYSICS EXPERIMENT
L. W. Alvarez, W. E. Humphrey

I. Introduction
Until about ten years ago, the discovery of all unstable "fundamental particles" had come from cosmic-ray experiments. The pion, the muon, the K mesons, and the three hyperons (Λ, Σ, and Ξ) were all seen first in cosmic-ray experiments. In the past ten years, large accelerators have almost completely supplanted the cosmic radiation as a source of particles for studying the fundamental interactions. Cosmic ray physicists have for the most part abandoned their studies of the interactions of the particles and have concentrated their attention on the cosmological aspects of the radiation. This situation has arisen from the well-known fact that artificial beam intensities in the 1-25 BeV energy region far surpass those available in the cosmic radiation.

II. Proposal
The environment mentioned above is accessible by balloon and affords flux densities which are useful in terms of present-day high-energy-experimental techniques. We propose to build and fly a balloon experiment capable of making measurements of the momentum of the "natural beam" and preliminary studies of its characteristics.
