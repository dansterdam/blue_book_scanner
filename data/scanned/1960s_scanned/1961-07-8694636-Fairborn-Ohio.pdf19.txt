The image does not contain any photographs, but rather sketches or drawings. The upper sketch shows a curved line across the top of the page, with what appears to be a burst or explosion of smaller lines coming from the side. The lower sketch shows a larger panoramic scene of a road or highway with mountains or hills in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Place a "T" on the same curved line to show where the object disappeared.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its last position. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
