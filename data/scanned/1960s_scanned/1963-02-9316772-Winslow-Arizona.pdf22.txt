SAUCERS IN THE SKY

Belgrade, Montana, February 22, 1963: As an object described as "a strange red ball of fire," was seen by Bill DeBad of Bozeman, Montana, at approximately 2:30 A.M. that morning. Telephones were disturbed and local citizens, who observed this strange object, said it hovered over their homes for several minutes and then disappeared. When police officers said they could find no trace of the object after coating the area, DeBad told them he had taken a photograph of it while it was still in the air (confidence would indicate the police cannot confirm this).
