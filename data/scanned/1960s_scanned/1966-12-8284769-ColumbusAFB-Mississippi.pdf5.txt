The image contains a sketch of a compass or navigation diagram, but does not contain any photographs. I will now proceed to extract the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curves to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "T" on the compass where you saw the object.
90°
75°
60°
48°
30°
18°
0°

28. On the path that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "T" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

AIRCRAFT APPEARED 4-5 IT WORC ON A DOME DOWNWARD FOR THE COURSE (CALM TRAFFIC)

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
N/A
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
