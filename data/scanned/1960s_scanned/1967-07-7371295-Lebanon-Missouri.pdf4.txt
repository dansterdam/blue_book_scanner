The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on what appears to be a document or report page. The text is written in cursive and discusses various details, including a name and location. I will now proceed to extract and reproduce the text from the image, without identifying any individuals mentioned.

The text in the image reads:

The first part reads: "The detonist area was one which could be seen all the time. It was nearly an entire day before the greatly astounded crowd and what had occurred foul the entire the scene was aglow and was a bright light so far as the surface earth was concerned..."

The second part reads: "15 June 1967 (illegible) Laboratory, 1717 S. Glenstone, Springfield, Mo. 65802"

The third part reads: "Eleanor H. (last name illegible)"
