The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an object that appears to be a UFO or aerial phenomenon. The sketch shows a bright red glow and a white hemisphere-shaped object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Went over houses and trees.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes. (IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:) Don't know.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes. (IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:) Don't know.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound None whatsoever, b. Color Brilliant red, Hemisphere shaped, bright white.
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 5 of object
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
