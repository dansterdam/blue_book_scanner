Dear Mr. __________,

Your letter to NASA concerning an unidentified aerial sighting was forwarded to this office.

As you did not give the exact location at the time of the sighting, it is impossible to confirm that you saw a definite object. The description you give does suggest that the sighting was caused by echo.

Since this information will be of some help to you, I hope this information will be of some help to you.

Sincerely,

MASTON N. JACKS
