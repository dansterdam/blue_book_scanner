Dear Ed:

I was not looking for UFO's. I was a commercial artist working in Waldwick, N. J. on a special project at the time of the sighting. On 10/31/64 I observed what appeared to be a very large silver object, oval in shape, high in the sky, near the horizon and moving in a northeasterly direction at a high rate of speed. It seemed to be glowing and flashing and I watched it for a few minutes. When I turned to call my wife to look at it, the object had disappeared from sight. I was not looking for anything like this and I can't volunteer why I noticed it in the first place. All I know is that it was a strange and impressive sight. 

I realize this report is hazy and not as complete as desired, but I hope it is of some value to you. If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Sincerely,
Carl
