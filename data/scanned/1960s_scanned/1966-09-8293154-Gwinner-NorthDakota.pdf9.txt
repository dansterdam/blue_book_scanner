The image contains two photographs or drawings related to the reported UFO sighting. One is described as "Photographs of site" and the other as "Drawing by [redacted]". The text does not provide any further details about the content of these images.

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

No aircraft, experimental or operational, is known at this station which would account for such impressions that were left in the field at the location. The possibility exists that the impressions could have been made by some type of hovering object near the ground and the sighting invents to go with them or that the "sighting" was reported in error or does not represent a true case of disapproving investigation.

If no conclusive evidence exists definitely linking and the impressions is unknown, atmospheric anomaly. However, based on the assumption that the reported sighting was reasonably valid, it could indicate that a casual relationship exists between the observed phenomena which could be significant and not involve the object reported is considered. This information that may become available.

Photographs of the site are attached plus the drawing made by Randy Rotenberger of his impression of what he observed.
