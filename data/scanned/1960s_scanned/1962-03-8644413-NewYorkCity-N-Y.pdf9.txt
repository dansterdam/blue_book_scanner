This forwarding information is submitted to assist you in applying to the attached sighting report.

On March 23 we received a letter from (redacted) stating that, on March 22, he and several other individuals observed a strange object in the sky over (redacted), lasting approximately 10-15 minutes. It was observed for five minutes, yet the speed was described as very rapid. 

On March 24 we received a letter from (redacted) who was an eye-witness to the sighting. His description was very similar to the previous report. He stated that the object appeared to make a fast climbing maneuver and then seemed to hover. After several minutes it seemed to accelerate at a high rate of speed towards the SKY where the object ended.

There is no association between the sighting and the appearance of any conventional air force or other aircraft. Even the most sophisticated fighter planes would certainly have been identified from a conventional aircraft. Based on the description, this object did not conform to the characteristics of any known aircraft.
