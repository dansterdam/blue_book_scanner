Socorro, New Mexico - April 24, 1964

At approximately 5:45 p.m. on April 24, 1964, a Sergeant of the New Mexico State Police, stationed at Socorro, New Mexico, reported seeing a strange-looking object land in the desert near Socorro and two humanlike figures emerge from it.

The Sergeant, who was a highly respected and experienced officer, stated that he was driving along the highway when he observed the object descend and land on the desert floor at a distance of about one mile. He said the object appeared to be approximately 40 feet in diameter and 15 to 20 feet in height, and had a dome-shaped top. 

As the object landed, the Sergeant said he saw two humanlike figures emerge from it. These figures, he stated, were about five feet tall, and were dressed in close-fitting black or dark-colored suits. He said they walked around the object for a few minutes, then re-entered it, and the object took off at a high rate of speed, ascending vertically.

The Sergeant stated that he stopped his vehicle, got out, and observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared from sight. He said the object made no sound and left no markings on the desert floor. The Sergeant's report was confirmed by a number of other witnesses in the area at the time.
