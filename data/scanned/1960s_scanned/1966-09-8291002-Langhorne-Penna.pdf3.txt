- There was no moon at the time and was a clear nite - Estimated the object to be about 3 to 3 1/2 feet in diameter. It seemed to be suspended in the air and made no sound. It hovered for about 5 minutes and then accelerated and was out of sight in about 2-3 seconds. There were no vapour trails visible.
