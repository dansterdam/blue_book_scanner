The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line on the horizon with an object above it, representing an object hovering above the horizon. The second sketch shows a person standing on a rural road with trees and buildings in the background. The third sketch shows a person standing on a road with a hilly landscape in the distance.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
