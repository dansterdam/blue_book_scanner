"Electrical Flashes
About 1 minute before the object hit the ground a blue-white light appeared on top & 'electrical flashes' seemed to be coming from the object. The flashes appeared to be very rapid just before the object hit the ground and about the same time the object appeared to split in half or do something of that nature according to the witness."
