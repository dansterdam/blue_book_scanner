'Ball Of Fire' Sails Off More Saucer Reports

A "ball of fire" sighted over Lebanon and Rockwood, Pa., is reported to have changed direction and speed several times, giving additional details of the prevalence at this time of the "flying saucer" reports in various parts of the State.

Mrs. Clyde Campbell, who lives near the Rockwood area, said that she and others in her family observed the mysterious object shortly before 9:30 p.m. Sunday. She described it as a bright light, approximately the size of a peach, moving in a westerly direction across the clear sky.

At this same time, police and other residents of the nearby communities of Warrensville and Wilkes-Barre reported sighting the strange light. One resident of Warrensville said it was almost as large as the moon and appeared to be traveling at great speed.

The UFO Center called the incidents "another in the continuing series of sightings in the central Pennsylvania area."
