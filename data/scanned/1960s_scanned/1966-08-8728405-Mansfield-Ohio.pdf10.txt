There is no photograph or image contained in this scanned document page from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be a typed text report describing an investigation into a UFO sighting incident.

Chicago Center Control at Joliet was then contacted, and a Mr. Bolasco examined the logs; there was no record or recollection of any unusual requests for radar coverage on August 26th. This is tempered by the fact that tapes are kept only 15 days and then are re-used; this investigation was done on September 8.

The Milwaukee FSS had no records or recollection of the incident, but referred the investigator to Milwaukee Approach Control; the watch supervisor, Mr. Phil Stepanski (414-747-8720) was contacted, and from him were obtained the names of the two controllers on duty at the time of the sighting. Mr. Stepanski requested that the phone calls be delayed until he could get in touch with the controllers himself to authorize them to talk with this investigator.

Mr. Carl Dodge and Mr. James Sidden, the controllers, were contacted; neither one of them had any recollection of anything unusual; both pointed out somewhat at length that they could not identify targets; as one put it, they can't tell a paper cup from a C-47. They made further that whenever they observe anything unusual, such as a fast object, they report it to Chicago Center Control, and they made no such report.

To find out how Mr. Howe, reporting officer on the TWX from TRAC, got the radar information about Chicago Center Control, he was called, but an alert was on and he could not be contacted that day.

Mr. Bishop was then called to verify the report from the Twin Cities International Airport; he verified it, and added that there was a separate observation phoned in later which caused them to reconsider the sighting. They then realized that it could not have been the moon, because of the time of day and the direction of the object.
