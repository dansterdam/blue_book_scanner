The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a handwritten document with text and sketches. The text appears to be an observation report or interview notes related to a UFO sighting.

The text in the document reads as follows:

This can be as large as a football field so "a" is the smallest one you could see. How long in the air could you see it? Not very long 20 or 30 seconds only to complete the latter motion.

It was round shape conditions at the time 
Slightly oval shaped at first 
Got smaller like it was going away
Seemed to stand still at times 
Didn't move very fast
No noise or light that I could detect
Didn't remember

When did you report to some official that you had seen this? Not until the next day when I got home from work.
