Dear Mr. Baker,
I regret to inform you that I cannot provide the object that you requested, as it was confiscated of my private property collection and labeled for further analysis and study. I was not made aware of the reasons why the object was taken, or who authorized the action. 
I was considering sending the object to you on request, as I had planned to do so, but alas it is no longer in my possession. I do hope that this does not cause you too much inconvenience. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist with.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
