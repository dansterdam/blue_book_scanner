The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, featuring a sketch or diagram related to UFO sightings.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the cusp or high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" on the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
