1. Reference your letter, subject: Request for information on UFO sighting dated 7 Nov 63 concerning a UFO sighting on 12 Nov 62 in Port Huron, Michigan.

2. Attached is a copy of the original account of the sighting from the Port Huron Times Herald, since Deputy Major R.S. Hopkins was unable to give us more detail than was published in the newspaper.

3. A check was made with local Air Force and Army helicopter units, and the SAC Missile Flight Service concerning this sighting. The helicopter units had no flights and FAA had no flight plans with the area during the sighted time period.
