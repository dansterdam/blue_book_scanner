War Department
WASHINGTON, D.C.

October 19th, 1961

Dear Sir:

I wish to report an unusual object in the sky over Overbrook, Philadelphia, Penna. Time 6:30 p.m. place, between City Line and Wynnefield on 63rd Ave., Phila., Penna. (I live at 6321 Upland St.,Phila. 31, Penna.) when I saw what at first was like a comet. Fiery ball as the head of the ball was a red object. The object was not traveling like a meteor. It seemed to be stationary and then would move a little and stop, something like we have never seen before. At 7 p.m. it faded into the ground, something like the old movies when they fade into the ground.

I thought you would like to have this report and also to check with any object that the United States Air Force may have had in the air at that time. I do not know if there was any report made from the Press on this matter, but what ever it was it was BIG and I have never seen anything like it but the initial report.

Again final report: Object fell like a lone yellow ball, meteors, comet, satellite or fell like a lightning/ground shock, that is the final report I have.

Most faithfully Yours,
Washington, D.C.
