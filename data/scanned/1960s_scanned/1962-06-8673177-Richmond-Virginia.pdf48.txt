The image does not contain any photographs, but rather an "Official U.S. Air Force UFO form" that appears to be filled out. There is handwritten text on the form.

Transcription of the text on the form:
"To: whom it may concern:
I am enclosing my observations which I feel pertain to the subject in question.
The information which you feel important and which is not adequately covered in the form enclosed.
This is as near as I can give an account of what I saw, which was a bright light
in the sky moving at a speed and altitude far beyond anything I have ever seen before.
It was moving from right to left and upward at a rather steep angle. It seemed to be without any definite shape and left no trail behind it. The total time of observation was approximately 15 to 20 seconds. I have thought a great deal about this incident and I am unable to explain what I saw in any rational way. 
I hope this information will be helpful to your investigation of this phenomenon."
