The UFO was gaining to the right and when it stopped it sailed down very quickly. I have been reading books about UFOs ever since this experience as I've read about the theory that 3/4 of the sightings are probably just some sort of anti-gravity device. I don't know much about flying but I think the fact that it was gaining in a straight line and then made a very quick vertical maneuver indicates that gravity had something to do with it. They may be of the USPO had been in the southern hemisphere it would have been spinning to the left. And maybe that's appearing just enough it can't include this.
