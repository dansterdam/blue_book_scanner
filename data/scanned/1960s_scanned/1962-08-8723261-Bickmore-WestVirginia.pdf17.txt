ASTRONOMY

Vega

Brightest Star Overhead

Toward the end of August, the bright planets Venus, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars appear in the August sky and Vega, the brightest of the visible stars, shines overhead in the constellation of Lyra.
 
With the coming of August the bright planets will be seen in the sky just after sunset. As the earth moves around the sun the positions of the planets change. These are Venus, Jupiter and Saturn.

Venus is brightest and for the first part of the month it appears very close to the horizon in the western sky. Later in the month it moves higher and appears less close to the horizon. This planet is now approaching its greatest brightness and will be near its maximum brilliance for this year.

Saturn appears near the western horizon during the first part of the night and as the hours pass it moves toward the southwest and sets around midnight. Jupiter is seen in the eastern sky in the evening and as the night goes on it moves toward the northwest and sets around dawn.

Mars is seen in the eastern part of the sky at sunset and as the night progresses it moves toward the west and sets sometime after midnight.

Vega, brightest of the visible stars, is very nearly overhead during the evening hours. Although it is one of the first magnitude stars, it appears brighter than many of the first magnitude stars nearer the horizon because air absorption has less affect upon it. Vega shines with a bluish-white light, a characteristic of hot, highly luminous stars.
