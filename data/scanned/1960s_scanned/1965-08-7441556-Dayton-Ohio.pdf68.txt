The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can output the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:      8      20     65
                                           Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The object was a solid white disc and appeared to be rotating slowly. Size was approximately 35' in diameter. It made no sound and moved rapidly at a very high speed out of sight in about 10 seconds.
