1. PROJECT LOG RECORD
2. LOCATION: Annapolis, Maryland
3. CONCLUSION: Probable Object (Reflection of SearchLight)
4. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer sighted numerous white or silver fuzzy elongated lights, appearing to be a plane and disappearing over the bay. Then another light was observed under the lights and disappeared soon after. The Annapolis Police Dept. received no reports of unusual sightings on this night. A cold front with rain and snow showers was moving just off the coast, and the unusual lights were probably reflections from searchlights on the clouds.
