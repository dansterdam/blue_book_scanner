K. Capt. Harry D. Logan, FV39036280
I have investigated the UFO report by Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Deeds. of this date at the Brownfield Municipal Airport, Brownfield, Texas. I have also made a thorough check of possible IFR air traffic and have found none that could account for the sightings.
The objects observed by the witnesses varied in size at times throughout the past year. This suggests to me that perhaps the same objects were observed at varying distances.
The objects were observed for 2 to 5 minutes on a total of 5 occasions. Most observations were made during clear night conditions. Estimated elevation was approximately 30 to 40 degrees with azimuth remaining fairly constant. The objects appeared to be at a much greater distance. An investigation officer and photographs were not available at this time.
