The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, containing instructions and sketches related to the observation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve above how the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, or "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
