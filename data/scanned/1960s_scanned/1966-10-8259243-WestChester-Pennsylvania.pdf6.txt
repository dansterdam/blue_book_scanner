The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire-style form with various questions about an observed UFO event.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
IT FADED AWAY VERY QUICKLY

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:)  Yes  (No)  Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:)  Yes  (No)  Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound  ABSOLUTELY SILENT
b. Color  ORANGE-YELLOW
c. Size  ABOUT THE SAME AS A VERY BRIGHT STAR

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil in line with a known object and measure the size of the object. If you have not performed this experiment at the time, please estimate the size of the object as it appeared to you.
VERY LITTLE OF IT, ABOUT 1/2 THE SIZE OF THIS PAGE

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[A hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a small, dim, oval-shaped object is present in the image.]
