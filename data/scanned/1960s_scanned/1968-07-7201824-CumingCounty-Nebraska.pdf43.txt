The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typewritten memorandum dated October 7, 1968, addressed to "Dear Hector" from "Philip J. Klass".

The text of the memorandum is as follows:

MEMO
PHILIP J. KLASS 
Oct. 7, 1968

Dear Hector:

Reference the Wm. Powers/Cuming County, Nebr. UFO sighting mentioned in a quick-dirty map plot of UFO sightings and estimated direction of the UFO. The important question is whether Powers was actually an eyewitness or whether he only heard about the sighting? If he did indeed see it, we should try to obtain his first-hand account and details about the sighting which may have been recorded on your map.

I'm exploring the matter further with Rogers.
