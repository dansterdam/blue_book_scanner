There is no photograph present in this document. The image appears to be a typed letter or report text.

About "as far away as the moon. The upright frame makes me even more positive that this object is not a man-made one, but in the far lower left of the frame another another object is pictured. This object is much larger, closer or course, but, as I am sure you can see from the exact focusing, it is a completely separate one.

You'll notice too that there are two dots just above the object in frame. Viewing and inspecting the negative under magnification I'm convinced that all of these objects were under 2 dots.

For your convenience, I've included in outline the data and several pictures. I have decided to the negative, since I have no further use for it.

I would deeply appreciate a reply as to the of my findings.

Thankyou.

Yours truly,"
