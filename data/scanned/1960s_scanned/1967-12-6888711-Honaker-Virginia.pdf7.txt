T would like to report on a very strange sight that was observe about the night of 12-6-67. I observe a round shape object with bright lights around the edge. This object was very high up and moving very much. 

I got at look at the object with this 7x50 binoculars. because I really seen something that would be possible to take a picture of at a U.F.O., but would not have been able to use my camera. The shape seemed to change from round to oval and the lights around the edge would dim and brighten up again at times. 

I decided it would be impossible to take a picture of this U.F.O., that looked as good as how I seen it. I rode out to where I could get a clear shot but it was gone when I got there. The object seemed to disappear very fast. I have never seen anything like this before.
