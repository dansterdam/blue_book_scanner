The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from the Air Force Materials Laboratory, Research and Technology Division, discussing the analysis of a "Metallic Sphere" that was delivered by Sgt Moody on 17 Feb 1965. The document provides details about the sphere, including its dimensions, weight, and density. It also notes that the sphere is an aluminum alloy casting and discusses its internal construction. There is no text or information about any human individuals.

SUBJECT: Analysis of Metallic Sphere

TO: TDEW (Sgt Moody)

1. On 17 Feb 1965 Sgt Moody of the FTD delivered a metallic sphere to the Materials Engineering Branch for Analysis. Examination of the sphere disclosed the following:

a. Consists of two hemispheres held together with 4 set-screws.

b. Approximately 9" in diameter (OD).

c. Weighs 23.99 pounds.

d. Wall thickness approximately 1".

e. Density is such that it would readily sink in water.

The sphere is an aluminum (195 casting alloy) casting that has been machined to a high finish. The outside diameter is 9" and the wall thickness is 28 threads per inch with Allen wrench head fitting. Internally, the sphere is essentially hollow with a shell alloy thickness of approximately 1".

g. This container was apparently designed for compressive type loads. The design is such that it would not be suitable for internal gas pressures because of the relatively weak method of joining the two hemispheres.

h. There are no external connections, hooks, eyes, entry ports or markings other than the machining tool marks.

i. There is evidence that a gasket had been used at the closing flange although no further material evidence.
