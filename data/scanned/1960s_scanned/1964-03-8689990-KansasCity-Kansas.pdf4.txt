Sir:

Sometime ago I sent in 
my U.F.O. sighting and have
not as yet received an answer
reply on it. I'd appreciate it
very much if you would,
please send me copy of Air Force
answer - the one with sketches
of several round flying discs
and the reddish U.F.O. from
the moon during early morn
hours over Miami, Florida,
also if can, the last two I had
seen different times. During
several over here.
