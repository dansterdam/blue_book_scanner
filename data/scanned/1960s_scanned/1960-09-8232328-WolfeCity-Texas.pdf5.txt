The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document on the letterhead of "The Wolfe City Public Schools" in Wolfe City, Texas. The document is a letter written by Emmit C. Mitchell, addressed to the Board of Education, describing his observations of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text of the document is as follows:

The Wolfe City Public Schools
SIDNEY WASSON, Superintendent
WOLFE CITY, TEXAS

To make sure that I was not deluding myself about the original object, however I recall making several checks, to wit:

1. The object exhibited a light of a lower temperature than any observed stars; this being considerably
2. It exhibited motion relative to fixed bodies which, it seemed to me, negated the idea that my eyes were
playing tricks on me (until later).*
3. I made a quick mental note of its relative position to
a couple of constellations which I think I could sketch
out at least roughly, thus ruling in or out stars.
4. I have observed the color changes of Mars before I do
not believe I could have confused the two.

In my observation of many aircraft during four years active duty
as James Connally and Lackland Air Force Base, I must definitely
state there were no aircraft lights or change in directions that
suddenly, in my opinion.

I have made notes in a little more detail if it would be of value
to you.

Sincerely,
Emmit C. Mitchell
