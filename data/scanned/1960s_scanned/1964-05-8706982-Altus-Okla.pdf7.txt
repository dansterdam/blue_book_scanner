Dear Major:

I am enclosing the equatorial crossing sheets for Echo I and Echo II for the year 1964, to the present. I shall send you copies of the new sheets as they come in, as they should be of good use to you.

With reference to the Altus, Oklahoma sighting, 21 May 1964, that definitely has proved to be Echo II, as you can see from the enclosed sheets. I believe the identification is positive.

The case of the Northwestern student from Highurst, Illinois is in abeyance. The student is now cooperating in the investigation. I have his written permission to prosecute the matter further. The sighting, in any case, contained very little information, and it does not seem advisable to budget more effort on this case at the present time. Since we have gone this far, however, if you feel it worthwhile, my name and I have no objection to his being questioned if it might bring forth. But I don't think it's much worthwhile.

What are your plans on coming up with a new week in December 7 as the one following I am scheduled to be in Austin, Texas for a few days, and during the time in December, I shall be in New Mexico.

With respect to the Altus case, would it not be a good idea to drop a note to Mr. Davis and Gomez to let them know that they had seen Echo II (Good Inter-Air Force relations).

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
