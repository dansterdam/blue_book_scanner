The image contains two illustrations. The top image is a compass-like diagram showing directional labels, such as N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW. The text below the diagram explains that the diagram represents "the position of the phenomenon when first seen" and provides details about the movement and orientation of the phenomenon.

The bottom image contains two smaller illustrations. The one on the left depicts a person standing on a road or path, with mountains or hills in the background. The image on the right shows a similar landscape with a road or path leading towards the horizon.

AFR 60-17(C1)
THIS FORM IS TO BE USED IN THE EVENT THAT A "SIGHTING" OF A FLYING OBJECT OCCURS. IT IS TO BE CONSIDERED AN "AID" IN THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT AS FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE OBJECT WHEN LAST SEEN.
IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "Y" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "Y". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO MILLER SKETCH AND AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS DIAGRAM.
