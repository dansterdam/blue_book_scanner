The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass-like diagram with directions labeled. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road with hilly landscapes on either side.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text from the document as requested.

6a. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON AS IT MOVED.
7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW IN THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "Y" THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ERRATIC. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS ITEM.
