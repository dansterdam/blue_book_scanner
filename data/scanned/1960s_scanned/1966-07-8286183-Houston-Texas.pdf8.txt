The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typewritten letter or document from the Department of the Air Force regarding a request for satellite information dated 8 July 1966. The text in the document is as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
1ST AEROSPACE CONTROL SQUADRON (ADC) 
ENT AIR FORCE BASE, COLORADO 80912

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: LOOP-DA/Lt. Herche/2072

SUBJECT: Request for Satellite Information, 8 July 1966

TO: Hq Foreign Tech Div (TDETR)

Reference the attached letter from [redacted] due to the relatively limited information on the sighting. It is difficult to identify the object in question with great certainty. However, taking into account the visibility characteristics described, we believe an object in the vicinity of the upper stage (Scout) of a Transit-2A launch on 14 June 1962 (NORAD object number 519, international designator 1962-034A) may be the one described in the visual report.
