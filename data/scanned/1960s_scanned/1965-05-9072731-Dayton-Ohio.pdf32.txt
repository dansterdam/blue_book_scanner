I have seen a small light like an aircraft that hovered and then left at a high rate of speed. The light was very bright and dimmed at times. The sighting lasted about 1 minute. This was a rare and unusual occurrence and has made me very curious about UFOs and unexplained aerial phenomena.

When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
