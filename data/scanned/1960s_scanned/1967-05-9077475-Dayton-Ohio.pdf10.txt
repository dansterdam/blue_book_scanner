10. CONCLUSIONS Observor first thought that the object was a star but after looking at it, noticed that it had two beams at angles from its center and was moving towards the object. The object then vanished in 3 minutes leaving no trace. No noise was heard.

But there is nothing to indicate that the object could not have an unusual or extraordinary nature. The object is estimated to have been approx. 40 miles distant.
