Race Discrimination With a Union Label
By Lester Veile
While union constitutions boast of brotherhood, unionmen in America have been opposed to the general freedom to seek employment and, in many cases, have denied them from such entirely.
Unionmen, equally and invariably, Union labor battles for the exclusion of Negro labor from various trades - the electricians, plumbers, sheet metal workers and others - who make up the building and construction industries, and engravers, and many locals of the craftunions.
For although the 13th-13th-14th Amendment and the civil rights acts have made these discriminatory practices illegal, the unions still maintain a semi-closed shop and deny Negroes the right to learn many of the skilled crafts although this denies them the means of earning a livelihood. 
In Washington D.C., school children of "Negro" parentage are not admitted to the integrated schools, but are set up in separate, segregated schools, contrary to the Supreme Court decision. This very same situation obtains in many other areas where unions have a strong stranglehold and cling tenaciously to the "white supremacy" policy.
