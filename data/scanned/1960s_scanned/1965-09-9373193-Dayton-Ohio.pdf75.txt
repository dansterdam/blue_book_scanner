In re: Missile over Kentucky

What has been written here about a flying missile need not be discounted in any way, and can be taken 100% for granted. I am high on the list of people who has had 20 years of experience with so-called flying saucers. I have consulted many military pilots, radar experts, and other experts of various kinds.
If a person spent six years of his life in a combat, he would have the same instinct for fear of death that a deer has when it hears a twig snap in the woods. That is the way I feel about flying saucers. 

If Cape Kennedy cannot account for the missile, then I suggest most earnest consideration of the conclusion it was not from Ohio.

Sincerely,

P.S: I agree with above that I was looking almost due northwest, my lights on a 40Â° sight, when the missile passed me very right to left.
