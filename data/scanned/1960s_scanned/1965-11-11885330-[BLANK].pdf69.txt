The text in the document states:

"Fig. 1 The hyperbolic mirror M, the ellipsoidal mirror M', and the photomultiplier PM make up the Cerenkov counter C1, C2, and C3 in coincidence trigger the entire system. To exclude interactions before the target, the pulse height in C3 must be no more than that of a single particle.
