CASE NO. 61.17
DATE: 8 SEPTEMBER 1962
LOCATION: PRIEST LAKE, IDAHO
INVESTIGATION BY: MR. FRED KOGER 
ACTUAL DATA:

Camp. The camp. site was located in a heavily wooded area at the edge of Priest Lake. The object was sighted at approx. 10:30 pm while observers were sitting around a camp fire. The object was first noticed in the eastern sky, traveling in a north-westerly direction at moderate speed at an estimated altitude of 2500 - 3000 ft.
The object appeared to be a luminous, round or oval shaped body, changing colors from bright white to orange, green, and blue. At times it pulsed with different degrees of intensity. it appeared to be under control and altered its course and speed on several occasions. The object was observed for approx. fifteen minutes before it disappeared from view behind the trees.

CONCLUSIONS: The object observed appears to have been a genuine unidentified flying object. Its appearance, maneuverability, and duration of sighting are inconsistent with any known conventional aircraft or astronomical phenomenon.
