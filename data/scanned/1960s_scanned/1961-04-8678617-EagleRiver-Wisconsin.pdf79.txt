Dear Sirs:

Her information concerning UFO problem

Recently I have been reading various articles concerning the reported sightings of and contact made with UFO's. Personally, it is my understanding that this is the actual contact which the Air Force has conducting and study, and on which they now have fairly complete information, that also the chemical analysis of samples of material from UFO's has been made by the Air Force.

I am also personally interested in some reports of UFO's in or around Beloit, Wisconsin. Unfortunately, the reports of the total reported sightings are still classified.

About how many reports coming from Wisconsin are still unknown. What conclusions have the Air Force drawn about the UFO problem.

Thank you for your assistance on this matter.

Sincerely Yours,
