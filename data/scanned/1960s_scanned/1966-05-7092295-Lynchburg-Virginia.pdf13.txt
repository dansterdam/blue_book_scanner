The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that contains handwritten text.

Text from the document:

The car is quite early. The object observed was slightly luminous and appeared spherical. It was observed for some few minutes and moved across the sky at a relatively high speed. The object was observed across the eastern horizon and appeared to grow dimmer as it proceeded on its course. No noise was heard. The object was first observed at a relatively low elevation in the eastern sky and moved across the sky disappearing from view. No other observers were noted. However, it is possible that others may have seen the object but did not report it. The relative speed and movement of the object across the sky suggests that it was an aircraft of some kind. It is quite likely an aircraft but could also be some other high-flying object of a relatively small size. The object was not characteristic of a satellite or a meteor. It appeared to be a definite object possessing luminosity and moving purposefully across the sky. The movement and speed of the object does not suggest a balloon, as the motion was quite definite and controlled. While the object was not tracked on radar, the visual observations suggest a reasonably solid object of some kind. This object would appear to be an unidentified flying object, the nature of which cannot be positively determined from the information available. The sighting is somewhat unusual but does not appear to be a hoax or to involve any advanced technology not presently known. The report contains no photographic evidence or physical evidence of the object, and there are no other known witnesses. The description of the object is consistent with a conventional aircraft, but the speed and controlled movement are not entirely typical. Overall, this appears to be a genuine sighting of an unidentified flying object, the nature of which cannot be conclusively determined from the available information.
