The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather a sketch or diagram showing the elevation of an unidentified object above the horizon, as well as instructions for the observer to draw a picture showing the motion and changes in direction of the object.

Extracting the text from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that shows the highest point the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" at the point where you last saw the object.

28a. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
