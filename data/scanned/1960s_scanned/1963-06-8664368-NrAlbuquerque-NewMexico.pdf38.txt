SUMMER STARS BEGIN TO APPEAR 
By JAMES STOKLEY

THE SUMMER STARS are beginning to show in the evening skies in the northern hemisphere. Mars, the only planet visible at this season, will grow more brilliant as the weeks pass.

The stars of summer, such as the bright blue-white Vega, the equally brilliant blue-white Altair, and the orange-red Antares, are starting to take their places in the evening skies which already are beginning to show the summer constellations. 

As the season advances, these constellations will become more prominent, while those of winter will fade from view. Saturn, for example, is now setting earlier each evening, and will soon disappear entirely from the night skies.

The chart accompanying this article shows the positions of some of the more prominent stars and constellations at about 1 a.m. local time in the middle of June (or 10 p.m. daylight saving time), a time when the summer skies are fully developed.

Scorpius Partially Visible

In the southern part of the evening sky, the brilliant constellation of Scorpius, the Scorpion, is becoming visible. Not all of the constellation is visible at the north, but the parts which are brilliant appear at that time.

This includes the brightest star, Antares, which is a red supergiant star that would appear even more brilliant if it were closer to us. But it is distant, and its great luminosity is lessened by the great distance.

As noted above, Mars passes close to the west of Antares during the month of June, and they will be so close together that they can be readily seen with the unaided eye. This event is one of the few occasions when the two planets may be easily compared, since Mars is so far north of the celestial equator that it is never very close to the region of the sky where the planets normally appear.
