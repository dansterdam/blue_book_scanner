The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains two sketches - one of a trajectory path and another of a circular object with rays emanating from it. The text on the page provides instructions for the reader to imagine that they are the observer at the point shown in the first sketch, and directs them to place markers on the sketch to indicate the positions where they first observed the object, where it disappeared, and any changes in direction during the sighting. The text also asks the reader to draw a picture showing the motion of the object, and questions whether there was more than one object observed and the direction they were traveling.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the record line to show the point where you first saw the object (outline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the sketch where you last saw it. Place an "X" on the diagram where you think the object changed direction (if any).

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture showing how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
