14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object gradually disappeared. It seemed to move away at a constant rate.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes. It moved behind a cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): No.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: The object made no sound as it moved and disappeared.
b. Color: Bright green, light with dark tips (lights).

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About 5 degrees.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
The drawing shows a green, round light with no distinct shape or features, moving from right to left.
