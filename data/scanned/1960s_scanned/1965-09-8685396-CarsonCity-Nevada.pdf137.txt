TEEM/UTO
UFO SIGHTING 7 OCTOBER 1965

HQ USAF SAYOICS (Mrs. Hunt)

We have received a report of an unidentified flying object from
Mrs. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - at 3:05 am PT on 7 Oct 65. She reported her sighting. A review 
of her report indicates that the object appeared circular in shape and
had a luminous glow. It was observed for about 20 minutes as it
maneuvered and hovered in the sky. The object was first observed
to the west of her location and moved slowly to the north and then
back to the west before disappearing. The description of the object
conforms with this analysis. It was described as about 50 feet in
size, capable of very rapid acceleration and deceleration, and
oscillating or "pulsating" with a bright light. These are typical
characteristics of UFO's as they have been observed in the past.
A light was observed toward the northwest as the object seemed to
diminish in size and disappear. No sounds were associated with the
observation. 
This object was observed for a period of about 20 minutes, much
shorter than the 30 seconds reported by the witnesses. The duration
of sightings can vary greatly depending upon the distance from the
observer and the atmospheric conditions.
We have given you an evaluation of a possible sighting.
