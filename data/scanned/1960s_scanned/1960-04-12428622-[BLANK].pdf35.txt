"12. We seem intent here to spend much to send a probe to some other planet to take a sample of the surface and return, so this might be worth at least as much effort and expenditure from elsewhere which facts that would contradict it, but I am sure that none of us here would accept that explanation without a great deal more corroborative evidence.

Herein the scientific investigator must differ from the DPO methodologist who jumps to conclusions/largely because he wishes it to be so, he automatically accepts it as being so. We still must address ourselves to the task of evaluating whatever (the stimuli) that gave rise to the typical example I have outlined to you. I should say, the typical "unknown" since the language requests essentially for DPO reports are indeed perfectly familiar and sensible that have been identified by the person making the report. We must remind ourselves again that a UFO is nothing more than any aerial sighting or phenomenon that remains unexplained long enough for someone to write a report about it. We have been inundated with reports that continue to remain unexplained, What can we say of such reports that generally recount observations or impressions concerning stimuli that have proven elusive to analysis?-the problem of the stimuli that generated such reports (all in the province of science? We must remind ourselves that science can progress only when phenomena are reproducible, measurable, variable and, particularly, when numbers can be assigned to specific aspects of the phenomenon. Ephemeral, fortuitous, and particularly when numbers can be assigned to specific aspects of the phenomenon. Ephemeral, fortuitous, and particular, reportable phenomenon can be said to exhibit these characteristics only with great difficulty."
