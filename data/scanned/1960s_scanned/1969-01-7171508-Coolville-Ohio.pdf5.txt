Transcription of the text in the document:

The light in the sky was bright and lit up the entire area. It hovered almost directly over the tree tops and seemed to be pulsating on and off at irregular intervals. The object appeared rounded or oval shaped, but the light seemed to be emanating from the entire object rather than from one definite source. It was a bright whitish-yellow color and appeared to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter. The object maintained this position for several minutes and then suddenly accelerated to a high rate of speed, moving to the south. It was not more than 200 to 300 feet from the ground and covered the distance of approximately 1/2 mile in only 5 to 10 seconds. There was no sound of any kind associated with the object. It just disappeared from sight at a tremendous speed. I do not believe this was any known type of aircraft. I am quite certain that what I saw was some type of unidentified flying object. I have had some experience observing aircraft and I can say with confidence that this was not a conventional aircraft of any kind.
