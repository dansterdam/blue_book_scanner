Three-legged object
The object was first observed at 9 p.m. on 6 Aug 65 by two men at Parkes, N.S.W. Australia. It was described as a three-legged object with a ring around the middle and a bright light on top. The observers, who saw the object at 3 a.m., said it was tilting on its legs and emitted a bright glare. It was about 1/4 mile from the observers and was visible for about five minutes before disappearing. They watched the object for about an hour, and it seemed to be about two miles from the radio telescope city. But the object was not seen on the radar scope. After it disappeared, it was seen again at 4:15 a.m. about 6 or 7 miles from the original sighting.
