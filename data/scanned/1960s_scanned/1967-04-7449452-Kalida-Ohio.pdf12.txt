There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document containing a questionnaire or form with handwritten responses.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The handwritten response indicates the object did not disappear while the witness was watching it.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The response indicates the object did move behind something, with "Yes" circled.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The response indicates the object did move in front of something, with "Yes" circled.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - "shiny, round, silent, soundless"
b. Color - "white, bright, brilliant, glistening"

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The handwritten response provides details about the size of the object in relation to a match stick.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow inside to show the direction the object was moving.
The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of the observed object.
