11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers called duty officer to say that they had been watching a bright starlike object for 20 minutes and they were still watching it. The object was described as being similar to a turnking light, and its side. Comments: A 117 was sent to the observer but was never located. Information as to how long they watched the object for elevation and azimuth when first- and last- seen, and how the object disappeared was not supplied. It seems likely the observer was watching a star/or planet, however until more information is received the case is being carried as insufficient data.
