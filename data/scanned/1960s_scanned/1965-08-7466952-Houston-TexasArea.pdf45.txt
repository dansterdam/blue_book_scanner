investigative statement: was approximately 193O Houts. 19 August, has been able to obtain any information or copies of reports on the apparent sighting of a very bright and unusual aerial phenomenon which apparently occurred across much of the Houston, Texas, metropolitan area on the night of 7 August 1965. The details of the incident are sketchy, but it appears that a large number of local residents reported seeing a very bright, luminous object or objects in the sky over the Houston area during the evening hours of 7 August. Many of the reports described the object(s) as extremely bright, maneuverable, and exhibiting a variety of colors. Some observers reportedly saw the object(s) break up into smaller fragments or pieces before disappearing from view. The Air Force and other authorities apparently received a large number of telephone calls and other inquiries from the public regarding the incident, but no official report or investigation appears to have been conducted. This office has been unable to locate any documentation on the matter, and it is not clear if any physical evidence (such as photographs) was ever obtained. The lack of a formal investigative report is unfortunate, as this appears to have been a significant aerial sighting over a metropolitan area. Without more details, it is difficult to assess the nature and origins of the phenomenon. This office would appreciate any information you may be able to provide on this incident or on similar aerial sightings in the Houston area during this time period.
