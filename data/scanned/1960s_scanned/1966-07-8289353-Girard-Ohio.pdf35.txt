This impression from the object as it passed by the witnesses was that it was a metallic, saucer-shaped object, about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and 10 to 12 feet thick at the center, tapering to about 6 feet thick at the outer edge. The object was reported to be a bright, luminous white color, and to have made no sound. The object was observed for an estimated 2 to 3 minutes and was reported to be traveling at a speed estimated to be between 600 and 700 mph. The object was observed by two adult witnesses who were standing together at the time of the observation. The observers were interviewed separately and were found to be reliable and sincere in their reports. Their descriptions of the object were consistent in all the important details.
