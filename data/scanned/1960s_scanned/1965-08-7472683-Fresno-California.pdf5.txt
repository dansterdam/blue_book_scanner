THE HONORABLE E. E. HARR
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WASHINGTON 25, D. C.

Dear Borne:

This letter is in reply for the purpose of substantiating the enclosed objects.

AS APPROACHED-NEARLY 11:45 LAST NIGHT ONLY FOUR PERSONS
RQ: bad a similar experience to mine. Having just returned from work, it was slightly after midnight. While looking out the kitchen window, I observed two brilliant objects in the eastern sky, moving at a fast rate of speed northward and did not leave a trail. The first one seemed to dart or flash and then would appear again some distance up and the second object followed along behind and both objects seemed to be maneuvering or darting around. I called my wife and son to observe and all three of us watched for about 3-5 minutes when they disappeared from sight. The objects appeared unusually fast and their movements appeared erratic and in a darting fashion not normal or common to any known aircraft.  

AS 11:32 P.M., AUGUST 9, 1963, the objects were again observed, moving in a northern direction and appeared to be larger in size than any common aircraft I am familiar with. They appeared to be self-luminous and not reflecting any light from the ground or the sky, seeming to be their own source of light. Their maneuvers did not appear to be controlled and they seemed to dart, flash and move in an erratic manner, appearing and disappearing, first appearing large and then becoming smaller as if varying their altitude rapidly. I would estimate that the objects were airborne for a period of at least 3-5 minutes on both occasions.

I TRUST THIS INFORMATION MAY BE OF SOME VALUE TO YOU IN YOUR WORK.
