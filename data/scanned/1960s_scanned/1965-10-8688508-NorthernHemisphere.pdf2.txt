The image does not contain any photographs, but rather it has text describing photographs of a comet called Ikeya-Seki. The text provides details about the photographs, such as when they were taken and by whom, but the actual photographs are not present in this particular document.

Photographs of Comet Ikeya-Seki
These photographs were obtained by various observers and are thought to be among the best ever obtained of this comet. They show the changing appearance of the comet as it approached the Sun. The photographs presented here are only a small sample of the pictures that have been taken of this comet.

Above: On October 25th, only five days after perihelion, the comet was photographed by Dr. L. E. Cunningham of the Lick Observatory, California. This photograph shows the tail curving away from the Sun.

Left: Note the very marked Tail structure, taken on October 29, 1965, with a 5-inch refractor by J. B. Nickless.
