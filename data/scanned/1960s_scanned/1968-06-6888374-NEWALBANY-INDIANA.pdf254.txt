NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. PLACE A Y ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED WHEN LAST SEEN.

[The text below the compass diagram is instructions for the user to follow.]

POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE A AND B WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. AS AND B, STATISTICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT
APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT OR CURVED. SKETCH THIS TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT AS COMPLETELY AS POSSIBLE.
