The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing questions and a space for a hand-drawn sketch.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Left by itself, rapidly descending, turned off and disappeared rapidly.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one):     (Yes)       (No)       (Don't know)   If you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one):     (Yes)        (No)       (Don't know)   If you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound       Saucer-like
b. Color        reddish - light 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
6 to 8 degrees

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.
