PROJECT 10073 RECORD
2. LOCATION   Corpus Christi, Texas
10. CONCLUSION
Both Jupiter and Sirius were rising just a few degrees above the horizon, and were clearly visible, as they appeared to be moving at an angle of 70 degrees.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer noted a round shaped object climbing slowly in the eastern sky from a low altitude. The object was observed for approximately 20 minutes.  The object did not disappear but was still there 80 minutes later.
Although both Sirius and Jupiter were rising on the horizon, some confusion still remained as to the identification, since this particular astronomical event is not very common.
