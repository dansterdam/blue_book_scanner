The image does not contain a photograph, only handwritten text. I will now act as an OCR system and transcribe the text found in the document:

I could see it was headed in the direction I was traveling but it came right over me and made no sound whatsoever and was about 100 yds. Above the ground. It's shape was oval to round in nature and seemed to give off no light but had a definite outline. It made no sound and appeared to be under intelligent control as it changed course and speed several times and then disappeared straight up at a terrific rate of speed. No vapor trail or exhaust was visible. I would estimate it to be about 45-50 ft. in diameter.
