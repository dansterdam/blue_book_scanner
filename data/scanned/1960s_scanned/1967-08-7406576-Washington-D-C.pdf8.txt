SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 22 August 1967, Washington, D. C.

TO: TDETTO

1. Reference is made to the message sent from this Headquarters, 23 August 1967, concerning subject sighting.

2. An investigation conducted by the undersigned has failed to positively identify the object sighted over Washington, D.C. at 2220 hours (August) on 22 August 1967.

3. However, it was able to locate a Washington, D.C. policeman (whose name was deleted by the censor) who claimed that he saw the object. He stated that he was on duty in the Georgetown area on 22 August 1967, when he noticed an unusual light in the sky. Like a flare. He said the object appeared to be about the size of a basketball and yellowish in color. He first saw the light after noticing other groups in the area and trying to determine what they were looking at. He said the light was almost overhead and that when he approached, the object moved away. He said it was standing on the corner of Wisconsin and Q Streets.

4. Capt stated that his first reaction to the object was that another policeman had been observing it at the same time and had said it was similar to what he had seen on the evening of 22 August 1967.

5. It is deemed this possibility of the object being the result of a prank. He said that was what he thought it was when he saw the object.

6. I asked to watch for the object to appear again and let me know if it did. He said he would and would advise the other policemen in the vicinity.
