Dear Major Quintanilla,
I have a confession to make. When I was in your office Monday afternoon, I did not tell you everything I know about the recent sightings and events. I am sorry I could not be completely truthful with you. Is there anything else I can do to assist in this matter of the reported sighting? I certainly hope my feelings did not confuse you. I believe that in telling you the may trip the balance scales as to whether this craft was from another land from Russia. I am certain I must indicate that the sightings tend toward Russia as a source of the probable nuclear-powered space craft.
