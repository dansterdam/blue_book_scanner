There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book.

Based on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

Blue light. It was brilliant or metallic color, and was surrounded by a haze.

According to the object appeared stationary, at first toward the south, all this time, and then emitted a brilliant white glare, like a magnesium flare.

For it could not see it.

According to the observer who looked later and just saw a brief glimpse, the light did flash on briefly, revealing a circular shape, and then the object traveled at high speed from the west toward the earth, finally disappearing behind trees in the west-southwest. The whole movement took about 2.5 seconds.

The object showed no features, but had a definite (elliptical) shape. It was silent.

The sighting was very brief, lasting a couple of seconds. Little can be learned from the description that provides identification. Photo mission, the discs being a "satellite radar disc". This is a weak explanation, however, unless the haze can be accounted for. If the hazy object is a vehicle, they may simply have failed to identify the moving object after the initial flash.

then no explanation in conventional terms can be offered. There is no basis for a choice between the reports.

One SAF personnel at Lansing, Michigan, and Jackson, Michigan, telephoned to report object as described above that was driving extremely fast, apparently at high altitude at around 12 May. Such call gave a brilliant blue light to the horizon, traveling airless than 1/2 mile, appeared and disappeared. Then said that the object lasted perhaps 1/2 to 1 1/2 miles away.
