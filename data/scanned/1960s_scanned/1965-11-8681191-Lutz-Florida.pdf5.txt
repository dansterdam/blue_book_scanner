EGLIN AFB, Fla., Nov 18 - CHEMICAL TRAILS - Chemical trails such as these have been creating quite a stir during the past week throughout the southeastern part of the United States. The trails were visible in the sky around the sun-rise hours when more made by vertical probe launches here at the Air Proving Ground Center. The rocket firings were made in conjunction with the International Quiet Sun Year (IQSY) program. It is during this time that scientists around the world study the effect of the sun on the ionosphere, a part of atmosphere starting about 40 miles above the earth's surface and reaching to about 500 miles. The chemical trails were visible from Miami, Fla., to Texas. (USAF PHOTO)
