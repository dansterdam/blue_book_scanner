There is no photograph present in the provided image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing handwritten text that appears to be a witness statement or report.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

WITH 5 SEED WHO SEEN THE OBJECT ARE EMPLOYES OF THE U.S.G.R.D. - WORKING OUT OF FRANKLIN, OHIO ON A TRANSFER COMING FROM INLAND STEEL WITH A TRAIN JUST WEST OF BUFFINGTON, OH 

SO THEY VIEWED THE OBJECT AS IT PASSED FROM SOUTH-WEST TO A NORTH EAST DIRECTION. WHILE IN A HUMP ENGINE THEY APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 200 FT. HIGH AS WE HAD IT IN VIEW TILL IT DISAPPEARED OVER A HILL. SO THEY WEREN'T OBSTRUCTED BY ANY BUILDINGS AS THINGS AS HIGH AS 200 FT. 

IT DISAPPEAED BEHIND THE BUILDINGS OVER THE HILL. SO THAT WOULD SEEM ABOUT TOO FT. HIGH AS WE HAD IT IN VIEW TILL IT DISAPPEARED OVER THE HILL.
