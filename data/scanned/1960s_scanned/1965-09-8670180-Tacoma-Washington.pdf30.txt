Flying Saucer Report
Flying Across Mexico

The newspapers SAID: A mysterious aerial object described by eye-witnesses as "flying saucer" or "flying torpedo" was sighted over Mexico on August 24. It was seen flying at great height from the Pacific Coast to the Gulf of Mexico. The object was reported to have flown over Chihuahua, Monterrey, Tampico and the Yucatan Peninsula.

Army and air force officials said they were unable to identify the object although it was observed for hours by many people. It moved at tremendous speed and changed directions sharply.

Another group reported seeing a similar object over the Pacific some days later. Theories as to its identity included rocket-powered aircraft, a satellite or a meteorite.
