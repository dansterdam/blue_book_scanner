14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes. As I watched, it moved straight across the sky at a steady rate until out of sight. 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Circle One: None

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Circle One: N/A No

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound N/A
b. Color White, disk like star

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment, what would you have stated?
The entire object, I would say

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you observed, such as color, number of appendages, or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
