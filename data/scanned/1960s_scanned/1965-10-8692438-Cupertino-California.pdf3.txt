The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

The text on the page reads as follows:

14. Date you completed this questionnaire: March 10 1965
15. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or narrative explanation of your sighting:

After a careful analysis of the data at hand, my observations are that the object observed on the night of March 5, 1965 was a saucer-shaped craft, due to its ability to hover steady and then accelerate at a speed which was much faster than any known aircraft in existence. I cannot state categorically that it was an interplanetary spacecraft, but the object seemed to exhibit characteristics which are more in keeping with an extraterrestrial craft than any known terrestrial aircraft. The object remained in my field of vision for a period of approximately 2-3 minutes and then accelerated to a speed greatly in excess of any jet aircraft, disappearing from view within a few seconds. I am quite convinced that the object was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, satellite, or any other known aerial device. While I cannot state positively that it was of extraterrestrial origin, the performance characteristics exhibited by the object were such that I am strongly inclined to believe that it was not of this world. I am quite certain that my observation was not the product of any hallucination or mistaken identification. The object was clearly visible and I have no doubt as to the reality of what I witnessed.
