object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The image shows a bright, oval-shaped object that appeared to be glowing or illuminated. It moved rapidly and silently through the sky, changing direction at times. It was much larger and brighter than a normal aircraft, and did not resemble any known type of aircraft. The object was also observed to suddenly disappear from view. The witness was unable to provide a precise estimate of the object's speed or distance, but described it as moving at a very high rate of speed.
