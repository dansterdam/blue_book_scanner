The letter goes on at this point with an account of another witness called in the first place: I looked but there was no crash of any kind, No airplane or bird or anything, and the distance between us is less than a mile, so I would have heard or seen something if there had been a crash. As I said before, it looked to me simply like something glowing very bright and white, sort of like a star, only much bigger, that shot across the sky and then seemed to stop for a second and then go out. The only other witness lives almost directly across the street from the place on Laskey Road and she did not hear or see anything unusual either. There was no damage whatever, and the night was clear and calm, no wind or storm, and the strange light or object was only visible for a few seconds as it shot across the sky. I hope this helps to clarify what was seen and not seen. Please let me know if you need any other information.
