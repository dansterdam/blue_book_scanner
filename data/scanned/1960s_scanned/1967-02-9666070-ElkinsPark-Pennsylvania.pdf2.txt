This replies to your recent correspondence in which you mentioned our unidentified observation of 17 February 1967, and our subsequent scientific investigation.

The original negative was needed to perform a scientific investigation. Since you cannot supply the original negative data sheet and film, this office is unable to continue with the scientific investigation.
