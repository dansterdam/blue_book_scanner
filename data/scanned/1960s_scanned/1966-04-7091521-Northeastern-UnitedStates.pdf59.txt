BRIGHT OBJECT IN SKY STARTLES AREA PEOPLE

A bright green light in the sky was sighted near Utica, N.Y. on April 7, according to members of the northeastern Utica Air Force Base said after checking switchboards on the celestial.

People in the Utica and Rome, N.Y. areas reported the object. It was described as "a bright green light, like a silvery ball, with red and green flames as late as 9:38 p.m.

LEROY SEAMAN of 3 Park St, Utica, N.Y. told police he had watched the object for about 20 minutes shortly after 9 p.m. when "a bright green light, like a large star suddenly appeared in the sky and disappeared. It was at an angle about 45 to 50 degrees in the southwest horizon."

William G. White of Rome, N.Y. and James Bossick of Utica, N.Y. reported they saw the object between 8:45 and 9:30 p.m.

However, Dana DiCerge, 201 Sangertown Rd., New Hartford, N.Y. said they spotted "a rotating white light, moving from the northeast to southwest and hanging from red to white to green" at about 8:30 p.m.

JULES ABBOTT of Maynard, N.Y. told Herkimer County police the object appeared to be disc-shaped, rapidly changing colors from red, white and green.

Sighting reports after 9 p.m. also came from Oneida and Chenango counties.

CURTIS L. HEMENARY, director of the Putnam Observatory, said the descriptions led him to believe it was "a very slow meteorite" without a tail. However, he added, "if it were a meteorite, I don't see why it would be seen for such a long time."

Another spokesman at the observatory said it was probably a "satellite." He said satellites have given the same impression in the past.
