The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document describing an unidentified object that the author claims to have seen. The text describes the object as being about two miles in size, and the author expresses uncertainty about whether the objects were satellites or something else. The author mentions that the objects did not seem to be satellites based on their behavior.

Transcription of the text:

"I have seen this object twice in about two months. The size of the object I saw some time ago was big enough and I am afraid they might show any thing I have not discovered yet. The picture I have taken with a 35 mm camera has a good enlargement. But I believe that this might enter the night time or the daytime and might come over my domiciliayed with those objects. 

I know this object was not a satellite because satellites follow a straigh line way more or less described a semi-circle. Satellites don't seem this one doomed and there were no clouds in the area.

For more information, if interested please contact me.

P.D.
This about 5 miles or so from my P.R. 77. So I can't distinguish completely some conditions."
