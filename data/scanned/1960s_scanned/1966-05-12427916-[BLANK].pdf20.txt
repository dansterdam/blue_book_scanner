It was announced on April 21, 1966 by Rep. Gerald R. Ford that the United States Air Force has contracted with a group of scientists to perform an independent study of UFOs. This "in depth" analysis will commence after July 1, and will concentrate on some of the reports which remain unexplained after investigation through established Air Force procedures.
Special Briefings on UFO Activity
Periodically, the attention given to UFO activity by the public and news media has caused various high level military and civilian requests for special briefings. In October, 1956, a briefing was given by Project Blue Book personnel for Maj. Gen. Millard Lewis, Director of Air Force Intelligence (DCS/Operations). Less than a year later, on September 16, 1957, the Defense Science Board was briefed on the status of UFO activity.
In the period following the launching of Sputnik I, the number of reported UFO sightings rose spectacularly. A special briefing was conducted during January, 1958, for the Senate Committee on Government Operations (Hon. John L. McClellan, chairman). In August of the same year, a briefing was held for the Subcommittee on Atmospheric Phenomena of the House Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration (Hon. John W. McCormack, chairman).
The next request for a special briefing was not recorded by Project Blue Book until July, 1961, when Robert Smart, "chief counsel", to Congressman Joseph E. Karth, was given a status report on the UFO program.
