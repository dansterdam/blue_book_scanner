I was located in Clarksburg, West Virginia at the time of this sighting. The object sighted appeared to be from 3000 to 5000 feet in altitude and the object was flying at a rapid rate of speed, steady and level, approximately 300 mph. It was visible for about 30 seconds, disappeared over the hillside to the east.

The object appeared to be cigar-shaped, metallic in appearance and reflecting sunlight. No visible means of propulsion, no trails or exhaust visible. I know of no means of transportation which could fly at that speed and altitude without any visible means of propulsion. This sighting was witnessed by my family and myself and was observed during daylight hours. 

I have served as a radar operator in the Air Force and therefore have some familiarity with aircraft and their characteristics. This object did not resemble any aircraft that I am familiar with. I feel that this sighting is definitely of an unidentified flying object that was intelligently controlled, and because of the characteristics observed, could not have been any known type of aircraft or other man-made device.
