No effort was made to obtain reports from the area between Hibbing and Mineoquia. However, newspapers in Hibbing and Mineoquia reported that the fireball was seen from a North Central Airlines plane in the vicinity of Wisconsin Rapids. The newspaper and Chamber of Commerce, Washburn, Michigan, indicated that the sky to the north was overcast.

Mrs. ____ mentioned above, happened to be a former resident of the Ft. William Times-Journal for January 16th indicating that the Hibbing-Mineoquia fireball had been seen from the north shore of Lake Superior.

Two of the reports from the Ft. William-Port Arthur area are particular as they provide "an approximate "fix" on the point of origin of the fireball. One observer about 3 miles northeast of the Port Arthur city limits saw the fireball reach high speeds on a line just to the west of Pie Island near the intersection of Isabella and Ford Streets in Ft. William. He says the size of the fireball was diminished as though consumed in an explosion. Another observer in Ft. William, a Mr. _____ apparently sighted the location of the fireball from a different angle at about the base of the mountain. The intersection of these lines points to the west end of Pie Island and Thompson Island.

There were other reports received from within the city limits of Ft. William. A 19-year-old boy, who was skating in Mineoquia, saw the "flash from the north city limits and followed by the trail which he described as trailing a fading red glare".
