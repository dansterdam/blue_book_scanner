GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENA, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHERE IT APPEARED IN THE SKY, DIRECTION OF TRAVEL AND ANGULAR SIZE OR ELEVATION ANGLE. ALSO INDICATE COMPARISONS WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR THE MOON.

The phenomenon appeared as a streak of light moving across the front of the street, having a small bright light followed by a trail of smoke or vapor that receded in the distance. The object seemed to move rapidly and silently, as if it were some type of craft or vehicle. It is difficult to determine the exact nature of the phenomenon, whether it was a conventional object or something more unusual, since there are limited details provided in the report. The phenomena seemed to contrast with the surrounding environment, but more information would be needed to make a definitive assessment.
