TEST/UFO (M3J Quintanilla/70916/mhb/9 Nov 67)
UFO Observation & Photograph, June 23, 1967
Mr._____, Saratoga Springs, New York 12866
Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs of June 23, 1967. Lack of same identification in the photo precludes identification of the referenced objects. Our investigation cannot be complete until we examine the original negatives. If you could forward them, they may reveal new information which cannot be gleaned from the paper prints.
