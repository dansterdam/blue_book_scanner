SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: Hq USAF SAFOICC (Mrs Hunt)
    Washington, D.C. 20330

Reference the attached letter from you requesting information on unidentified flying objects and reporting an observation on the 05 July 1965. The following suggested reply:

a. Dear Mrs Hunt,
We are returning the clipping on the Antarctic observations as you requested. This particular release failed to include a statement from NORAD, an astronomical observatory in Chile, who regarded the objects as a refraction of the atmospheric body. The United States Air Force has made a survey of similar incidents in other countries, and incidents such as this are not included in Project Blue Book files.

Several important bits of data were missing from your letter regarding your observation of 6 July 1965. In order that a proper evaluation can be made, Project Blue Book has not received a previous report on this sighting.

We are also attaching a brochure on Project Blue Book which will explain the Air Force progress on this program to date.

                                FOR THE COMMANDER

                                ERIC T. de JONCKHEERE
                                Colonel, USAF
                                Deputy for Technology
                                and Subsystems
