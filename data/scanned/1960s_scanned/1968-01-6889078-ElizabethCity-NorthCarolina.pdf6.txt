Text transcribed from the document:

Here is another sighting that happened on January 27, 1968. It was making terrestrial hand-viewing, when - some events & always take my home. I watched the air liner & believe the New York, New Jersey and Washington district tell the difference between force military & small force & hope you are not thinking that NEED Glasses or anything trying to looking through the telescope the cause up white smoke from the seeing. The witness again seen a strange sighting, they said this was crazy they were drunk. I told my year young that telescope something this object was about 7-800 ft. in the air & it was flying the object.
