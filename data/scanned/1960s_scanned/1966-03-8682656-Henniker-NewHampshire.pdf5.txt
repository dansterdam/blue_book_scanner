The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and some text. The diagram shows a compass rose with degrees marked on it, and there is a sketch depicting the movement of an object or objects in the sky. The text instructs the viewer to imagine and draw the motion of the object or objects, place markers on the compass rose, and discuss how many objects were observed and their arrangement.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. THEN GOT SOME DISTANCE AND REPPEARED BUT OTHERS.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 7 AT THE MOST AT ONE TIME. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling. ADDITIONAL ONE DISAPPEARED WHEN IT REPRESENTED.
