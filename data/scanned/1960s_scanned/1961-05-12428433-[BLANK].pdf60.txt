There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a technical document discussing "Inflatable Structures in Space". The text in the document discusses the potential for creating large, reliable inflatable structures for use in space applications, and outlines a research and development plan related to this concept.

The text in the document is as follows:

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
It looks like this system could go into extremely large structures and make them into a reliable dimension that can do a job for us in space. This inflation of the structure is good application of thin films and full and can also show good results.
(Four foot diameter collector model displayed.)
Dr. Ross: This was a little inflatable and rigilized in space. I think this gives us an idea of the things we can do. If we go back to the slides, I will show you what we are basically doing.
Figure 28 shows that in order to use this material you have to consider every thing from the basic material and conditions all the way down through to the actual application. Each one of these things as I mentioned has to be designed. You can't just take a piece of material off the shelf. You have to design each of the structures for the specific application.

ASSEMBLY AND STATION EXPANSION AND IN-SPACE REPAIR

Figures 29 and 30 show that in-house we are defining three areas, those having to do with mathematics, aeronotics and the third area, which is the rigidizing, once the thin films have been cemented into theories and hard structures. The thing that is different about this and hard structures, is that we know have to develop equations and consider some things that we didn't have in conventional hard structures.
In a hard structure, once it is deflected beyond a certain point, you can go back to the original configuration. We have to set up some new formulas and things that we can use.
