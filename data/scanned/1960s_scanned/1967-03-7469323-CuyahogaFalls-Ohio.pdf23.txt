Case of M. A ------_, class no. ------_
We were home alone and ------ and I saw a light in the sky which was very strange and hard to describe. It was an oblong shape and and was hovering for some time. We went out on the porch to get a better view. It was reddish-orange in color and appeared to be flashing or pulsating. After a few minutes it suddenly accelerated and took off at a high rate of speed, disappearing over the horizon. It was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. The whole event lasted 5-10 minutes. We were very puzzled by what we saw and would like to know if you have any explanation for this. Any information would be appreciated. Please let me know if you need any further details."
