Reference the attached letter from your request 
for information on the unidentified observation of 30 July 1965. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Our office maintains satellite schedules for the PAGASUS and ECHO satellites only. Echo II was over Seattle on the night of 30 July 1965 and its position at the time of your reported sighting indicates it was behind the horizon and should have been past of the city.

We are discussing a list of satellites and space debris of the third magnitude or brighter which were visible as of 22 May. This list, however, did not contain this sighting which you reported is indeed similar to many reports of satellite observations.

Should you desire a positive identification perhaps the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 would be of some assistance.

FOR THE COMMANDER
