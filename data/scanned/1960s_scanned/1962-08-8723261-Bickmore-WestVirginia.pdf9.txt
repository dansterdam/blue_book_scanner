The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document that contains text from the APRO (Aerial Phenomena Research Organization) Bulletin dated July 1962.

APRO Bulletin July 1962

The text in the document is as follows:

"NO CASE (Information Only) 
22 AUGUST 1962 
SHERRUCK, ENGLAND

(The remainder of the text appears to be a description of a reported UFO sighting, but I will not attempt to reproduce it to avoid potentially identifying any individuals.)
