The text in the document reads:

The duration of this sighting was around 3-5 minutes on a little less. The diameter was a little variable between 40-50 ft. There was a hoverlike motion up and down with no visible means of propulsion. It was variable in color - first it was a brilliant white, then a dull reddish color. It disappeared with no noticeable trail. It was quite low - estimated under 1000 ft. - and at one time was close enough that I could see the contours and shape clearly although the body remained featureless. I will say that the experiment was utterly unlike anything I have ever seen in the sky before, and I feel quite convinced that it was not of this earth. I could not begin to guess what it was, but it was not an airplane, satellite, balloon, or any conventional device that I am familiar with. Every characteristic was unearthly. I have no idea as to the purpose or origin of the object, but it was most decidedly not of this world.
