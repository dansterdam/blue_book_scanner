Flying Object, Seen Widely, May Be Satellite
A glittering, glowing object spotted over Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin yesterday was not a weather balloon, as was reported earlier, but more likely a satellite, according to the Federal Aviation Agency.

"The object, since the Tyler balloon was believed to have fallen, was spotted around 10:40 p.m. EDT and was described by observers as a glittering, glowing object. It was sighted over Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Columbus said it was a satellite."

Early speculation that it might be the 12-foot balloon satellite launched by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Sonic Laboratory in Pennsylvania and that it was re-entering the earth's atmosphere at the same time reports were coming in far to the west in Ohio were denied by the Weather Bureau.

The Weather Bureau said the object sighted was almost certainly a satellite. They said that several hundred sightings of the object were reported to them and that it was seen from several states.

The chief meteorologist at the Columbus Weather Bureau said it was a usual routine for the bureau to receive many reports through leases. Descriptions by others who watched the object were similar, he said, indicating it was the same object spotted in various locations.

Reports on the color varied widely, he said, ranging from white to orange, depending on where and whether it was day, dusk or night when it was sighted.
