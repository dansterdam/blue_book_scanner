TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
JOHN GLENN AND HIS DAY OF MIRACLES
Like all of you, I am proud to be an American. I feel I am your representative for all of the activities related to this program. I am highly honored and I feel that I am your representative, as I represent all the various scientific, technical, and administrative personnel back into the space race with a program and a project which I think is of enormous significance to the United States, and to all the people of the world. Contrasted with similar Russian flights, it was a great achievement, and all of us who have had a part in it may well be proud. Woodrow Wilson once said: "The great fact about our day is that the world is smaller than it used to be in my time, or in the time of any man who has recently lived." Technically, it is justified and required the long labor, development and dedication of many scientists and technicians of the U.S. space program into which the Nation has so intelligently poured its resources. For man himself, it produced some valuable lessons, gained through the astronauts Gagarin and Titov, the world knows much more with certainty how man can live and work in space. Based on this period (Glenn's) early experiment, space is not the vacuum. The body did not disintegrate, as was some of the prognostication. The man did not blow over the controls, himself and we very thankfully found that man's genius and versatility, answering the critics who have added information. This flight, I hope, added a bit more.

JOHN GEORGE LEMARE: "I do not believe that God ever intended to exclude so man that man could find one for himself."
