Dear Major Hoisington

I am enclosing a report on the sighting of what may have been a metallic or metallic-looking object. It was observed on 8 June 1965 at approximately 8:50 P.M. from the backyard of my residence at 29 Maple Street, Bedford, Ohio.

The object appeared to be hovering at an estimated altitude of 500 to 600 feet above the ground. It was visible for about 5 to 7 minutes and then suddenly disappeared. During the time it was observed, the object appeared to be rotating or moving back and forth. It emitted no sound and gave off no visible exhaust or flame. I was able to observe the object without the use of binoculars or other optical aids. The weather was clear at the time.

I am curious to know if this sighting was reported by any other observers in the area and whether your office has received any other reports of similar objects being seen in this vicinity. I would appreciate any information you can provide.

Sincerely,
[Name Redacted]

P.S. Under no circumstances do I wish my name to appear in any public release of this information. I trust this will be held in strict confidence.
