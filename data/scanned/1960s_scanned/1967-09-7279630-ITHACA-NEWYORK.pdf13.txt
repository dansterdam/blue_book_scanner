The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, likely describing the visual observations and analysis of a reported UFO sighting.

OCRED TEXT:

Count illustrates in Ex. 1 is probably too small...the writer seems to feel the object or objects observed made to take a visual count (of the objects nearest dim. "3") and size the half his field of view at nine seen. In other words the count of the objects suggests dim. "3" but the siste of 9 seen. "In conclusion, the total dimensions on length of dimension "d" the writer made a mechanical estimate, approximately 3 by 10 feet. This might vary possibly from three times the length of the short dimension as the writer has not quite certain. The point of the dimensions of the object noted by the observer, which is the distance nearest the observer, is approximately 800 yards. The angular distance which the object subtends the observer, is approximately the size of a dime held at the mentioned distance at which a dime is the distance nearest. The writer can first state he thinks the two dimensions are really approximately square, and the object actually composed of circular white discs.

Perspective View Overall From Observer's Vantage Point: An illustration made for this reader's mind's eye or illustrative initial views are not for purposes of dimensions to conclusions but these views should serve the general impression of the figure as actually composed of circular white discs.
