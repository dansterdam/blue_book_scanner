Text from the document:

SITUATION: At approximately 0030 hours on 8 October 1965, a telephone call was received from the Provost Marshal's Office, Edwards AFB, California, reporting that a bright light had been sighted in the sky approximately 10 miles northeast of the base. The light was described as a very brilliant, sharply defined object which hovered for several minutes and then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. The object was observed by several people including the Security Police and was reported to be approximately 1/4 mile in diameter.

INVESTIGATION: On the night of 8 October 1965, this writer and the Base Intelligence Officer proceeded to the area of Edwards AFB, California, where the unidentified object had been sighted. Upon arrival at the base, we were immediately taken to the Provost Marshal's Office where several eyewitness statements were obtained. The witnesses, all of whom were military personnel, stated that at approximately 0030 hours they had observed a very bright light in the sky approximately 10 miles northeast of the base. The light was described as being sharply defined and hovering for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view. One witness stated that the object appeared to be approximately 1/4 mile in diameter.

This writer and the Base Intelligence Officer then proceeded to the area where the object had been sighted and conducted a thorough search of the area. No evidence of the object was found and no additional witnesses were located.

CONCLUSION: Based on the eyewitness statements and the lack of any physical evidence, this incident is classified as unidentified. The object observed by the witnesses does not correspond to any known aircraft or natural phenomenon. The rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object also indicates that it was not a conventional aircraft. Therefore, this incident must be classified as a UFO.
