"I was out at a high altitude when I saw this. It appeared to be a very large, almost round craft, with lights on it. It appeared to be cruising along quite rapidly, and made no sound whatever. There were several other people who saw the same thing. When the object came into view, it was at an extremely high altitude, and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. I watched it for several minutes, and it appeared to be crossing the sky in a straight line, and going in an easterly direction. I would appreciate very much if you could see I that this is investigated.
