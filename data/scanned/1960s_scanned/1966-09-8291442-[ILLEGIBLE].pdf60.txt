35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The tail that remained constant began with a point and expanded into a more rounded shape as it traveled with the main portion. It seemed to be trailing vapor streams. As the main portion of the light slowed and came to a stop, the tail continued to travel away for quite some time. The light then appeared to suddenly collapse in on itself and disappear. I thought we must be dealing with some type of aircraft or craft. The movement and behavior of the light was very unusual and unlike anything I have ever seen before. My wife called my attention to the sight and we both observed it intently for approximately 2-3 minutes before it disappeared. It seemed to be traveling at a very rapid rate of speed and then just stopped moving and collapsed. I would appreciate any information you can provide concerning this sighting.
