There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

We were leaving the town to come home at about 9:15, and as we drove along the lower end of Jeffery Road we saw what we thought was a bright star. We soon realized that it was coming towards us and came to be a size of approximately 10 to 12 feet in diameter. It appeared to be a solid object, glowing and metallic in appearance, and it moved off at a different direction and we got in the car and came home.
