There is no photograph present in this scanned document. However, the text contains a detailed technical examination and analysis of the impact holes and the original holes observed, discussing aspects such as the edges, flow characteristics, and weight involved in the incident. The text also mentions attempts to reproduce the burn-mark on the object.

Examination of the results of the impact that showed significant differences between the impact holes and the northeast original hole, which was the most clearly delineated. The impact holes had sharp edges and seemed to indicate that the object had passed through the rocks and been pushed into the holes. There were no signs of sheared-through rocks in the northeast original hole.

Around the northeast original hole was a rim of tar which had apparently oozed up as the hole was made; the impact holes, on the other hand, showed sharp edges with no signs of flow of the tar. The impact holes were full of white powder from shattered rocks; none was seen in the original holes, although 36 hours had passed before arrival of the investigator, and foreign matter had been blown or pushed into the holes.

The indications apparently are that the original holes were made at considerably lower velocity than the impact holes, which means in turn that the weight involved had to be larger than 81 pounds per leg (correcting for depth of original holes). At zero velocity the question breaks down, and because of the flow characteristics or tar the higher weights (going with the lower velocities) should be corrected downward. A more exact analysis is left to those better acquainted with hardness tests. Nevertheless the indications are that a rather heavy object (such as the end of a pickaxx) making a high-velocity impact with the road.

The second test involved attempts to reproduce the burn-mark on the object.
