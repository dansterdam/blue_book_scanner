The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - 
b. Color - Hazy - Red

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object would have been covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? About 1/2 inch

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
