Dear Sir,

I appreciate your accepting a copy of my original report on the sighting made by your neighbor in this area. I hope this report gives you a good picture of what transpired that evening as your neighbor saw it. I have tried to give a good many details as possible. If you have any additional questions, do not hesitate to write me again as I am very interested in this type of phenomena and will be glad to assist further if I can.

Since I do not know your neighbor personally, and have no other information than what is contained in this report, I cannot comment in any detail on his reliability or reputation. However, I have found this witness to be quite straightforward, without any apparent tendency to embellish or exaggerate his story. He impressed me as an honest and intelligent man who simply wanted to report what he had seen, without any ulterior motive.

I would be most interested to learn if you have any other similar reports from your area that you could share with me. Such information is always helpful in determining the extent and nature of the UFO activity in a given locality. And of course, should you or your neighbor have any other questions or observations to communicate, please feel free to do so.

Thank you again for your cooperation. I look forward to hearing from you further on this matter.

Sincerely yours,
