We arrived at Cambridge, Illinois, and proceeded to the Henry County Sheriff's Office to interview witnesses. Miss Katharine Andrews stated that her attention was caught by the peculiar lighting arrangement of what she thought were an aircraft. Since the object in question was at rather high altitude, it was not possible that her recall of the light positions and maneuvers was entirely accurate. The objects were observed for approximately 15 minutes; however, we are unable to reach any definite conclusion as to the nature of the sighting.

The plastic clothing bags were found in the Monmouth area. These bags appear to have some connection with the objects sighted. They constitute a platform for the hot air generator. The generator has been found to be empty but it seems feasible that it could have been used to lift the balloons carrying the objects. The contents of the bags, which appear to be some kind of small containers, have been found in the Galesburg area. These, in addition to the plastic bags and air vehicles, most probably accounted for most all the sightings.

As a result of the investigation, it is our considered opinion that the U.S. air forces reporting media unwittingly causes a type of mass hysteria to those concerned with sightings. Lost film observers appear to be extremely reliable but have a strong desire to see something extraordinary. It is reasonable to assume that this sighting was a managed attraction to lure toconfidence skeptical witnesses. There were no unidentified objects involved in the Galesburg area incident.
