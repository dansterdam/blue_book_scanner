"Last night just after midnight
the wife (name not clear) phoned the office to say that something was going on outside their home in the country. I got the call about 1:15 or 1:20 AM. I phoned my department to have a car check it out. The police officer called back shortly and said there was nothing unusual going on and that the wife had decided to sit up the rest of the night. I asked him if he had talked to the wife and he said "No, I just made a drive around the place." Meanwhile I had dressed and gotten into my car to go out and take a look, but the officer called back before I left, so I decided to wait until morning to check it out myself.

When I got there about 8:00 AM the wife said she had seen several lights in the sky which had been moving in an erratic manner, some zig-zagging and some making sharp turns. She said one object hovered over the house for some time and then suddenly shot straight up and out of sight. She said it gave off a brilliant white light that seemed to illuminate the whole countryside. This lasted about 15-20 minutes, and she became quite upset and called the office. She said she did not see or hear any conventional aircraft in the area.

I made a complete search of the entire section and could find no signs of any landing or impact on the ground. There were no physical traces and the wife was the only witness. The weather was clear and visibility was excellent. This seems to be another of those sightings that defies any reasonable explanation based on our current knowledge. I will forward this report to Project Blue Book for further evaluation and possible investigation if they feel it is warranted."
