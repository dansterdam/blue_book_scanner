The text of the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 67-49
DATE OF REPORT 7 June 1967
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION Camelback Mountain, Arizona
DATE 30 March 1967
PHOTOGRAPHY
AF - 
IR -
QUALITY Poor
P NRS 35mm color slide, 1 B&W enlargement

1. PURPOSE: This report serves to answer Work Order Number 67-64 in which it was requested to identify or determine the characteristics of an unidentified object in a color slide submitted by Mr. Phoenix, Arizona.

2. ANALYSIS: In examining the photography it was noted that while the lights of the city indicated a triple exposure (due to camera movement or vibration) the subject point of interest produced a single exposure and therefore could not be a stationary object. The reason for this conclusion is that (a) if the object were stationary the lights of the city should also have been stationary and (b) if the object were moving, the lights of the city should have been blurred by the second exposure.

3. CONCLUSION: Based on the determination of the mode of operation of the camera, it is the opinion of this office that the object recorded on the film was actually a moving object, and that it was not a stationary object as some researchers had concluded.
