The image contains a sketched illustration of a UFO sighting, including a compass-style diagram and instructions for the observer to draw their own illustration. There is no actual photograph present in this page of the document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are on the earth (horizon) when you first saw the object. How high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "X" on the axis (skyline) where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place a "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
