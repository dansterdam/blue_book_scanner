Phone Co.
Base-Rate
Change OK'd

Nearby - the New York Tel. Co. has applied to the Public Service Commission for a change in rates - they want to increase the monthy phone service charge in the Metropolitan area by 20c. i'nd in the suburb. areas by 10c. They say the. cause of this is the tremendous increase in the number of phones in use and the constantly increasing costs of operation and maintenance.

Some of the figures given are:
1949 - 3,560,000 phones
1959 - 6,000,000 phones
And altho the number has gone up 66 2/3%, the rates have not been changed for 10 years.

When they get thru, our phone bill will be a little more. But we should, perhaps, consider ourselves lucky. In England the charges for phone service are much higher than here.

Does this sound like the old story of higher costs and so higher prices? Most things go up or change OK these days. The public usually has to pay the bill.
