UFO Observation, 26 October 1966

1. This replies to your correspondence of August 31, 1967 on the identification of the slide was examined by photo experts at Wright-Patterson AFB where the following results:

a. The cause of the image on the film cannot be positively identified. The slide appears to show 3 images or dark spots or circles, which may have been caused by several streaks. These streaks are part of the image and are not described in the emulsion. A comparison of the slide and the color print shows somewhat different and possibly additional streaks not visible on the emulsion. Also, the water bubble does not appear to be the source. The original color material is not available. Without the original material, detailed analysis into the possible causes of the imagery cannot be made.

2. No further investigation into your observation will be made as your findings concur in October 1966 and since there were no other data or witnesses to support further inquiry into this instance.

3. Enclosed are your slide, print and one enlargement. Thanks for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
