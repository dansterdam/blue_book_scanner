There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document with text that appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to extract and output the text from the document:

"Met WTTR Millers. The object as seen on the radar display was a continuous patten, could be of a maneuver, 4 miles south of Battle Creek.

It is concluded that the object of this sighting was weather. Made compar[is]on."
