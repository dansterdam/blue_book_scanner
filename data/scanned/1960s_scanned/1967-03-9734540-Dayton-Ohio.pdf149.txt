Talking about it again gave me an impulse to write about it as I more intensly remember some additional details. It happened near my home outside of city limits about 3-4 miles in a remote area. The object was silent, oval in shape and appeared to be a dull silvery color. It seemed to hover about 4-500 feet abov e the ground for 3-4 minutes. Then it began moving at a rapid rate of speed and disappeared. I was amazed at the time and remember thinking I'd never seen anything like it before. It's one of those things I can still picture in my mind even after all these years. I realize there are logical explanations, but this was very real to me at the time and I still can't quite account for what I saw. I don't believe I was overly excited or imagining things. I was simply an adult observer w ith no agenda trying to report what I saw as accurately as possible. I hope this added information is of some use to you. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
