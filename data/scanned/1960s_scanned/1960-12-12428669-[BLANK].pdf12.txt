DAVIS: Colonel, what caused the return on the radar scope?
COLONEL: Colonel, what about all the charges and speculation that the Air Force has secret documents on file that are conclusions to the UFO situation and refuses to release the information?
COLONEL TACKER: This is pure rubbish, sir. There are no such documents. I've gone through the files. I've looked thoroughly for any such Air Force conclusions. I've never found anything to this effect and I'd like to add that the Air Force regulation on this subject, 200-2, paragraph 13 is to be exact, cites specifically that UFO sightings will not be classified.
DAVIS: What other countries have frequent flying saucer reports?
COLONEL TACKER: Well, just from my experience and reading many of the reports from our own Aero-Space Technical Intelligence Center, I would say that, really, the countries that have most of the reports would be Australia, New Zealand, England and the South American or Spanish-speaking countries.
DAVIS: What about Russia?
COLONEL TACKER: That's a difficult question. We have received on occasion through our own sources over there, people stationed within Russia at various times, second-hand reports of the fact that UFO's or flying saucers have been seen there, but naturally we receive no direct result from Russian authorities on this subject.
DAVIS: Well, do Russian scientists tell you anything about their investigations of these things? Do they do anything about these reports in Russia that you know of?
COLONEL TACKER: Not that I know of. Said, no.
CORRICK: Colonel Tacker, since the Air Force has begun investigating these sightings have these reports increased or decreased?
