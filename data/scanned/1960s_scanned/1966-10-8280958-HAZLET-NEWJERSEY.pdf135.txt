COX SIGHTING
Persons making sighting: Roy Cox, Rutherford, Phone 698 2314, Age 39
Ford M-G Machine Maintenance Man, Special Training: Electronics School
Date of sighting: Oct. 6, 1966 between 10:30 and 11:00 PM
Locality of sighting: On Bridge road 2/1 9 miles south of Somerville. 
Sky conditions: Clear, starry, no moon, a bright crescent moon.
Total time seen: 30 or 20 seconds at most.
Narrative:
A witness who has a citizen band radio in his car was driving home bound on Highway 22 and had passed through the traffic light from the south at about 300 or 400 feet and an estimated 1/2 mile away from the object. As the witness approached a small hill south of the bridge and crested the hill, he noticed a light above the top of a large house on a hill south of the bridge and discovered that the object had made a sharp turn to return eastward over the top of the hill. And as he looked up, the highway about 150 yards down.
The object was described as being round, about 6 feet in diameter, of a whitish or bluish color, brighter than the stars and moon and with no visible means of propulsion. It made no sound and was moving at a high speed, fast enough to take it out of sight in about 20 to 30 seconds. The witness said he made an effort to keep it in sight as long as possible but lost it as it went over the hill. He believes the object may have returned to the point from which it came as he saw no trail. The object showed no trail, no exhaust and no markings.
Note: The fact that the witness driving object troughed had to be sure in the sighting. He seemed to be uncertain of what he saw, though he firmly believes in them.
