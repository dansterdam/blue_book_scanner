Transcription of the text in the document:

"noted arrived here. 

That's all, thanks for listening, 
and I assure you that if you
are to investigate you'll find
it's not a crackpot.

Yours truly,
[redacted]

P.S. - My name is [redacted]. I'm surely not the only one
who saw something that's what I saw
about 20 years ago

P.S. - My address in case you want it:
[redacted]
Chicago 60646 Illinois"
