The image contains three sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the trajectory of an object in the sky, with the text instructing the reader to place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon. The second and third sketches appear to be examples of how to complete the larger sketch, with one showing a more compact object and the other showing a more elongated object.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) where you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketches as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
