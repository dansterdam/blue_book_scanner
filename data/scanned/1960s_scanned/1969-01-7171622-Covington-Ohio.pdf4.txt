NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 'B' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WHEN LAST SEEN. 

POSITION FOR SIGHTING THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN - CONNECT THE 'A' AND 'B' POINTS WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OR CHANGE IN POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON. IT IS DESIRABLE TO PROVIDE AS ACCURATE A SKETCH AS POSSIBLE THAT WILL GRAPHICALLY SHOW MATERIAL CHANGES IN DIRECTION, SPEED, ETC. FOR EXAMPLE, AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
