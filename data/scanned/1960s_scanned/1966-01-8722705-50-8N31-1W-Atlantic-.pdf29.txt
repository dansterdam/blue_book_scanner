There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON?
IN BUILDING
AS DRIVER   AS PASSENGER
IN CAR
IN AIRCRAFT   AS PILOT   AS PASSENGER   
ALSO
IF YOU WERE IN A VEHICLE, WHICH WAY WERE YOU FACING?
NORTH
EAST 
SOUTH
WEST
EXPLAIN SUCH MOVEMENT OR DIRECTION:
HOW MUCH OTHER TRAFFIC WAS THERE?
DID YOU NOTICE ANY AIRPLANES?   YES   NO    IF YES, DESCRIBE THEM:

HOW LONG WAS THE PHENOMENON IN SIGHT?
LESS THAN 1 MINUTE   CERTAIN OF TIME   NOT VERY SURE
1-5 MINUTES   QUITE SURE
OVER 5 MINUTES   JUST A GUESS
