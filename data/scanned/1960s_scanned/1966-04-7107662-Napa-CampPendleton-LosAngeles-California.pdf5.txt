The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document that is part of a Project Blue Book report.

The text in the document reads:

"Statement of SGT William C CERNANS 159-108-2
At or about 0326, 23 April 1966. I observed a light green, oblong object in the sky traveling in a northeast direction that was changing shapes and flashing out.
FD 2-5* called in that the sod it clears might disappear as it will return. That area 2-5* was the normal spinner.
This statement is the best of my knowledge.

William C Cernans
SGT 159-108-2"
