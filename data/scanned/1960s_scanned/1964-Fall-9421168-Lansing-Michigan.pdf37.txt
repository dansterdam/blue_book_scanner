DEAR BORN OBSERVATORY,
NORTH WESTENGTON CALIFORNIA 9210
MRS. SAN JOSE OF CALIF. 95103

I came directly here.
Because of the conflicting dates I must be sure that all my data is accurate.
The exact time of sighting was at about 7:05 P.M. when I was out in the yard and it was still daylight. The object came down from the east. It moved slowly and appeared to be round or cigar-shaped. It was dark in color, perhaps bluish-gray. It hovered and maneuvered for several minutes before moving off to the west and disappearing. I watched it the entire time through binoculars. It seemed to be about the size of a small plane, perhaps 30 to 40 feet in length. There was no sound associated with the object.
I realize the date may be somewhat questionable as I record keeping has never been my strong point, but I am quite certain that this sighting occurred on the evening of July 7, 1964 in San Jose, California. I would appreciate any information you can provide regarding this sighting, or any similar reports from the area around that time.
Thank you for your assistance.
Sincerely,
