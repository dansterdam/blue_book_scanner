WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
A very bright object flying on a relatively straight path with bright beams of light - its shape was completely unfamiliar. Nor had I ever observed a flying object completely luminous.

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Out of view behind trees.

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
Twice it appeared to move behind small clouds. When it finally passed out of view, there were trees between myself and the object.
