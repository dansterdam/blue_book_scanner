On July 15, at 11:50 p.m., I saw something for which I have no explanation. It is difficult to describe because it was quite unlike anything I have seen before. It happened while I was doing some routine chores on the farm on which I live on the outskirts of Montville, Ohio. As I was walking along, I noticed two bright lights appear in the sky over the tree tops which are quite tall pine trees. At first I thought it was a small plane, but I then noticed the lights pasted between two large cherry trees on either side of the driveway. The lights passe between the trees, as if in low-level flight, and only about three to five feet from the ground, as best I can judge. They were about twenty-five or thirty feet apart. Unfortunately, because of the darkness, I could not make out any shape or outline of the object carrying the lights. Soon the lights disappeared behind the trees, and I could hear a sound of a higher pitch than those audible to the human ear. The lights seemed to be about three inches in diameter, and dim at the edges, whereas the centers were quite bright. (Colonel N. M. GRANNIS, Montville, O.). This is only one of the many unpublished things that we are frequently told through our appearance on the Randy Show. Unfortunately, lack of space prevents us from publishing the others at this time.
