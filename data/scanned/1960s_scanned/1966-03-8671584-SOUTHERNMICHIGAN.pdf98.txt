HILLSDALE, MICH. (UPI) - Several witnesses, including a deputy sheriff and a student nurse, reported sighting a glowing, hat-shaped object hovering over Hillsdale, Mich., for several hours Tuesday night. 
The Air Force dispatched its "saucer squad" to investigate the reported UFO.
The witnesses said they watched the object shine brightly, change colors and move rapidly up and down, hovering motionless at times before disappearing. Searchers found no trace of the object.
Mrs Emily Boeri, for seven years a civil defense director, said the object displayed "unusual brightness" and was larger than a full moon. She said it moved away and dodged an air port beacon beam before disappearing.
Among the other witnesses were Allen Pfaffenberger, 31, of Hillsdale, who was the first to see the object, and Earl Bolster, 29, a student nurse at Hillsdale Community College. The Air Force said it would investigate the report.
