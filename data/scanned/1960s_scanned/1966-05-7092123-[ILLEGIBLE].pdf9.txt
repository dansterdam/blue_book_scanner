The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire or form with various questions about the observed object.

Transcribing the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
(The object was lost to sight and disappeared behind trees)

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle one:) Yes - No - Don't Know. 
IF you answered YES, describe what happened:
(The object moved behind trees)

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one:) Yes - No - Don't Know.
IF you answered YES, describe what happened:
(The object moved in front of trees)

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None
b. Color: White or light gray

18. We wish to know the angular size of the object. Hold a match stick or pencil in line with a known object, and measure how much of the object would have been covered by the match head. About 1/10 of a degree.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the details such as size, proportions, etc., and especially indicate traits or special features of the object. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
