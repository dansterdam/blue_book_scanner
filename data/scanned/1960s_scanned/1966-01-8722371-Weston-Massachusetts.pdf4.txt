Transcribed text:

This is an interview with ____ on January 20, 1966.

On this interesting sighting -- let's go through the thing -- January 7th, 1966, you were -- supposed you say it in my own words and that's what you said and it was 6:55 p.m. and were just coming home to supper, Kansas. 

Are you speaking of the first event?
Yes, the first event.

Well, the first event -- actually, it was about in the house -- changing my clothes. When the children sighted the object at 6:55.  

And it was Winny who sighted it first.
Yes. 

And he came in then yelling "There's a flying saucer outside!"
That is, the youngest boy came in -- Arthur.

And he say -- something -- I forget to ask before -- did he say anything about how long he had been watching this thing move?
It couldn't have been more than 3 minutes... about 3 minutes later when they came in.

And it wasn't more than 3 minutes seen. And it wasn't more than 3 minutes later when they came in.

Did he indicate where he saw it when he first saw it?
Later on, when we were watching the object, he indicated that it had been at an altitude of about 500 and I would estimate an azimuth of --

Two-ten 3-- in the southwest?
That is, yes.

So the local are that it covered would have been about what, through the two periods of motion? 
Yes.
I would imagine approximately 50Â°.
That is then, as I see it, broken up into two parts.

The first line that he saw it coming from -- say, the south--
due south.
