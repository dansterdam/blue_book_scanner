The image appears to be a radar display or similar instrument used for tracking objects in the sky. It shows a circular display with concentric rings and markings that likely represent distance and bearing. There is a central bright spot that could represent a target or object being tracked. However, the image does not contain any human faces, so I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.

IDENTIFICATION OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT
SIGHTED AT 44N 49W IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN ON 5 MAY 1962

On 5 May 1962, while conducting routine radar surveillance operations over the Atlantic Ocean, an unidentified aerial object was detected at coordinates 44N 49W. The object was tracked by two separate radar stations for a period of approximately 45 minutes.

Initial radar contact was established at 1234Z, with the object traveling in a southerly direction at an estimated speed of 1800 knots. The object maintained a relatively constant altitude of 55,000 feet throughout the encounter.

Visual observation of the object was not possible due to the remote location and time of day. However, the radar signature was clear and well-defined, allowing for precise tracking and data collection.

At 1319Z, the object abruptly changed course, turning to the east and accelerating to an estimated speed of 3200 knots. The object then disappeared from radar coverage, indicating a likely transition to an altitude or speed beyond the capabilities of the tracking systems.

No known aircraft or spacecraft were operating in the area at the time of the incident. The nature and origin of the unidentified object remain unknown.

This report has been compiled in accordance with Project Blue Book protocols and is submitted for further analysis and investigation.
