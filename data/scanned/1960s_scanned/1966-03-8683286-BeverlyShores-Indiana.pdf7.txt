Text from the document:

Then when I looked at it again, it was next to another two seconds. So I knew it was moving but it did not appear to be.

Next, it seemed landed on the ground about 3 feet east of where I was standing in the window of my home. 

It was a circular round silver looking light with long lighted points all around it. I could not see anyone who might be operating it.

Then, at 6:30 AM it raised steadily and flew across the street and landed on the power line of the service line in the back again. Then it rose in the air again above the trees and flew east until it appeared to be above Michigan City.
