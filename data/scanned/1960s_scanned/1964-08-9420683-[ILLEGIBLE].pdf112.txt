Dear Capt. Quintanilla:

I am hoping you furnish me with information on some things my family and I have made in recent weeks.
The objects we have seen appear to be silent and unusual, but upon closer examination we note that they are moving, and in the space distance.
It is impossible to estimate the altitute at which they are visible, because we have no idea of their size. As it grew,   the objects seem to be far away, but live never known stars to move, and if, indeed, they were as near as their brilliance at times would indicate, they would be flying at tremendous speed.
