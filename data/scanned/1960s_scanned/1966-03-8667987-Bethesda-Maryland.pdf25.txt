The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, filled with handwritten text.

As an OCR system, the text in the document is as follows:

I was in back yard of house, watching the sky other costs, when I noticed UFO coming up Southwest between. It stayed motionless for a few minutes, then turned on its axis and headed south that high. The UFO advanced very swiftly, it was higher, by far, than least airplane. There were no blinking lights or it. Since it would move momentarily, a second or two at time, I dount seriously, if it wore a satellite, since the color & size did not charge as it appears on binoculars, dont know if the "jet exhaust" explanation will work. I gave very seldom hear able to get a lot better watch out, since there is no real stamp usually dont seriously, if it were swarp gas.

(Rader - made comment that the was was not as he has seen on TV, and it was over some small towns and magnetic AIRCRAFT instruments distracted. I am now retired, I do not have to substantiate with the partly live).

No UFO approached neatly a van into our house, to tell my.
