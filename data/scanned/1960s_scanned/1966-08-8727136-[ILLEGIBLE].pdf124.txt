Inquiries - Objects in the Sky at Night
Project 10073 Agency
Washington, D.C.

Although this inquiry may be misaddressed, please assist me in directing it properly.

I would like any information that might explain the following occurrence: 
On the night of August 15, 1962, this writer and a companion, while in the vicinity of the Cassidy Lake Trailer Park, located approximately 8 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., observed an unidentified object in the sky. It was stationary at first, then seemed to be moving, and finally remained stationary again. It gave off an intense white light, was quite large, and was observed for approximately 10 minutes. Its actions were noticed by several other people in the area, who stopped their vehicles to observe it. After the object remained stationary for a time, it suddenly blinked out and was gone.

I include with this letter a rough map, or chart, that may further elucidate the occurrence. Could your agency explain what we observed? Could you tell us what it was? We would appreciate any information you might be able to provide concerning this incident (to our knowledge) as there seems to be some related matters of which we are unaware. 

If you cannot supply this information, or venture a guess, then we might conclude that this letter is sincere, and that we feel your group that we describe as having a somewhat detached attitude, regards such matters as unimportant. We sincerely solicit your prompt reply.

Sincerely,

[ILLEGIBLE]
