Dear Mr. -,

The Office of the Chief of Staff has asked this office to reply to your letter concerning flying objects over South Dakota.

Since no case is considered verified, the sightings are being filed for information purposes only. However, the information is deemed necessary.

Regarding the Columbine sightings, our files do not have any cases concerning the "arm of a figure" that was reportedly seen. Unless additional information is available, we have no data to substantiate this claim.

I trust the inclosures will give you a better understanding.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM J. LOOTADOO
