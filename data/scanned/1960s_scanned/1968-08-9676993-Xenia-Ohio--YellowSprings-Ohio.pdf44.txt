The image contains two sketches or illustrations, but no photographs. The first sketch is a compass rose with directions labeled, and the instructions state to place an "X" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a "B" on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon. The second and third sketches appear to be landscape scenes, possibly depicting the view from the observer's perspective.
