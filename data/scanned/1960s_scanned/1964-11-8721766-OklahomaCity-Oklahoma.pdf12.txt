The field in the 4400 block near Southwest 32nd and Santa Fe, Oklahoma City, Friday night. Two boys, Dale Johnson and Steve Barnes, found the pieces of "meteoritic" material in the field where the "falling star" apparently fell to the earth in Southwest Oklahoma City Friday night. Dale Johnson, 12, said he saw the "object" fall about 9:15 p.m. Barnes, 13, said he saw the "object" about the same time. They said they found the piece* of "meteoritic" material in the field Saturday. The "falling star" was not seen by several persons from the Planetarium staff members who called to examine the material, but they indicated they had found the material had been artificially burned, as if from intense heat. Thompson, an amateur astronomer and geologist, said Sunday: Two pieces, one square and one irregular, "about the size of a fifty-cent piece," were found together in the field. He said this could be one piece that was broken into two pieces. Thompson said he planned to take a cross section of the material for examination, and that even larger chunk could have fallen.
