"To: Headquarters
Air Force Information Officer
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Sir,

The light appeared to be a search light of a far greater intensity than any of the many street lights in the area. The direction of the light was from the rear and above toward the northeast horizon. The light moved and maneuvered at a velocity and in a manner that would be impossible for a search light. The light moved at a rapid rate, made complete circles, figure-eights and various other intricate movements and maneuvers."
