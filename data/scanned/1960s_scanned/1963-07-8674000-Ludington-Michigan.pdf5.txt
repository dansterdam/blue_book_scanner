August 5, 1963

Dear Mr. ____,

Your letter regarding the observance of an unidentified aerial object has been forwarded to this office.

Based on information provided in your letter, the sighting appears to be consistent with observations of the V-193 airway from white cloud to dusk. The altitude, path, and duration of this sighting are not consistent with credible observations.

Your interest is appreciated.

Sincerely,

MASTON H. SACKS
