The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document with handwritten text. I will now proceed to extract the text from the document:

December 16, 1964

After due analysis of the velocity of the objects mentioned in the notes and reports, I believe that the objects were not meteors, satellites, or aircraft, since the velocity indicated was too slow for any of these. The objects were observed by competent and reliable observers and the descriptions of their appearance and motion are consistent. Based upon the available data, it appears that the objects were intelligently controlled and maneuverable, and did not conform to the normal behavior of meteors, satellites, aircraft, or any other known objects. There are no logical explanations for the observed phenomena except the possibility of the objects being extraterrestrial vehicles. Any connection between this and other incidents is unknown. I would recommend that this case be classified as UNIDENTIFIED.
