UPON NO LAUGHING MATTER !!!

TO the editor:

One other remark there was a news report about an unidentified flying object landing near Binghampton.John saw it as another "flying saucer" landing, and I think on this subject, I checked the general reaction was a somewhat frivolous on the subject.

I feel nothing wrong with people disagreeing with the subject, was brought up without thinking when the subject of "flying saucers" was broached.

The American public has been too conditioned to laughing at the subject - thinking objectively and seriously about the subject. I believe that in spite of those who ridicule and those who accept this phenomenon without any sort of life capable of traversing interstellar space to planet or even from sun to sun, there must be some sort of life capable of traversing interstellar space.

It is more than written and spoken about this subject to make the general public more aware of the subject so that they can make up their own minds objectively and with careful and rational thought.
