There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a handwritten UFO report form with text describing an observation, signed by someone named "Thanku, your".

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

UFO form continued

Dear - the vas happening - the noise was at first like a jet plane, then it increased to a roar, the plane was going east to west. I was near the Sassafras River in Maryland. I was facing north to get the best view. As it passed over I saw some thing that looked like aircraft flying but I wonder if it was the UFO.

I am waiting your further advise. 

Thanku, your
