The image contains a hand-drawn sketch showing the angle of an object above the horizon, as well as a compass-like diagram. There is no photographic image present in this document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please indicate how high the object was above the horizon (skyline). When you first saw it, please indicate where "A" is. Then, as time went by, please indicate how the object moved, and show its position at "B".

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Please use an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and make an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
