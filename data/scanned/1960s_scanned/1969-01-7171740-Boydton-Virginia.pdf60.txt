Memo for record
Subject: Report of 3 Feb 69
On 3 Feb 69, at approximately 2030 Lebanon Pike, Centerville, Ohio, Mr. W. B. observed an object that he estimated to be between 1930 and 2030 hours. The object was described as being about 30 ft in diameter, 8 ft deep and almost straight down. At 2045 hours the hole could have been caused by a meteorite. 
Mr. J...R. Y... notified me above and asked about possibility of satellite decay producing a hole 8 ft deep. Mr. E...F... in turn notified Lt. McDowell. Lt. McDowell called Mr. E...F... and they discussed this being produced by a meteorite. Dr. McClosky said it was possible but improbable. Possible only a small piece of a meteorite. Mr. Gitron said I should call him back the next day. (Mr. Gitron suggested testing with a magnetometer nine evenings or even a request on a stick.)
