34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 3 August

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire is of course welcome. What I have related to the case above is to some extent what was told to me what was related to me by the witness. I'm not sure how accurate I have reported this since this incident was several weeks ago and details may not be fully accurate. However, the witness seemed quite definite about what he saw and observed at the time.
