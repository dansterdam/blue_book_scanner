The image contains two photographs. The larger photograph on the left shows a circular object in the sky, which is described as "Mercury's Transit". The smaller photograph on the right shows what appears to be an observatory or instrument, with a caption mentioning "A. Melichar's College, St. Paul, Minnesota".

Findings from Mercury's Transit
Joseph Ashbrook

Observations of the transit of Mercury across the sun's disk were made from 128 stations in 18 countries on November 7, 1960. The observed start and completion times of the transit are given in Universal Time for each station.

The data is being analyzed by the director of the American Ephemeris, the scientific calculations of planetary motions. Resulting in the most complete data available for this century's four transits of Mercury. A surprisingly large number of experienced observers in 28 stations obtained visual and photographic observation of the transit, despite the difficulties involved.

Photographic and visual observations showed considerable variations in the duration of the transit. These variations are believed to be real, and are attributed to various atmospheric conditions at the stations, and also perhaps to instruments and observing techniques.

The transit of November 7, I960 offers valuable information about the various methods of observing this phenomenon, which periodically occur in rare intervals of more than a century.
