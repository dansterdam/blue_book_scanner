I am a retired public accountant and have done some free-lance writing and research on UFOs during my spare time. I have sighted UFOs before but this was the first time I was able to take a photograph of one. I have a keen interest in the subject of UFOs and would be glad to assist in any follow-up investigation if you so desire.
