DATE - TIME GROUP: 23 JAN 65 23 55
LOCATION: LAKEWOOD, CALIFORNIA
SOURCE: ADULT MALE, CIVILIAN
NUMBER OF OBJECTS: COULD NOT BE DETERMINED
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 7-8 MINUTES
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: VISUAL
COURSE: WEST TO EAST
PHOTOS: NONE
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE

CONCLUSION: I BELIEVE IT WAS CAUSED BY FLARES. THE OBJECT(S) APPEARED TO BE VERY BRIGHT - BRIGHTER THAN A STAR AND MOVED ACROSS THE SKY IN A STRAIGHT, STEADY COURSE FROM WEST TO EAST IN APPROXIMATELY 7-8 MINUTES. THERE WERE SEVERAL SUCH OBJECTS MOVING INDEPENDENTLY AND ALSO IN CLUSTERS. IT WAS A VERY BRIGHT, PINPOINTED LIGHT - MUCH BRIGHTER THAN A STAR. THESE APPEARED TO BE MAN-MADE DEVICES, POSSIBLY FLARES, RATHER THAN ANYTHING EXTRATERRESTRIAL.
