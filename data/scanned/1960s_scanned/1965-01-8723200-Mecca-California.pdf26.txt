Dear Mr. (redacted),

This is a reply to your letter of 24 March 1965 in which you requested information relating to Mr. (redacted)'s sighting of an unidentified flying object.

Mr. (redacted) has been advised that it will be necessary for him to supply photographs of the object for an analysis to be made. A copy of this letter is attached.

The reports on Project Blue Book, the Air Force program for investigating unidentified flying objects, indicate that since its origin in 1948, a number of sightings have been made which cannot be explained conclusively by known aeronautical or astronomical causes. However, many sightings have also been explained as known objects and phenomena. The Project Blue Book file on this particular sighting is being reviewed, and you will be informed of the results of this review as soon as it is completed.

Sincerely,

JOHN T. SPAULDING
