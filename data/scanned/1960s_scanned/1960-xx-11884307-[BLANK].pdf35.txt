Douglas Aircraft Company, Inc.
Santa Monica, California

Dear Mr. Rochlen:

This office is in receipt of the extremely able analysis performed by the Douglas Aircraft Company on the film of an unidentified flying object photographed by Mr. Nicholas Mariana at Great Falls, Montana, on August 15, 1950. The analysis of this film has proved most valuable in determining the character and location of the object in whole and in detail, and it has been forwarded by me to the Green-Rouse Studios.

Some positions of the Air Force with regard to UFOs is that the operations of individuals or private enterprises engaging UFOs are under our Air Force observation.

We agree with the conclusions stated in the second paragraph of the attached technical report, however, the final determination of the status of this film will not be resolved until the Air Force's investigation is completed. In fact, the information furnished in this report has been most helpful in determining the character of the object. The local Air Force representative, The Air Force requested Mr. Mariana's cooperation in making this information available, and he was most cooperative in doing so. We will receive a summary of the investigation through the local Air Force representative.

We are confident the report, conclusions of which will be reflected in the next release of the Air Force "Bluebook" project. This report documents sightings of UFOs over the past decade and includes the efforts of many highly competent investigators and special consultants, including known scientists and experienced pilots to the average-man-on-the-street. This report is available for consultation by the general public.
