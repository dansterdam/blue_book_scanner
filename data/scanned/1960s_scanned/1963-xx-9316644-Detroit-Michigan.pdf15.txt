NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
30 JANUARY 1963
IOA, PERU

EXCESSIVE REPORT OF SOUTH AMERICAN SAUCER "ACTIVITY" AS REPORTED IN THE PRESS

One fact points to mounting interest, not a sudden increase, in the number of reports of "flying saucers" or unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over Peru, Argentina, Chile and other parts of South America. In Peru, many people believe in the existence of flying saucers and their reports are not new either. On the night of January 29th, 1963, more than a dozen people in Ica, Peru, saw a huge glowing object in the sky. The object, some 60 feet in diameter, was observed for over 20 minutes as it passed over the city at an estimated altitude of 4,000 feet. Several of the witnesses included police officers.

On January 30th, residents of Tacna and Iquique, Chile, also reported seeing a strange aerial object. In the latter city, the "saucer" was observed for about 25 minutes moving swiftly from north to south. Similar reports came from Argentina in January, 1963, and a few from Bolivia. However, most of these strange particles were kept for analysis, and were eventually shown to be fragments of natural objects, such as meteors.
