Dear Mrs. Hunt,

Due to the time lapse involved in reporting your aerial observations to the Air Force, it is not possible for us to conduct a meaningful investigation of the sighting.

During the 18 years of investigating UFO reports, we have established a pattern of these sightings and other related phenomena which have not yielded any conclusive evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial visitations to our planet. The attached report on Project Blue Book will provide you with more information on this subject.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
