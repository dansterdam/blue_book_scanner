The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the text "Place an 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it." 

The second and third sketches show two different landscape scenes, with a person depicted in each one.
