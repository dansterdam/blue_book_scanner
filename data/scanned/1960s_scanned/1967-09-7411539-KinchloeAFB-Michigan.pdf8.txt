27 Sept. 1967
Called Capt. Kliperie at Base Operations. He told me that any aircraft moving at the speed of sound or above produces a continuous shock that is so strong that it could be heard at least 10 mile away. I asked him if an object moving at approximately 2,000 m.p.h. or less and seen a mile high would be expected to break the windows or houses over which it passed. He answered that it definitely would, in addition, it would be expected that it would cause considerable disturbance of birds, animals, and other things in its path. I asked if Flight Dynamics Lab. if it seemed inert details on sonic effects.
