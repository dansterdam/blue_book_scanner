This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a photo analysis report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 67-12
DATE OF REPORT 28 FEBRUARY 1967
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION Price, Utah
DATE 7 April 1966, 8 October and 15 October 1966
PHOTOGRAPHY (6) 35 mm color slides, (6) prints (B&W)
QUALITY Poor
1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to a request submitted by Major Quintanilla (TDETR) to determine the identity of the object photographed.
2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the referenced color slides has shown the "unidentified objects" to be a result of an attempt at night photography with insufficient illumination of anything except silhouetted sources of light. Although the type of light sources has not been determined (i.e. street lights, interior lights etc.), it was found that the image pattern and distance separating the light sources on the 8 October and 15 October 1966 frames were identical.
3. Source stated that these were isolated or individual sightings, but the photography indicates a relative coverage of the same target or background photographed from a common point. Each exposure reveals a different shape for the light sources. This is a characteristic phenomenon resulting from camera movement during the exposure when the camera is hand held. The remaining two frames of 7 April and 8 October 1966, although different patterns of light sources, exhibit camera movement along.
