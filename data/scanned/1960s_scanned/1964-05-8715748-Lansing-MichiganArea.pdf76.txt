Transcribed text:

On Friday evening, 8 May 1964, at about 2250 hrs in the Lansing, Michigan area, the witnesses observed an "airborne object" in the distance. The object was moving toward the place where the witness was, and initially looked larger as it approached. The object was described as having a "brilliant" light that "was the brightest thing I've ever seen." It was estimated to be at an approximate distance of 500 feet.

As the object neared the place where the witness was, it suddenly stopped and hovered. The object then moved swiftly and silently away, traveling straight down a path bearing approximately 030 degrees from Lansing. The witness stated that this sighting was of a "typical unidentified object" and that the object was remaining at approximately a constant distance (and hence, presumably, a constant size) or that the object was moving rapidly away and becoming smaller.

It is concluded that this sighting was of a typical unidentified object, with a slight possibility that it was a natural object (e.g., a star) that was seen descending to the horizon. The fact that the object's horizon indicates the possibility that it was a star moving along a path bearing approximately 030 degrees from Lansing.
