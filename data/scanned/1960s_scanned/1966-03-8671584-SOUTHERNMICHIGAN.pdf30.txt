I had hoped to be able to gather more data and, with the help of some of my Northwestern staff who were willing to come to the area with me and help in the interrogation and so to be able to examine many of the individual reports not associated directly with the saucer, but funds were not available for bringing in any of my associates, who are excellent interrogators in this field, and further, since the interest and excitement generated in these cases was mounting to fever pitch, it seemed expedient, in fact mandatory, to hold a press conference and make a progress report. Until the evening before I was to make such a statement, I was still puzzled as to a natural explanation for even the consistent sightings. Fortunately, I have a number of friends in the academic world in Ann Arbor and whose invaluable aid I enlisted. I would like to give credit to the scientists I talked with until very late into the night but they prefer to remain anonymous. I am sure, however, that should their testimony be officially required, rather than for the press, their cooperation could very easily be obtained.
