Dear Sir:

I certainly appreciate your answering my inquiry. The incidents you mention stand in the minds of the citizens of this area as some of the U.F.O. phenomenont that occurred at one time. The fact that my personal experience associated with yous on the phone I again told you about one.

As a private citizen I ask that you the area of information regarding WB54I7 as reported on May 24, 1960. May we have details of this report? Were any photos taken? Mt. Shasta Base is mentioned, do you have any information on the citizens who reported this? Any details whatsoever would be of great interest.

I did not receive a copy of the Blue Book as mentioned in your letter. Please send another. Thank you.

Sincerely,
