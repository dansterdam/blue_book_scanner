The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report or document discussing a sighting of some unidentified flying objects near Rockland, Massachusetts on June 26, 1963. The text describes the objects as being lighted, maneuvering, and moving in a path different from that of a commercial airliner. It also mentions that three objects were seen and tracked by witnesses over a period of time.

Here is the full text from the document:

Another "close-up" sighting was made on 26 June 1963 in Rockland, Mass. They were silitty con- trol their home when they say a lighted object with the same exact colors and light condition as reported in the Greenbush, Mass. incident. All three reported the object stopped at one point, then continued on its flight. The glow from the object emitted light orange and white, and followed an extremely irregular path, darting back and forth over its path. The flight path was choppy and irregular as in the photograph taken in Wellington, Mass on this date.
This object did appear to be close to them, but their statements to the sender said it appeared to be soiling back and forth over its path. "All three of the witnesses looked intently at the same lighted object for several minutes. The main reason we did so, was the large number of interested right angles taken by this object as it moved.." Wherever it went, it was the first time they had seen anything like it. The trio first saw it when a commercial airliner passed over their home, and all three objects were at a higher elevation than the airplane, tracing this irregular pattern.
