The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present on this page, only a sketch and some text.

The text found in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the course that the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the course to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object, and a "B" on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the sighting, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
