The image appears to show a grainy, black and white photograph or reproduction of a crowd or group of figures. The text mentions something about a "young UFO witnesses" discussing their encounter and a "Sister Mary" who was investigating the incident. However, the image does not contain any clearly identifiable human faces, so I will not attempt to describe or name any individuals shown.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

"They want to argue with these young UFO witnesses. The youth said, exactly what they saw. The men would not pay any more attention to them. Yesterday afternoon they were playing on the playground where they noticed the strange objects in the sky. They saw them and they know they saw them."
