The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

A MILITARY OFFICER INVESTIGATED THE REPORTING
OFFICER'S FINDINGS AND CONCLUDED THAT THE REPORT WAS
APPARENTLY NOT CONTRARY TO AIR FORCE REGULATIONS 
THAT REQUIRE THE REPORTING OF UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA. 
THE OFFICER STATED THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THE REPORT WAS
GENUINE AND THAT THE OBJECT SEEN COULD HAVE BEEN AN
UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON. HE RECOMMENDED THAT 
THE REPORT BE RETAINED BY THE PROJECT AND CONSIDERED
AS PART OF THE OVERALL DATA COLLECTION EFFORT.
IT IS REPORTED THAT THE SPACE CENTER, THE GOODYEAR
BLIMP, AND SEVERAL AIRCRAFT WERE OPERATING IN THE IMMEDIATE
AREA AT THAT TIME. THIS AREA IS NEAR GAINSVILLE, FLORIDA.
THERE WERE NO COMMENTS FROM THE AGENCIES OR 
WITNESSES KNOWN TO BE POSSIBLE.
