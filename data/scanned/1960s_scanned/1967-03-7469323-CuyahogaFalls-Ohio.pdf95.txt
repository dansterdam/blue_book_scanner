18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. About how much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The object appeared to be relatively small and was covered by the match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include as much of the details that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show the direction the object was moving. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
