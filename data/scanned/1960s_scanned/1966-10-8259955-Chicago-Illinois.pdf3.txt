There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page of an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Text from the document:

17. It would have been about the size of a match-head at arms length. The object left a vapor trail passing northwest. The speed of the object I'd say it was traveling about 180 m.p.h.

20. Again estimating I'd say it was about 5 miles high.

21. What i observed when I saw it was near an air field, but I'm sure it wasn't a aircraft because looking through binoculars I could see it was cigar shaped, transparent and had what appeared to be a cabin on the underside.

23. I feel it was unusual in that it was with my own eyes.

24. I would like to know what it was.

25. Plane lights would be the closest resemblance to the lights I saw, but these were much brighter and all the way around.

27. This is a picture that shows the motion had left a brief trail behind.

28. I have never seen anything like this before. The object appeared to be solid, flew silently, and to my surprise, it stood still at one point. I was amazed at its size and shape. I decided to watch it closely because I didn't know what it was.

30. It reminded me of an orange blob in the sky dropping down my back...

31. I don't know why I was talking about it. This is the first time I have reported such an incident. I have read about such things in the past, but now that I have witnessed it, I really don't know what to make of it.
