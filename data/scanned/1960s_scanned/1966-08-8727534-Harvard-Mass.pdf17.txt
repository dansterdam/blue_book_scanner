Kell was about thirty feet away behind a small hill, his wife was about fifty feet away also behind a hill. They observed a strange object about sixty feet in diameter hovering about four hundred feet above the ground. The object was round in shape and appeared to be a metallic silver color. It remained stationary for about two minutes and then suddenly shot upward at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. 

The couple was quite shaken by the experience. They immediately reported the sighting to the local authorities and to Project Blue Book. The report was investigated and found to be credible, with no logical explanation for the strange object observed that night.
