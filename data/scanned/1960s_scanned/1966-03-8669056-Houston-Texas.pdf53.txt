Official Report By
Cadet Patrick O. Myers
Civil Air Patrol Squadron 686
Fremont Ohio

Dear Sir:

A large U.F.O. has been sighted near Clyde Ohio. Many people have reported seeing it. Civilians send about 20 calls to our squadron 686 contact number. They can't tell them to convince us for us.

The object which I also saw was about 30 times the size of th moon. A bright flash was spotted like a star in a mile from far away. It moved from west to east, and then start to west. The radio reported that the object was seen in much that direction in which it moved.

The U.A.F. does not get such envelopes. Here is a clipping report by our local news paper:

Space Objects
Seen At Clyde

CLYDE -- Were visitors from other planets visiting Clyde for a few minutes Monday night? Some residents of that village say they saw a strange flying object in the sky about 8:45 p.m. Monday.
The object was spotted on two sides of the village shortly before 9 p.m. An unidentified resident of North Main Street called the Clyde woman Village police to report two calls.

The first one was a bright, elongated object with a reddish glow emiting from the front, the caller said. The object hovered for a few seconds before it shot away at a high rate of speed.

The second call came from James Allen, who reported his wife had spotted a similar object in the sky about 8:45 p.m. over their home. They had also seen the object south of their home, Allen said.

Mrs. Mason compared the size of the strange object to the size of the moon. She spotted the object when she let her dog out. When she looked back, the object was gone.

Both Mrs. Mason attempted to get a better look at the object but it was traveling too fast. Both women repeatedly stated the did not just disappear.

Thank you;
Sincerely,
