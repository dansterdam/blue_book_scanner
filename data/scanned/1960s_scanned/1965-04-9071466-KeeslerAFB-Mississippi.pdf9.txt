KEESFTER AP., MISSISSIPPI  
6 APRIL 1965

The time of the sighting was approximately 12:00 a.m. The observer sighted a black oval object estimated to be 40 ft. long and appeared to be the shape of a football with four lights spaced from one end to the other on the underside. The lights were all white and of high intensity and looked the same when they disappeared as when they appeared. The intensity was compared to that of a searchlight but this was not a satellite because it was too low and four lights rather than one. At first the observer thought it was the four lights, but when the object got closer it looked like a dark oval, darker than the cloud background. Under this was a single layer as though it were a semicircle. The observer first saw the lights at approximately 45 degrees elevation and 200 - 300 degrees azimuth. In the southwest the object passed overhead and passed southeast at 40 to 45 degrees elevation.

The observer at first thought the object was an aircraft and he called SAC and they had no flying at night, unless it would be a Coast Guard aircraft, everything on the flight line is from 10 pm and 5 am. 

The wind at the time was from 130 degrees and the object moving largely across the wind.

The possibility is a reflection of searchlights off the clouds. The light of a searchlight which is 1 mile away, often reflects over the clouds. However, an observer noticed that the object was solid structure. Also, there was a noise.
