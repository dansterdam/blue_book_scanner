DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
HEADQUARTERS 29TH AIR DIVISION (ADC)
DULUTH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
DULUTH, MINNESOTA 55814

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report (507th Wing msg, 12 Sep 1967)

TO: FTD (TDDT-UF0)

1. In addition to the RAPCON (Radar Approach Control) sighting of SSgt Burris, two small boys from Kincheloe, on Sunday afternoon, 10 September, 1967. Their telephoned report was routed through Sault Ste. Marie AFS (a radar site about 20 miles from Kincheloe) to Lt. Lehman, the Information Officer in Kincheloe, who recorded the relevant information. This report was not forwarded to FTD because of a lack of evidence to substantiate it.

2. No interception of the objects was attempted because authority for a scramble must come from the Senior Director at 29th Air Division until the following day. Also the objects were not detected by any SAGE directed radar, only by the RAPCON unit, which has a range normally limited to about 40NM, or, at the most, 60NM. It is unlikely that any experienced Senior Director would order a scramble under these conditions.

3. There was no visual sighting of the objects, although Kincheloe control tower personnel were on duty at the time, and two of the objects passed over the base. If they were actual physical objects, they were probably at a very low altitude, since they were not detected by SAGE-directed radar.

4. In addition to SSgt Burris, the UFO's were also observed by A2C Rodney Roe and A2C Robert Carlson, both assigned to the RAPCON unit. The unit telephone extension is 3194.
