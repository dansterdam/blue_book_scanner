ENGLISH-SPEAKING LITTLE MEN LAND IN NEW YORK STATE: A farmer in Newark Valley, near Binghamton, New York, claims that he spoke to little men who landed in a craft near his farmhouse. The farmer, named Gary Wilcox, told his story to a local newspaper several days later. He claimed that he had no fear of the humanoid creatures "because they weren't hostile" and seemed to have no weapons or any desire to harm him.
Wilcox said he was standing in his cornfield on his 300 acre farm when he saw a glitter like the reflection from a mirror. At first he thought it was merely the sun reflecting, but then he saw a smooth, egg-shaped luminous object about 20 feet long and 15 feet wide. Wilcox walked up and looked inside the craft. He said it was made of some sort of seamless material, and they were wearing suits made of some sort of material, according to Wilcox, but he could not tell what part of their bodies their voices came from. They told him not to tell what he had seen, and that they would not return to Earth; and that for his own good, he should not try to investigate them further. 
This incident tends to confirm the veracity of Gary Wilcox, a farmer living in nearby Newark Valley, New York, who reported back in April that he conversed with two little men who identified themselves as Martians. This incident is described in detail in our September issue.
