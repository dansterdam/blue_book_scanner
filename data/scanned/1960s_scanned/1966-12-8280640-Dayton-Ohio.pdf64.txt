The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, specifically a letter dated February 14, 1967 from George C. Freeman, Jr. of the Community Relations Division of the Office of Information.

Text of the Letter:

Dear Sir:

Reference your request for information on three unidentified flying object (UFO) observations. Without additional information on the exact time and location of the observations, it is not possible to identify the specific objects.

The optical aids that were utilized, etc., are essential in a comprehensive evaluation. In addition to the optical aids utilized, any additional information as to size, speed, altitude, direction of travel, and time of day, etc., would be extremely helpful in evaluating the objects.

Normally, records of any air activity in a particular area are destroyed after 20 days. However, I shall check our files to determine if any data is available on the incidents in question.

Your interest in our program is appreciated. I am sorry that I could not be of more help to you.

Sincerely,

GEORGE C. FREEMAN, JR.
