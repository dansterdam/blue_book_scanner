27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the course line to show how high the object was above the horizon (in degrees) when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the course line to show how high above the horizon (in degrees) the object was when you last saw it. Draw an arrow to show the path the object took as it passed. (Draw this path so it will appear to pass when you first saw the object.)
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
30. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
