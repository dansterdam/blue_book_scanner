34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 13 Day Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object was hovering very low, just treetop level, over a farm field. it seemed to be doing nothing other than hovering low with no visible means of propulsion. The craft was disk shaped and completely silent. We watched it for over 10 minutes before it suddenly acceleratied straight up and out of sight at tremendous speed. None of the other usual aircraft noises or signs were present. Only a few lights were visible on the craft, and those remained steady throughout the sighting. It was a very unsettling experience as the craft seemed to defy normal physical laws. I still cannot adequately explain what I saw that night.
