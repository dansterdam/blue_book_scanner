Gentlemen:

SUBJ: UFO Sighting Around July 4, 1960, Revere Beach, Mass.

After six years, you are probably wondering why I finally decided to report my sighting. Curiosity, time, and courage to write are my answers. I am now a somewhat member of the child, and I was in the library the came day and decided to obtain a book on UFOs.

A certain file was showing air force and UFO's. I came across a 1.5" folder (not name of author's correct name). In that book, I noticed that most letters from civilians are answered, even if a few time border the ridiculous.

Could you please tell me whether anyone reported this sighting and whether it has been explained or not. Approximately 3,000 people might have been watching the same Fourth of July fireworks and seen the same thing. Here is my story.

The Fourth of July Fireworks were held within a few days XXXXX of the 4th, 1960. My then boyfriend XXXXX of Sellem, Mass. (who has not been for five years) and myself were parked along the beach waiting for the fireworks to begin at about 10:00 p.m. About 9:45 p.m.
