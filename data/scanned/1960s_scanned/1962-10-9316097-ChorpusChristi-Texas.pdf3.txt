Glass Sample Received from the Air Force

Examination of the subject sample indicated that the largest fragments contained both a green and a molded surface which was cracked. Since these two surfaces were opposite each other, the wedge-shaped pieces between them were apparently compressed to this thickness. These linear impressions or cracks, as represented by the broken surfaces, were approximately 2-3/8 inches long.

Generally speaking, the molded surface of these fragments was similar to the surface of large carboys, acid bottles or the 5 gallon wide-mouthed jars currently sold for 5 gallons in junk. In addition to the raised cradle lines, there were some surface irregularities and small pits.

Examination indicated that these lines or grooves were shear marks.

Considering the foregoing characteristics, it appears that the glass fragments may have originated from one of the larger carboys or wide-mouth jars, since the ridges or evidence of the mold would indicate that the ware was machine molded. Also, since no necessary machinery to do these large jobs is present, it is quite possible that the glass sample represents a direct blow of some kind rather than a crush formation.

Impurities in amorphous character indicated that the glass presents a rather intricate design, not at all similar to commonly available glass. Moreover, a chemical analysis is not necessary. Therefore, the sample is being returned without this correspondence.
