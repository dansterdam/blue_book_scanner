11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observed an object which appeared to be a circular, rotating luminous object, about 500 ft in diameter, with a red taillight. The object moved in an erratic, zigzagging pattern at high speed. The observer stated this was the fourth time he had observed such an object in the same general area. The possibility that this was an experimental aircraft cannot be ruled out.
