The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, containing a questionnaire with various questions related to the sighting of a UFO or unidentified object.

Project Blue Book Data
14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle one:) No. Don't know.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle one:) Yes. No. Don't know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a matchstick or one's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust or vapor trails. (Please an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.)
