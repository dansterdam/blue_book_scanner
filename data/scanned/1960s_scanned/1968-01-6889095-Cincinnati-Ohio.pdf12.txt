UFO Observation, 1 January 1968

1. Reference your unidentified observation of 1 January 1968. We feel that you might have been watching two small, helium filled hot air balloons, especially in the neighborhood of colleges and universities. Incidents like this type of observation.

2. Once again, thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
