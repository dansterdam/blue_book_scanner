The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a report on the investigation of UFO sightings in Dexter, Michigan and Hillsdale, Michigan on March 20 and March 21, 1966.

The text in the document is as follows:

REPORT ON THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DEXTER, MICHIGAN SIGHTING OF 20 MARCH AND THE HILLSDALE, MICHIGAN SIGHTING OF 21 MARCH 1966

Primary
The two sightings at Dexter and Hillsdale, respectively, may be called the crucial sightings which became the focal point of local attention (and later of nationwide) and which associated with them a veritable barrage of other reports with so clean-cut association with the two principal events under discussion here. It is possible that many of these were the result of the general excitement surrounding these events and of suggestibility on the part of those who reported them. However, there were reports of odd sightings, particularly in the Milan area, a few nights previous to the sightings discussed. It would have taken an army of investigators to have questioned in detail all of these. 

In the course of my three days of investigation, I talked with the following people at some length and with a host of others in passing:

County Sheriff Harvey - Washtenaw County
Deputy Stanley McFadden
Deputy David Fitzpatrick
Patrolman Kendall 
Patrolman Harold G. Miller
Chief Taylor
Mr. ****** - law abiding citizens
Univ of Mich Astronomy Dept. (11 members)
Univ of Mich Physics Dept, Henry Reed, Radio and television engineer
Sgt. John Palmer - Goshen Police
Miss ******* - two students - Hillsdale College.
Patrolman Clyde Myers - two students - Hillsdale College
Sgt. Schuerder, Deputies Bushre and Anderson were contacted by A2C Hanby.*
