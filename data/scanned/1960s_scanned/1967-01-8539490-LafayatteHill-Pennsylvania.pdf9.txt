Dear Sirs:

About two months ago, I sent you some color slides of a UFO, and I have not received any acknowledgment or comments. Of course, these are thousands of sighting reports ahead of mine, and I realize that all I am sending you is a description of these slides, and the fact that I have them.

It seems out of the north-west, it was a "bright blue-white light", and when it came to a standstill, it was with a steady shine not pulsating. just a steady shine about one-quarter the size of the Moon. Though it was some sort of satellite, that rose in the north-west and passed in the east-south-east through the sky, it was not blinking as conventional satellites and I cannot state its exact size and can only say that it seemed to be about one-quarter the size of the Moon.

When I came back out however, the blue-white light had disappeared, but I did notice a reddish-brown light moving in the same direction as the blue-white light, just as this light was diminishing, rapidly I should say, I verified this by locking on to it through a pair of 7x50 binoculars, the UFO stopped just opposite of me, small in size, it did not move farther than that position or in any other direction. Then it stayed motionless for several minutes, then gradually swung around to a southerly course, which it maintained till it disappeared.

The slides of the UFO are on Agfachrome D-200, exposure was 1/4 of a second at aperture F/2.8, the slides are numbered 12, 13, 15, 16 & 17 respectively. There is also a separate Agfachrome slide that was taken through a three-inch astronomical telescope at about thirty power. It is a picture of the Moon in its crescent phase, but in one corner marked with a black arrow, there is an unidentified bright object.
