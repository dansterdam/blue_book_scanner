29 January 1963
Arica, Chile

About January 29th, a saucer was photographed by an Arica man named Gino Rossa. This photo is reproduced at the top of this next page.

The UFO appeared visually small, but the photograph shows it as much larger than it actually was, due to the long exposure time used in taking the picture. The object appeared to be brighter than the surrounding landscape, likely due to the long exposure.
