The image contains two sketches. The larger one is a compass rose, with the cardinal directions and intermediate directions labeled. The smaller sketches depict a person standing on a road or path, with the landscape visible in the background.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

SA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE LOOKING UPON THE COMPASS ROSE PLACED AT "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN, CONNECTED BY A LINE TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION AND DISTANCE TRAVELED. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
