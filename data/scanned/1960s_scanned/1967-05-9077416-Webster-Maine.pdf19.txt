1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified sighting report furnished by you under date of May 13, 1957.

2. The observer describes the object as a yellow, white, flat, oval shape that had two "intense beams of light" emanating from it, and in his opinion, hovered along the horizon line of light.

3. Were you operating in the Atlantic City area on or near the date cited? If you were not in the area at the time, do you have any information that could assist in the case?
