ATTN OF: G435(C-5)

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 17 August 1967 (Your nr: 20 Sep 67)

TO: Air Force Technology Division
AFSC - Evaluation Air, Code 455333

1. Reference your letter 20 Sep 67, Subject: "Unidentified Aerial Object observed on 17 August 1967 at 2125 EDST".

2. On 17 August 1967 at approximately 2125 EDST, two of the security guard personnel on duty observed a relatively bright light in the sky traveling in a northerly direction. The light appeared to be at an altitude of 1,500 feet or more and was moving at a rapid rate of speed. It was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing from view.

3. It is very difficult to determine what type object caused this phenomenon since the only information given is the security guard's observation. No photographs or other physical evidence has been obtained to substantiate their report.

4. If you can be of any further assistance, please let us know, or duty phone is 609 724-3100, Extension 2771/2743.
