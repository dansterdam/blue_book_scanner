SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968

1. Reference your letter of 24 June 1969, regarding the scientific study of UFOs. The Project Blue Book will not be published until March or April 1970; the policy for release of information in the astronomy report of the observations will be decided later.

2. We are very interested in your solution to the projected large-scale UFO photographic study. However, the Project Blue Book will not be published until March or April 1970. You should not publicize your calculations or mention the astronomy report of the observations until your permission is granted for the release of this material.

3. If you would send us a draft of your calculations we may be able to provide you with police and other agencies in the same air. Determine if anyone finds any evidence to support or deny this sighting.
