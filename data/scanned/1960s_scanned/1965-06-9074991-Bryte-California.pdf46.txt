Vincentown, N.J., June 24, 1965

On June 24, Mrs. ___, of Vincentown, New Jersey reported a large platter-shaped object buzzing her car on Red Lion Road. The object glowed and had a sort of "cockpit" in the center. It also had windows, something like airplane windows and a red light on it. Mrs. ___, 30, of Hamilton Lake, New Jersey shortly thereafter discovered a circular imprint on white sand in a clearing of a wooded location. The circumference of the circle is marked by a blackened, solid rim of fused sand and is depressed about five inches. The circle is "perfectly round" and has a deposit of odd, "crusty" material in the middle. There is also a minor circular area about four feet inside the outer circle. This sighting, which occurred on the 18th Anniversary of the 'modern era' and orbit-al sighting by pilot Ken Arnold of a Cascade Mountain flying object, was reported by the State of New Jersey sightings to the State Police at the Red Lion Barracks on June 24, 1947. The South Jersey sightings are being investigated by the State Police at the Red Lion Barracks.
