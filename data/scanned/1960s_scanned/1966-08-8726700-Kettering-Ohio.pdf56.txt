Dear [redacted],

Reference your unusual photographs which were forwarded to our office for analysis.

Photographic analysis revealed the following: Slide #1 - a normal one or two good transparencies highly magnified. There may also be some bad transparencies. This unusual quality of the transparencies may be due to the fact that they appear to contain shadows that do not appear on a normal good transparency.

The higher the magnification, the more focus on lack of focus can be observed. The image on slide #7 could be the image of an object. Any identification from the submitted photographs would be only speculation.

Your interest in Project Blue Book is appreciated. Please return your slides. Thank you for submitting them for our evaluation.

Sincerely,

EDWARD G. FREEMAN, JR.
