Dear Mrs. Rains:

This is in reply to your letter in which you described your observation of an object on the morning of 22 June 1965.

Based on the data which you submitted, the Air Force tends to agree with your contention that you may have seen a sun rising in the northeast even though you did not mention the position of the sun with relation to the position of the object which you observed. Sunrise occurred at Trenton, Missouri, on that date at 5:19 am on a heading of 060 degrees.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING
