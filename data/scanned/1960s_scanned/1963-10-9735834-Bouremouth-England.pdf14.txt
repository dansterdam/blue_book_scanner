The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with a series of questions and space for the witness to provide responses.

14c. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle one: Yes, No, Don't know. If you answered YES, describe behind what)
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle one: Yes, No, Don't know. If you answered YES, describe in front of what)
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the shape, size, color, and especially show the direction the object was moving. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
