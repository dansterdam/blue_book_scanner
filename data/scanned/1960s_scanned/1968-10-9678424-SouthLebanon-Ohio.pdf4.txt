The text in the document reads:

"Dear Sir:
I have investigated the incident which occurred on the 9th of Oct. and submit the following:
The object was sighted by two adults and three children. They were in the field west of the 'Pike' when they observed the object. It seemed to be hovering or moving slowly over the field. The object was described as being 20-30 feet in diameter and a dull gray color. It made no sound. The object was observed for about 10 minutes before disappearing rapidly 'like a shot' to the west. The witnesses state that there were two other similar objects in the sky at the same time but they disappeared before this object did. The witnesses are certain that the object was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. I do not feel that I can make any definite conclusion as to the identity or origin of the object. The witnesses appear to be reliable and sincere in their statements."
