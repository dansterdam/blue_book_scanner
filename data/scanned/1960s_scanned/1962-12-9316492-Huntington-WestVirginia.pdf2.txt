Unidentified Flying Object Observer's Report
December 25, 1962

Gentlemen:

This sighting was made Tuesday morning, between 4:30 and 4:40, December 18, 1962. The sky was clear and the moon was shining bright. The object was about 46.50 above the horizon due East of Huntington, W.Va.

The star-or planet-I will refer to it as a star, was bright and steady. It commenced rapidly descending and followed a zig-zag course during the early morning hours about mid-way around the horizon between the Big Dipper and the rising point of the morning star. The star would disappear for a few seconds at a time, and then reappear a little closer to the horizon between 4 a.m. and 4:15 a.m., approaches its zenith about dawn and fades out well before the morning star. Fading the Morning Star as well as it had been visible shortly after raising about No. 3 or No. 4. 

The U.F.O. was visible to me as a point of light, faintly about No. 1 or No. 2 in size, brilliance diminishing as it moved away from the star to the east low point.

I first noticed the U.F.O. while looking at the star and wandered about a star of that size is that fast and then I watched closely again and see it move at a faster speed and that size that close and paid particular attention to that size that close and paid particular attention.
