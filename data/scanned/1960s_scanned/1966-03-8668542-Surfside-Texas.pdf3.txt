The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing a UFO sighting witnessed by the Quartermaster of a watch and Glenn A. Mushett, RMI 326-518, U.S.C.G.

According to the text in the document, the Quartermaster reported seeing a blue flash in the sky around 1:35 AM local time. Moments later, the ship and entire area had a power failure. Mushett then reported seeing a UFO in the sky and called out to someone else to come see it. Mushett went outside and observed a very large object in the sky that was giving off an orange glow and around 1,000 feet in size. The object then started moving up slowly, reaching an altitude of around 1,000 feet, at which point the orange glow subsided and the UFO moved away at high speed, disappearing from sight within seconds. The document states that the Quartermaster and Mushett watched the area and saw two objects shoot up from the ground at a high rate of speed, giving off a white glow but no trail or stream as they moved up, before quickly going out of sight.
