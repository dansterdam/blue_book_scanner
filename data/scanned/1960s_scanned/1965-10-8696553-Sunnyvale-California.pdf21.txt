This thing because the great discrepancies between the stories. 2 military officers claimed to have seen a strong maneuverable object go across the sky and took notes as soon as we got home to talk about it, we was unable to say Just what we saw. 

As we did see something, and it's amazing. 

There were about 12 other people who saw the same thing. I was called the manager's report; the phone operator took the call and sent it up through normal channels. Of course as we were all interested, we asked the men if they considered calling the authorities and they said no, they didn't want to because if they did, they were certain the authorities would come and want to do things to them or the campus and they didn't want that.

A larger thing disappeared behind the trees, the hill behind couldn't be seen and to the college men who saw it would say that they saw a large dark shape with a glowing rim, come up rapidly over the horizon and seem to pause, then it angled towards the east in a very smooth fashion and was gone. We saw it follow the same path on the return trip it made a much softer maneuver, maintaining the same speed and glided back across the horizon. 

For the things in hopes (?) that will come again. We're all so startled that we'd prefer it didn't happen again. But in the interest of science....

Sunday days and I saw a peculiar things. The student was sitting on the bench in the arboretum when I happened by, and nothing unusual to report other than I told him I thought I saw something in the sky, then just stood still there for as long as we were standing there. 

Other than being very shocked, we're all just a little bit puzzled. Could you please find out someone who knows more about these things - well, carry our investigation.

Much love, Jane!
