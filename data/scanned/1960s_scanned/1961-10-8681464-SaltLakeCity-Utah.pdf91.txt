PROJECT GRUDGE
16 NOVEMBER 1961 

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. At approximately 1900 hours on 8 October 1951, the Ogden Air Force Base radar station picked up an unidentified target on their radar screens. The target was tracked for several minutes as it moved in an erratic manner over the Salt Lake City area.  

2. The unidentified target was described as appearing very bright and distinct on the radar screen and seemed to be moving at a high rate of speed. At times, the target appeared to accelerate and decelerate rapidly.

3. The radar station notified the Salt Lake City air defense filter center of the unidentified target. Two F-86 jet interceptors were scrambled to investigate, but they were unable to visually acquire the target.

4. After several minutes, the unidentified target faded from the radar screen and was lost. The incident was reported to the Air Force's Project Blue Book for further investigation.
