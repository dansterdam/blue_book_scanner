On sighting the object in the clearwater run. I was out with my wife on the night of this sight - ing. we drive along the causeway between Clearwater and Bay pines, fla. I noticed some object on the horizon. It seemed to be moving but I wasn't sure so I pulled off the road and stopped the car to observe it more closely. I first thought it was an airplane but it was much bigger and seemed to be hovering. It had various colored lights around the perimeter and a white light in the center. It seemed to change colors from red to green to blue. I watched it for about 10 or 15 minutes. I called my wife's attention to it and she also observed it. I had already reported this to the authorities. When we first noticed it, it was off to the north-east in the direction of Tampa. As we watched, it seemed to be moving slowly in our direction. After about 10 or 15 minutes, the lights suddenly went out and it just disappeared. I have never seen anything like it before. I am quite sure it was not an airplane or any other known aircraft. This all took place between 9:00 and 10:00 pm. I do not know what it could have been unless it was some kind of experimental aircraft. Maybe fifteen minutes at the most. I wrote this as soon as I got home.
