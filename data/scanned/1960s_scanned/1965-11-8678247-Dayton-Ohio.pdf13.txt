The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions. The diagram appears to be a sky map or compass showing different angle measurements, likely intended to help observers track the movement of objects in the sky. The instructions below the diagram ask the reader to imagine a scenario and draw a picture depicting the motion of the observed object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
