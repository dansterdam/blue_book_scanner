The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 16 October 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I wish to know but do not know what the objects were. They seemed to travel at artificial satellite velocities which I have observed before. 

Amongst the other observers say they saw material a little differently but I must assure you the observation was very strange.
