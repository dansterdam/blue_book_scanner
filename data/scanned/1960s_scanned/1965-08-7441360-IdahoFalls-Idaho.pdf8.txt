August 3, 1959
USAF, Pocatello

Dear Sirs:

I had no prior knowledge there were any reports of UFO's when I submitted piece of paper. There were no other phenomena observed at the time. I had asked the Tower Operator if he had seen what I had seen and his response was negative but he offered that there had been numerous report of phenomena. This was the first I had any knowledge of any previously reported sightings. They did not appear to be on a collision course with the earth. There was no explosion when they passed beneath the horizon. The time was August 1, 1959.

Respectfully yours,
(C.H.de J. Pinon?)
MAJOR, USAF RETIRED.
