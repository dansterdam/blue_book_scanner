On the night of April 1st, Mrs. Elizabeth Charnney of Boston, Mass., was returning home with her 11-year-old son when she made a remarkable sighting of a cigar-shaped object not more than 150 yards in the air. It had four windows and a red light. In the rear, which was alternately bright and dim, she watched as it made some maneuvers for about 15 minutes, whereupon it was joined by these smaller objects. Shortly thereafter, all four objects disappeared at the same time. As soon as the UFOs were out of sight, Mrs. Charnney saw seven Air Force planes in the area. Said Mrs. Charnney "I think they were from Hanscom Field in Bedford. They seemed to be searching for something!".
