Sir, I wanted to relate this little date a visit I had the night of Nov. 8, 1967. I went outside about 9:00 PM and was watching the sky. I soon saw a strange bright object coming from the northwest and it came closer. When it was right over me, it hovered for about 5 minutes and then went straight up and disappeared very fast. It seemed to be 20 to 30 feet in diameter and was giving off a bright white light. I called my husband and my daughter, and they also saw the object. We were all amazed and wondered what it could be. Most light planes have an orange color and make noise, but this object was silent and seemed to be a different color. We waited to see if it would return, but it did not. I am quite sure we saw some kind of flying object that is not explained. I would be most interested to know if anyone else reported seeing the same thing that night. Please let me know if you have any information on this. Thanking you in advance, I am, Sincerely yours, Heater Francantine May
