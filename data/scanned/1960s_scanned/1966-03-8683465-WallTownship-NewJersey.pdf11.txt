WALL TOWNSHIP, N.J. -- The Army has the pictures and just won't talk about them.
What the Army calls "classified" and the Wall Township lad calls a "flying saucer" was the center of much speculation around Monmouth County and just talk on May 11.
Well, a 13-year-old boy took some pictures on March 30, authorities say, of what he believes was a flying saucer over the Monmouth County Civil Defense headquarters here.
The youth showed the photos to the Army, which has not commented on them.
THE YOUTH said he was walking his dog along the Mueller gravel pit here when he suddenly saw the strange object in the sky. He snapped several pictures and brought a print to a neighbor.
The neighbor, Frank L. Wilgus, said the boy was "excited and nervous" and reported seeing the strange craft hovering in the sky and then zooming off.
Wilgus turned the photographs over to Army authorities, who held them until yesterday. He said an examination revealed the negatives were probably authentic.
THE ARMY has not released the pictures or commented on them. Wilgus said he was told the pictures are being studied and no further information would be given out.
The youth, who was not identified, made no public announcement of his sighting. He and his family have refused to discuss the incident. The Army also refused to comment.
