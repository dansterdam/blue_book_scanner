34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 13 JUNE 1966 

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

This was when I was riding my bike to scout and watched it and saw that it was a large light on top - while we were riding down the highway (route 48) I could see it changing color and blink on and off while it was hovering there. When we got to the scout meeting it was still there - some of the boys called the air base camp and reported it out but we weren't able to determine what it was - some said it too but whether they were kidding started the meeting on time.
