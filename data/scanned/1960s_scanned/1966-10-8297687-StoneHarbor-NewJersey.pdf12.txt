Gentlemen:

I am very sorry that I haven't sent you this form sooner, but I couldn't find it after I filled it out. Would you please send me the results. I would like to know what opinion on what you think it is. I surely don't know.

Do you have any information on UFOs that I might have? Also would you be so kind as to send me some information on becoming a member of your great organization, Project Blue Book. I have read many magazines, pamphlets, and books on UFOs. I have my own classification on these things. Some are hoaxes, some is mistaken identity, and some as yet unexplained. I have studied them for 10 years and I thought I would not be one myself.
