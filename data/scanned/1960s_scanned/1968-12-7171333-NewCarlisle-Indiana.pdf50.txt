Last night about 6:45 local time I was out in the yard and noticed a very bright object in the sky towards the north moving southwest. At first I thought it was a plane but as I watched it the object got dimmer and then brighter. It seemed to pulsate at times. I ran into the house to get my telescope and when I got back the object had moved a short distance but was still in the same general area. I watched it for about 30 minutes and it continued to pulse with a bright light. The pulsation was about 1 second in duration. It did not seem to be moving very fast, the speed was slow and deliberate. I lost sight of it when it got behind some trees. The night was clear and cold and the object appeared to be about 15-20 degrees above the horizon. It made no sound.
21. PHYSICAL NATURE ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF, INSTRUMENTATION, OR OTHER PHENOMENA OBSERVED?
None that I know of. The object did not seem to disturb me or the telescope in any way. I just sat and watched it pulse and move in the sky.
A. DID THE PHENOMENON DISTURB THE GROUND OR LEAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE?
NO
