HIGH RADIATION FOLLOWS UFO SIGHTING: On the night of November 26th, Mrs. Florence Rosenburgh of Grand Valley, Pennsylvania, saw a bright ball of light hovering very fast about 100 feet above a nearby bam. It was only about 100 feet above the ground, according to Mrs. Rosenburgh. The next morning, an area around the bam was found to have high radiation levels. A local saucer investigator came the following day with a Geiger counter and detected a radioactive count five times normal in the area. In front of the barn, the investigator found the imprint of a dark oblong shape in the snow. Mrs. Rosenburgh added that her small dog was slightly radioactive after the incident.
