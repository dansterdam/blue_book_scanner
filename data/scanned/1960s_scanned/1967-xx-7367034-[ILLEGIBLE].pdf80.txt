The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text in the document is as follows:

"I was driving just about to pick my son up at school, when at about 5:30 pm I saw a strange bright light moving very slowly in the sky. It seemed to be only a few hundred yards away, almost directly overhead. I got up on the roof and look quickly, and it was definitely not an aircraft. 

It was triangular in shape, with three bright lights on the bottom, and it seemed to be motionless. After observing it for about 30 seconds, it began moving slowly southward and then disappeared. This all occurred in about 2 minutes."
