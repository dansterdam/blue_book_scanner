WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA
23 JANUARY 1965

AT 0639, 23 January 1965, observer first noticed object appear from behind trees and move in a southwesterly direction. The object was first sighted at about 30 degrees above the horizon and was observed for approximately 7 to 10 minutes. It was a very fast moving object with no visible means of propulsion. The observer said it traveled at least 45 degrees in 3 to 4 seconds and was at times extremely bright, as though reflecting sunlight. The object finally disappeared to the southwest.

COMMENTS

The observer was a very reliable person who was interviewed by the writer. His description of the object was extremely clear and accurate. He stated that as object was hovering there was a "hazy look" to it. As object was moving, it had a "missile-like appearance." Size of object was estimated to be approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length.

Due to the high reliability of the observer and the excellent description of the object, it is considered that the object was a solid object and not an astronomical body or aircraft. However, no positive identification could be made. The cause of the reported object remains unknown.

Since no conclusive evidence can establish the identity of the observed object, the case is left unidentified and no positive conclusion can be drawn at this time.
