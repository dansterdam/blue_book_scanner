THE OFFICER said they sighted the object and that the object seemed to be hovering. He stated the object was about 200 feet wide and 30 feet thick. It had a greenish-blue color and a row of red and blue lights around the perimeter. There were four white lights in the middle. The object seemed to be oscillating and moving about 300 yards away from them at about 1,000 feet altitude.

The object then accelerated and moved away from them at a high rate of speed. They watched the object for about 10 minutes before it disappeared.

Deputy Baker said the object was triangular in shape and had a strange glow around it. It did not have any protrusions or wings and seemed to be a solid object.

The officers were not sure what they had seen. They did not have any idea of what the object could be. It did not seem to be an aircraft or any other known object. The officers were not able to determine what the object was.
