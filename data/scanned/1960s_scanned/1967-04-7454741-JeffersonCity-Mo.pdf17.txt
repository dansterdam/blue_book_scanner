Lt. Colonel Hector Quintanilla -3- August 5, 1969

Scientists. And I am particularly surprised at his statement that he thinks the "used as a 'signal'" which is even more to the point, hynek's a statement that Condon and the entire National Academy of Sciences could not have been so used.

Another thing that strikes me as peculiar is his continued reference to "world War I holms," which is unusual for someone only 25. He claims to have 20-20 vision, but is this man who served with my reconnaissance unit, I would very much doubt it.

As for my evaluation, I would say that the object seen could very well have been a German bomb. However, until the questions I have raised about viewing through windows or windshields and sights and sounds from my machine can be resolved, I am not persuaded the object was other than a conventional aircraft, and possibly some other lights. However, if the interview is reopened, I would strongly suggest that someone other than myself ask the questions. He should be asked to reconstruct precisely where he was looking and what he was describing, and not give him any leading questions. 

Well, Hector, it is easy for me, without any evidence other than in the files you have sent, to sit back and try to pick apart what might have happened. I can also suggest some new leads and new thoughts, I shall be satisfied.

It begins to look as if I shall do the children's book on UFO's. If so, I shall want to get as much photographic material from you as I possibly can.

With my very best regards and many thanks for your continued interest in my evaluations, I am,
Cordially yours,
