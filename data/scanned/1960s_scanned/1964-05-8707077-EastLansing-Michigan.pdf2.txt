The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report that includes a textual description of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. The text describes the observation of a bright, silver-disc-like object flying at 45 degrees over East Lansing, Michigan.

Text from the document:

OBSERVAT. JON:
While sitting behind a desk in the lounge at Shaw Hall, M.S.U., East Lansing, they spotted a silvery disc, flying south at 45 degree angle. After a very short time they saw a white flash, then lost sight of the object. The sky was clear of cloud cover at time of observation.
