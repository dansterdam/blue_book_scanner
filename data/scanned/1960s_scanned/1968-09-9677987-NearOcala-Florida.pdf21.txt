The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a typed document that discusses a UFO sighting near Ocala, Florida.

equilibrium, much less sight things, you know, but I did see a bright light
similar to the one that we saw over Ocala. You see, by this time we were
over 4 populated areas and many, many lights on the ground, and I told them
I couldn't positively identify anything because I did see one bright
light that seemed to descend very quickly when we turned, but I don't know.
I wouldn't even . .

Now, if this were the same thing, then Palm Beach radar should have
seen their radar image descending.

Well, Miami should, I don't think West Palm has any radar.

What I'd like to know is whether Miami had both you, in your 180-degree
turn and the object.

Well, now, I don't know. I assumed they did, because they were tracking
us and they said they had this object behind us, so you just have to discuss
that with them.

Well, I think actually the important sighting is the earlier one,
Well, they're both important, the radar part, of course, if we could establish
that this was actually a simultaneous visual-radar, but those are very
difficult to establish positively.

Well, as I understand, there are many cases where these things have been
sighted but radar did not pick them up. Now, if this is some kind of
machinery that we don't know about, somewhere else, they obviously have powers
beyond, to scramble radar, so I don't know.

I want to ask one other thing, here. When you were approaching Ocala
and saw the white light, that was presumably not the green light, the green 
light had gone now ...

Right, this is true.
