The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram. It depicts a grid-like coordinate system, with a utility water tower labeled "Casselberry Utilities Water Tower" and a "Strong Light" object at a specific location. The diagram also includes annotations describing the movement or behavior of the object, such as "Object appeared to get weaker in intensity - as if too moving, or having moved away from our position (approx. 8:30 p.m.)." There is also a mention of the "Movement of 'Cosmic' star," which may have varied slightly from the object.

The image does not contain any human faces or identifiable individuals.
