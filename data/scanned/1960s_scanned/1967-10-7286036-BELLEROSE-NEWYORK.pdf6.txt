34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  7   October 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
It appeared to be following a jet plane at an altitude probably about 35,000 feet. It was dim and barely visible at times. It was much higher than the jet plane and seemed to be moving faster than the jet. The most remarkable thing about it was its apparent ability to maneuver. It appeared to be able to move up, down, and from side to side with great speed and agility, a motion unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. I had also seen a similar object on a previous occasion at a lower altitude, but was unable to get a photo of it more representative.
I realize that this is still rather sketchy consideration, but I trust it may be of some use to your study. I am all most sincere in the observations I have reported.
Thank you for your consideration of this matter.
Sincerely yours,
