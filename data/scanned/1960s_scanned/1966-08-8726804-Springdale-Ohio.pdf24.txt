Last Friday (August 5) 1966 (and 4 friends) sighted 5 UFOs organized in a line, very bright and hovering something hovered for about 15 minutes. At times the 5 UFOs would go on and off - you may think that it is just lights blinking on and off for about a minute instead of a complicated report on it 1 is that 5 UFOs hovered and maneuvered in a line on the horizon for about a minute. Instead of a complicated report on it I shall describe what I saw.
