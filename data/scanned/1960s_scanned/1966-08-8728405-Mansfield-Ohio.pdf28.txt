The text of the document is as follows:

Sighting by: August 13, 1966

Witness: Air Tran manager of Flying Service, Kent County Airport, Grand Rapids, Michigan, telephone [redacted]

The Report: The witness was flying to Madison from Grand Rapids, and had just finished a radar-controlled approach to Milwaukee when he first saw the object to the north of his course west, and the object was at 3 o'clock relative to his heading. [Redacted] describes it at that time as consisting of concentric rings, clear and sharply outside white, next bright fluorescent green, then 5 o'clock on the object was a gray wedge, like a slice of pie.

[Redacted] then contacted radar control again and asked to be picked up; making identification burn, radar approach control at Milwaukee said they had him. He then asked if there was any other traffic in the area, and the answer was affirmative: something was 25 miles north, and appeared to be approaching the object. The witness watched the object become larger, and was informed that the object was now 6 miles away and had turned to fly parallel with him. At this time the apparent size of the object was equal to one foot at one mile. He says that if 12 were in fact six miles away as the radar controller reported, it must have been "forty stories high". 

During the next 10 to 12 minutes the object kept due north of the airplane travelling parallel with it, at 135 miles per hour. It gradually developed indistinct edges and became fuzzy all over. Radar tracked it all the way to Madison. [Redacted] prepared for his approach.
