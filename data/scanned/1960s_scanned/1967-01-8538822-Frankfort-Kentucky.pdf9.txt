FEB 28 1957

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

Your letter of January 26, 1957 concerning several unidentified flying objects (UFO) sightings by your husband and other individuals was referred to this office. 

This office has received several reports of a blue-green cloud on the morning of January 15, 1957. These other reports were from Georgia, Tennessee, and other individuals. A thorough investigation into the matter was conducted and the report indicates that the sightings were apparently the result of a meteor that exploded over Georgia at that time. A two stage missile trail launched at approximately 5:43 a.m. CST January 15. At an altitude of approximately 90 miles, the ballistic missile was ejected. This produced an enormous amount of ionized gas that was visible for a considerable distance.

The military and scientific information critics at Eglin informed this office that the trail of the earth's magnetic field and was visible for approximately 30 minutes.

The description in the news clipping you provided is quite similar to the reports concerning the January 15 early morning observation. Upper atmospheric research studies have shown this type of tyre atmospheric phenomenon for numerous UFO observations.

As for the other sightings, I can offer no comments without additional information. If you have any additional information that would complete the enclosed FID Form 126 on your successive night observations, an evaluation will be attempted.

Sincerely,
[redacted]
