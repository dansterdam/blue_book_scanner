"Project Blue Book
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Case
Ohio

To whom it may concern:

On the evening of June 21, at approximately 9:25 pm my friend and I observed an aerial object in the night sky east of our house. It was a slow moving object, straight down the middle of the sky approximately 1000 feet high. Shortly after it was first sighted, it began a slow approach toward the north, then abruptly stopped dead for approximately 5 minutes. At this point, it remained stationary, then suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed, making no sound, and vanished from sight in a few seconds.

The object was approximately 30 feet in diameter, circular in shape and very bright. It remained visible for about 3 hours. As it was leaving, it gave off a flash of light that illuminated the entire sky for a radius of at least 5 miles. At that time, it was on the northern horizon and we could see it plainly. Its rate of acceleration was such that in a few seconds, it had disappeared completely from view. We feel quite certain that this was not the usual and familiar aircraft that we see on any given night in the skies over our area."
