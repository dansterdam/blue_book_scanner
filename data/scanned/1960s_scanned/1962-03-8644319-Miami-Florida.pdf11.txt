"Having the 4-inch atrograph opened in the immediate area to photograph them. As they disappeared in the bright, overcast conditions, the shutter stayed open for approximately 15 - 20 seconds.

Second Observation:
On March 5, 1962 I was observing in search of Comet Seki, but a deep haze in the south hindered my observation. I noticed a bright object in the south-west, low on the horizon. At 8:35 p.m. when I opened the shutter of the f/2.5 35mm camera for a timed exposure of 35 seconds, I observed in the center of the field a luminosity (apparent diameter 3-4 minutes of arc) that appeared to be a solid object in motion. This motion was uniform and not due rotation. They were red-orange in color and seemed to be of low altitude. After 10 seconds they crossed the sky, disappearing to the north-west in the haze. The observation lasted 17 seconds.

I trained my 7X50mm binoculars on them, finding them strikingly star-like nucleusus. Extremely small discs could barely be distinguished in the 7X50 binoculars.

The photograph shows three 1-6 magnitude objects (the field objects forming overlapping trails on the film.) After a fifth object was visible, the photograph shows only the blurred images of that which was.

I am enclosing the photograph of my second observation.

Respectfully,"
