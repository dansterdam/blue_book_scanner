The image appears to contain a large compass-like diagram and two smaller sketches. The compass-like diagram appears to be used for charting the motion or trajectory of a reported phenomenon. The two smaller sketches seem to depict landscapes or scenery related to the reported sighting.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

NOW IMAGINE YOURSELF AS IF YOU ARE AN OBSERVER WHEN SOMETHING STRANGE IS FIRST SEEN. PLEASE A
DIAGRA INDICATING THE APPARENT MOTION AND POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. ALSO I
INDICATE THE ELEVATION (ANGLE ABOVE THE HORIZON) AND AZIMUTH (BEARING - COMPASS DIRECTION TO
INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF MOTION. PLEASE DRAW THIS DIAGRAM IN THE SPACE PROVIDED BELOW.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "O" AT THE 
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. IF THE MOTION WAS STRAIGHT, CURVE OR ZIG-ZAG, INDICATE THIS 
APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE 
THIS SKETCH.
