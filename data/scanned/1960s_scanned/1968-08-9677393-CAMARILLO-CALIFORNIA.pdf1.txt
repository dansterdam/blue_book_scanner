PROJECT 10079 RECORD
1. DATE-TIME GROUP 29/07/1968
2. LOCATION CAMARILLO, CALIFORNIA
3. SOURCE CIVILIAN
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS 1
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION 9 SECONDS
6. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observers at one point described the light as brightly illuminating a large flat object, somewhat larger than a 100 foot airliner. No mention is made if there were any marks or not. Also, the object is described as giving the appearance of 100 feet in diameter but it could have been considerably larger. The sighting may have been of a plane, a meteor, or a UFO as given in AFR 80-17. All that can be said is that there is not enough information to determine what the light was attached to.
10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
