UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO)
REPORT NO.        (CENTRAL TEXAS CASE)
ORGANIZATION: 2169 HOURS (CENTRAL STD) 11 MAY 1961, WICHITA FALLS, TEXAS AND SHEPPARD AFB, TEXAS
A newspaper clipping from the WICHITA FALLS RECORD NEWS, dated 12 May 1961, concerning a report of an unidentified flying object seen over Wichita Falls, Texas, and Sheppard AFB, Texas, on 11 May 1961. 
The clipping states that several persons reported seeing a bright light in the sky at about 2100 hours on 11 May 1961. The light was observed for about 30 minutes. It was described as much larger than a star, changing colors, and moving about erratically.
AP Form 112 instead of ATIC Form 104, because this organization does not have ATIC Form 104.
