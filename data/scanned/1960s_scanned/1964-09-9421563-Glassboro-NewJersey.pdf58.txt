HEADQUARTERS
1341TH AIR TRANSPORT WING (MATS)
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey 08041

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)

TO: Commander, Aeronautical Systems Division (AMAD) ATTN: ASRMF-19
Patterson AFB, OHIO

1. An investigation was conducted by this Wing with the cooperation of the Glassboro Police Department regarding an incident which occurred on 4 Sep 64. A local teenage boy launched a homemade rocket which appeared in a Philadelphia newspaper. (see attachments) and various information was gathered by this Wing and the Glassboro Police department.

2. Our investigation team was unsuccessful in locating the individual who launched the rocket vehicle on this date. Interviews with the Glassboro Police and with the local populace revealed that the rocket vehicle was homemade and appeared to have been launched from a local area junk yard. No pieces of the rocket vehicle were recovered or examined by a forensic analyst for any residue that might indicate the type or character of the propulsion material used. The police claimed to have gathered the expended material and disposed of it. This was an unfortunate situation as we were unable to conduct any meaningful analysis of the incident.

3. A discrepancy in this nature does not contain enough of a conclusive nature to warrant further intensive investigation.
