SUBJECT: Evaluation of UFO Report from Dow AFB, Maine

TO: TDEW (Lt Col Friend)

1. There are two targets visible on the scope, two of them following identical tracks at a varying angle at constant speed. All these tracks are traveling at the same speed - 1400 mph.
2. It would appear that visual lighting of at least one target would be made (at 'noon') since all targets come within 2 miles.
3. Since the "targets" were not seen visually or on any other means (radar or similar), it cannot be considered as visual sighting as well as radar observation.
4. Since only range and azimuth data was submitted. The range on the scope was not indicated but is assumed to be between 5 and 25 miles on the scope. Altitude data was not submitted. The range is said to be between 5 and 25 miles, which would be approximately 3 to 15 miles actual distance, as well as radar operation.

Case No. 23 - I don't feel there was sufficient information to corroborate electronic interference.
