There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains handwritten text that appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Here on tuesday, june 27 at about 10:30 pm a local resident reported seeing a bright light in the sky. The light was observed steadily for about 2 or 3 minutes, then it started to move and disappeared. The witness said it moved very fast and was a very bright round or ball of light. An area a foreign object it would surely be very bright. So it just figured it was a star or satellite.

But later on during the week I was told to hear about a similar object being seen in this area. An alleged could the time be the same.

sorry it didn't get you sooner.
