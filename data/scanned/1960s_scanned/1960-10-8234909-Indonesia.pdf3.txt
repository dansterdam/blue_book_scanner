The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that contains handwritten text and two illustrations or sketches of unidentified flying objects.

The text reads as follows:

OF ROUSING UFO REPORT THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY A FORMER MILITARY OBSERVER WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN A "SATELLITE OR ATOMIC POWER VEHICLE" HOVER FOR SEVERAL MINUTES OVER INDONESIA. PERSON WHO SUBMITTED REPORT STATES THAT HE HAS PARTICIPATED IN CONFIDENTIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH VARIOUS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS REGARDING RECENT UFO SIGHTINGS. HE STATES THAT OFFICIAL STATISTICS INDICATE OVER 200 UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS HAVE BEEN SIGHTED OVER INDONESIA IN RECENT MONTHS. THE WRITER GOES ON TO INDICATE THAT AIR FORCE ATTACHMENT TO INVESTIGATE AND REPORT ON SIGHTINGS THAT EXPECTED OCCURRED. HOWEVER, HE STATES THAT TWO ACTUAL OBJECTS WERE THEN OBSERVED FROM EVERY ANGLE BUT WERE LOST FROM VIEW VERY RAPIDLY. PERSON SUBMITTING REPORT CONCLUDES BY STATING THAT THE OBJECTS DID NOT SEEM TO BE A SATELLITE OR ATOMOSPHERIC VEHICLE AND THAT POLICE HAVE CUSTODY OF OR FIILED TO POLICE CALL ABOUT THEM.
