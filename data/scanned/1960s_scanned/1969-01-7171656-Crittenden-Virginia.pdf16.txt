There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this document page. The document consists entirely of text describing an incident involving a loud sound heard by the witness and her neighbors.

On January 17, 1969 I wondered all day who else might have seen or heard what I had. When I got home I started looking for someone and was real discouraged in a way when I asked my neighbors next door. The wife stated "No" but she remembered her mother saying she had heard something. Sure enough the lady and her 5 year old granddaughter both had heard it. The lady stated "it had awakened the girl and both were frightened", but the lady did not look out of her window to see what was making the sound. She said that she wished she had. She said she would have had plenty of time to look. She wished she had since I saw what I did. She also stated that "it sounded as if it were coming through the roof". It sounded as if it was that low. I asked her what it sounded like and she explained to me fully that it had a varying sound and when it got to a point that she thought was directly over the roof it made a loud explosion and she didn't hear any more. This is something I did not hear (explosion). Well, I still couldn't sleep that night either very well. I was up early and out - I asked directly and called on the phone a few neighbors to ask if they had heard or seen anything. Finally during the evening, January 18, 1959, I found another neighbor and she stated "yes" and that "the sound was loud and varying and it was coming from almost right on the roof top and it also frightened her four year old daughter, and she also was scared but now wishes she had looked.

Well, I discussed my problem with a couple of aeronautical engineers in the business in which I work and they were very interested and wanted me to explain everything to them. I did, I drew a picture on the blackboard and described its motion. I had thought quite a bit about the sound and knew.
