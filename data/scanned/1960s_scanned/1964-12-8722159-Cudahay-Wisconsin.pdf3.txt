ATTN OF: TDEV

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (18 Dec 64, Cudahy, Wisconsin)

TO: Hq USAF SAPOR PB (Mr. [REDACTED])

1. Reference the attached letter from [REDACTED] reporting an unidentified flying object observed on 18 Dec 64 over Cudahy, Wisconsin.

2. Both the lunar eclipse of 18 Dec 64 was observed by many astronomers, and the observations could have been of some astronomical phenomena. Further explanations were made.

3. From the information which has been presented to us it seems that the description, as included, is in no way definitive. The description itself is not in accord with the flight path from northeast to south, unless there are changes in the course of the reported object.

4. Analysts are unable to determine the cause of his observation. However, we cannot assume there is any unusual object or phenomena was observed.
