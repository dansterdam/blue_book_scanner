The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch appears to be a compass rose with various angles and bearings labeled, as well as instructions for imagining an object moving along a path.

The text extracted from the image is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the arrow show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
