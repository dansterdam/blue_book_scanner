There is an interesting formation of clouds that I observed near Sebring, Florida around 8:00 PM on February 16, 1960. The clouds appeared to be arranged in a circular pattern, with a dark central area. The circular formation seemed to be rotating slowly. I watched the clouds for several minutes and they maintained this unusual configuration. I have never seen clouds arranged in this way before and it caught my attention. Let me know if you would like any additional details about my observation.
