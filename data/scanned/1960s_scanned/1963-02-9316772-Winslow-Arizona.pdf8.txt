GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA, FEBRUARY 5, 1963

Glendale, California, February 5, 1963. A UFO was spotted shortly before noon in the Hollywood area. Several persons in Glendale saw the object, but they knew of no weather balloons in the area. Although they had received several calls reporting the object, officials and the Federal Aviation Agency could not identify it. Witness J. Scribner, who works for Air Defense Command, described the object as maneuvering rapidly and of a silvery metallic appearance, but as far as he knew, no aircraft were in the area at about 11:45 A.M. Yet planes were sighted minutes after the object was seen. Officials are still investigating this incident. (Source: California.UFO.)
