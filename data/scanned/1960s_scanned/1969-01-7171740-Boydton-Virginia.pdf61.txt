Possible meteor impact of 30 January 1969 near Centerville, Ohio

Dear Mr Citron:

1. On the evening of 30 January 1969, between 7:30 and 8:30 PM EST, the observer found a hole in his back yard that is about 4 inches in diameter and about 7 feet deep. This hole had not been there the day before. He considered this office because he thought that the hole might have been caused by a meteorite. 

2. The observer's name and address is:
[redacted]

If you decide to contact the observer, please contact Lt Marano at this office also.

3. We would appreciate any comments you would care to make on the possibility of a meteorite causing this hole.
