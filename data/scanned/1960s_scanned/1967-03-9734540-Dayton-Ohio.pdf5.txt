The image contains a photograph of a page from an old UFO report document. The page includes a sketch and diagram related to the observed motion of an unidentified object. There is also text on the page, which I will now transcribe.

27. Use the following sketch, imagining that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the aircraft line to show how high the object appeared. Place a "B" on the horizon line to show how high the object appeared. Place an "C" on the aircraft line to show how low the object appeared when you first saw it. Place an "D" on the horizon line to show how low the object appeared when you first saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and an arrow to show the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
