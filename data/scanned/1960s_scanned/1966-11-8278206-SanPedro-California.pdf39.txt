This image does not contain a photograph, but rather it appears to be a page from a scanned document. The document is an official U.S. Air Force questionnaire, and it contains handwritten text describing an unidentified sighting in the sky.

The text in the document reads as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 20 Apr 62
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

FIRST SIGHTED IT IN THE SKY BECAUSE IT WAS BRIGHTER THAN THE SURROUNDING STARS. IT REMAINED LIGHT LONGER THAN THE SURROUNDING STARS AND MADE NO SOUND AS THEY KNOW WHAT IT WOULD BE.

BUT LIKE HUNDREDS OF IT BECAUSE IT COULD BE WATCHED OR IT MOVED STEADILY FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES AND SUDDENLY IT MOVED IN THE SKY AND REMAINED THERE SEVERAL SECONDS. IT APPEARED THEN IT DISAPPEARED, AND SOME TIMES WOULD SOME TIMES MOVE RAPIDLY SHOW. THE BRIGHTNESS OF IT SOMETIMES VERY BRIGHT, AND SOMETIMES QUITE DIM.

SOME TIMES QUITE STILL FOR ABOUT A MINUTE OR MORE TO THOSE AN NOT MOVE. BESIDE IT WAS NOT LIKE ANY OBJECT I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT AN AIRPLANE OR SATELLITE THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH.
