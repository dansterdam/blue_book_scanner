The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch depicts a horizon with angular measurements and a compass rose. There are instructions to the viewer, asking them to perform various tasks related to the sketch, such as placing markers on the curved lines, showing the height of the object above the horizon, and drawing a picture to show the motion of the object or objects.

Text extracted from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
