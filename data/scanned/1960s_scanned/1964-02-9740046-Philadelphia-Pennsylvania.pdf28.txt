Dear Sir,

On February 23 at 4:30 p.m., I saw a golden light for several minutes it was not o a steady course it was moving from east to west 6,000-6,500 feet. The object.No aircraft in sight.

The object was good when colored like a full moon, as it moved to the east it became darker. It went straight - no turning no maneuvering. No smoke, no halo, no sound.
