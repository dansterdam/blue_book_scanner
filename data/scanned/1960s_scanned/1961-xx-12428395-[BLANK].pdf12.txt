Unidentified Flying Objects

TD-E (Colonel Wynn)
1. On 15 November 1961, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, consultant to the UFO project, and Major Robert J. Friend, TD-E, appeared on the Wayne State University TV program "Unidentified Flying Objects". The program was a special presentation on the work of the United States Air Force's unidentified flying objects program. Another show, conducted in the manner of the Miss Wallace interview, was also taped for showing at a later date. The appearance of Air Force personnel on these programs was the purpose of the exhibits and resulted in approximately 1,000,000 viewers.

2. Regarding the proposed Congressional hearing on the USAF UFO program, Major Friend advised that General LeMay, Chief of Staff, USAF, that Congressman Grover Bates, Chairman of the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee, had informed him in a telegram that the hearing would not be held. The events which led to the decision that the hearing would not be held will be furnished in a story in a writing by the so-called "Insider" which resulted in a definitive public interest.

3. As a result of the indicated public interest, Mr. Robert J. Friend, Major, USAF, director of Project Blue Book, and Major Donald E. Keyhoe, director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, presented the Air Force view, and Major Keyhoe presented the views of his organization. Major Keyhoe's scheme to discredit the United States Air Force would not be a part of Major Keyhoe's cheap scheme to discredit the United States Air Force, and that those would not be hearing.
