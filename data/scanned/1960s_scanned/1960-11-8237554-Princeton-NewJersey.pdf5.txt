CASE REPORT DIGEST 20

THIS INFORMATION IS FURNISHED FOR YOUR EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER IT DOES OR DOES NOT WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

A PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM YOUR ORGANIZATION IN NEW YORK CITY FORWARDED TO THIS DEPARTMENT INDICATES THAT THEY HAVE INVESTIGATED THE CASE AND DETERMINED THE FOLLOWING:
ON NOVEMBER 8, 1960, AT APPROXIMATELY 8:20 P.M. THE WITNESS, A RESIDENT OF PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY, WAS DRIVING IN HIS AUTOMOBILE ON ROUTE 1, ABOUT 2 MILES SOUTH OF PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY.
HE OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY TO THE SOUTH, WHICH APPEARED TO BE HOVERING AND PULSATING. HE STOPPED HIS CAR AND WITH HIS BOY COMPANION, WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES.
DURING THIS PERIOD, THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE CHANGING ITS SHAPE AND MAKE OTHER MANEUVERS. IT THEN MOVED OFF TO THE NORTHEAST AT A SPEED WHICH APPEARED TO BE FASTER THAN ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
MR. WILLIAM G. SNARNLEY, CAPTAIN, ATC OBSERVER, WHO LIVES AT THE GIVEN ADDRESS, IS STATED TO BE THE WITNESS. HE REPORTED THIS SIGHTING THROUGH NORMAL CHANNELS. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THIS IS THE FIRST SIGHTING OF SUCH AN OBJECT BY THE WITNESS, WHO WAS PREVIOUSLY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH CRAFT.
HIS OBSERVATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE MANEUVERS AND BEHAVIOR OF THE OBJECT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE REASONABLY CONSISTENT WITH REPORTS OF SIMILAR SIGHTINGS IN THE PAST. NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND OF INTENTIONAL HOAX OR FABRICATION. THE REPORT STATES THAT THE WITNESS IS QUITE FAMILIAR WITH CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT AND THEIR MANEUVERS.
