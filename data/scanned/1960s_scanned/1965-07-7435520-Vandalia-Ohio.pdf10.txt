The image contains a photograph or diagram that appears to be related to a Project Blue Book UFO report. The diagram shows a sketch with instructions for the observer to mark the position of a sighted object and its movement over time. There is also a compass-like diagram in the top right corner. However, the image does not contain any human faces, so I will not identify or name any individuals.

TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT:
27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the horizon where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the horizon where the object was below the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
