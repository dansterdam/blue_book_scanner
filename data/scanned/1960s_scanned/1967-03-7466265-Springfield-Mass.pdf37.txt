Proposed reply to letters from July 15, 1967 (sighting Mar 30, '67)

Dear [redacted],

Regarding your recent letters addressed to Maj. Hately and Sgt. Henderson, this is regarding your observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Where the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer a high degree of explanation. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite lacking.

We would appreciate it if you could add more details concerning your observation, to your nearest military installation, at the time, an evaluation would have been possible.

Your information will be added to our present data.

Thank you for bringing your observation to our attention.
