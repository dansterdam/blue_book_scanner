Text from the document:
I was out of town that Saturday evening and didn't return until late Sunday. I saw the object when I arrived home about 11:30 PM. It just hovered there without changing position. I watched it for about 15 minutes. It was cigar-shaped, solid black, and about the size of a car. It made no sound at all and just floated motionless. I tried to shine my flashlight on it but it didn't seem to have any effect. After about 15 minutes it just disappeared as though it had been turned off. I told my neighbor about it but he said he hadn't seen anything.
