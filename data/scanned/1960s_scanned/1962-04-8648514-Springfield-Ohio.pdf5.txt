DEAR MR.

Your completed questionnaire concerning an unidentified aerial object sighting has been forwarded to the Air Force for evaluation. Lack of specific data and corroborating information from additional witnesses prevents a definite evaluation of your sighting. In light of new evidence the Air Force would be happy to re-evaluate the case.

Statistical information on the Air Force's unidentified aerial phenomena program is forwarded for your information.

Sincerely, 

MARSTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
