The image does not contain any photographs, only illustrations. The illustration shows a sketch with an angular object above the horizon, and a compass rose diagram.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on the "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on the "A" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
