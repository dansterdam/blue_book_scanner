Dear Professor Hynek,

I received your letter and thanks for the efforts you have made in connection with the case. I was just as perplexed about the matter as you were, and I tried to find a rational explanation. However, the information that has been gathered so far indicates that an unusual object was observed in the Rocky Mountain area near Eureka, Utah, on April 8, 1962.

The details about two or three bright lights seen in the sky and their peculiar maneuvers have been reported, and it would be most helpful if you could get the opinions of your colleagues about these reports.

Sincerely,

P.S. The day my wife and I went to Vernon, we might have found someone to talk to about the report, but it seemed that information was being withheld from us. I think it may be our little outfit in the area that is being a little cautious in this matter. I do hope I can figure out a way to get more information.
