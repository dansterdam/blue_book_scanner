SUMMARY OF FACTS

Paint I. At first sighting of the dark end of the formation it was not giving off any visible surface. This happened as it neared the cloud formation and the vapor drifted to the North, according to my sight. However, I thought it was difficult to fly to the South as it disappeared and we can not agree.

Paint II. The vapor trail from the object was a great deal wider than an ordinary jet and wider than paint II had disappeared and should be discarded in the subsequent paints.

Paint III. The object appeared moving at a speed that I could not estimate and I could never the sight of the object with my two eyes. The object seen was a very large volume.

Paint IV. A very short time lapsed as object moved rapidly from left to right and then stopped again os shown in.

Paint V. There were no signs of other panels or jet trails in the sky below as the object was diving into two parts shown in clearly, the initial separation was indistinct and apparently positive to action.

Paint VI. As paint VI becomes to, and subsequently 5 as shown in closer or paint VII. Object should be more distinctly a globular shape.

At Paint 1 it is stated that the object did not continue to fall out speed to be absorbed and then disappeared into the cloud bank. At Paint II the object appeared to be divided into the distance or two smaller, (approximately) on horizon, if seemed with either light at some sluggish in Paint I delimitately appeared to be of material substance and not just a cloud formation.

Distance object traveled from Paint III to Paint IV where it shot forward seven times on a wider hat at one's length.
