1. I was contacted on the radio and told that there was a light that was seen in the sky a very brilliant light. I investigated this along with some other people in Kemah, Texas.

2. I realiy [sic] believe this scene a wonderful mystery dept. I am wondering if you could direct me.

If this really was any kind of craft, I wonder who was in it and what they were doing here on earth. Can you give me any information? I would appreciate it very much.

I had a beautiful memory of this, about two years ago. I lived 5 mile Nw. of Kemah, Texas. I am a commercial artist, and can draw what I saw, and am attaching a drawing to this letter. I wonder if you could direct me to the proper place.
