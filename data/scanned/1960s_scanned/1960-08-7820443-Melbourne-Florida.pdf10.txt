RE: UFO

Dear Sirs:

Upon making inquiry to the P. I. C. at Patrick Air Force Base, it was indicated your office.

On the night of August 18th, 1960, at 9:15 PM, a TS/T was observing the sky over the beach at Cape Canaveral. Suddenly, over the horizon, he observed a very bright light which was traveling in a northerly direction. This light was of an extremely clear brilliant white color, much brighter than any star or planet. It appeared to be approximately the size of the average star. 

The object maintained this brightness and appearance for approximately two minutes, then it began to slowly fade until it was no longer visible. There was no noise or smoke trail associated with this object. 

As the observer stated, this was an extremely clear night, and the object was easily observed against the dark sky. He is a fully qualified TS/T who has had many years of experience in observing and identifying aircraft in night sky operations. 

I trust that I have furnished the pertinent information on this incident. If you require any additional information, please let me know.

Your cooperation in making any information you may have available will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
