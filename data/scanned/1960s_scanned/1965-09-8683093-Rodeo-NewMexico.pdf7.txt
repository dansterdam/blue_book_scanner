They had been coming north on U.S.85 from Douglas and had just gotten past the small town of Rodeo and gulls when they noticed something peculiarly hovered like something they had never seen before. It was round and white and appeared to be about this 3 o'clock position where they first spotted it. It seemed to be hovering above the ground and then it went extremely fast and vanished into the clouds and it was pitch black. Their first impression was this was some kind of new aircraft they had not seen before. They said at about their 3 o'clock position what appeared to be a solid object which was hovering above the ground. After it made this quick movement into the clouds that it was pitch black.

They next realized that the lights were not exactly on the ground but at some slight distance above and not to their immediate left as earlier. This was a very low flying object. Less, he says that he is familiar with photographic missions and thinking this may be one, although it did not have the characteristics of any known aircraft. The motion that these objects were following a zig-zag pattern as they went up it seemed they were sort of milling around beyond the point at which the lights would presumably cross the road.
