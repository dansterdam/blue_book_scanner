The image does not contain any photographs, it is a handwritten report or document. I will proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document.

This handwritten report describes the sighting of an unidentified flying object near Kemah, Texas. It mentions a "round machine" that was observed for some time. The report includes details about the object's appearance and movements, as well as the observer's impressions and reactions. The text appears to be a detailed account of the UFO sighting.
