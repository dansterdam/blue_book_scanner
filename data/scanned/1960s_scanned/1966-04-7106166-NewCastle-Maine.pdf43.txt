UFO SIGHTINGS REPORTED 
FROM STOUGHTON TO QUINCY

These mysterious, red, white and purple-colored objects were sighted that night and that continued on into Quincy.

James Erickson, 48, of 106 Central Drive, Stoughton, was standing outside his house on Pearl Street, saw a purple glow and heard a hum. This was at 9 p.m.

Here is his description of the sighting: "An oval-shaped object, purple in color, was high in the air and came down to about the height of the utility poles."

The day said the white seemed to have three lights and that they moved in an up and down direction. The sound was high-pitched whine. The object then sped off and disappeared. The witness could not determine the size or shape of the object.
