Mr USAF SAYCIOC (Mr Hunt) 

We have received a report from Dr and Mrs. RUSSELL BRIGHT, 24 Larch Drive, Sturgis, Michigan that they believe they have observed a celestial object which has been determined to be the planet VENUS in the reported position of this object for the past month. However, they inform that the appearance of astronomical bodies are frequently distorted by atmospheric conditions such as inversions or haze.
