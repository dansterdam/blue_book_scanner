AT 1457 H 21 APR 61 AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED ON RADAR IN THE VICINITY OF CAPE CANAVERAL PRIOR TO THE LAUNCHING OF THE MERCURY 3 PROJECT, A POLARIS MISSILE, SCHEDULED T TIME 1433Z. THREE EXPERIENCED OBSERVERS WATCHED THE TARGET ON AN FPS-6 RADAR FOR 30 MINUTES AND ESTIMATED ITS SPEED AS RANGING BETWEEN 3,500 AND 4,500 KNOTS. THESE OBSERVERS REPORTED THAT THIS OBJECT PASSED 6 OR 7 TIMES ALONG AN AZIMUTH OF 120 DEGREES FROM CAPE CANAVERAL AND BETWEEN 10 AND 25 MILES FROM THE CAPE. THE RANGE OBSERVERS ESTIMATE OF THE HEIGHT OF THE UFO DID NOT AGREE, REPORTING EITHER THAT THE OBJECT WAS VERY LOW OR VERY HIGH. A RANGE SURVEILLANCE C-54 WAS VECTORED TO WITHIN 25 MILES OF THE OBJECT BUT REPORTS FROM THE CREW WERE NEGATIVE.
THE RANGE C-54 IS EQUIPPED WITH AN APS-42 AND AN APS-59 RADARS BUT UTILIZED ONLY THE APS-42 DURING THIS ATTEMPTED INTERCEPT.
