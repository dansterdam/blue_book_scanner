Dayton, Ohio

Dear Capt. Waldrop:

I wrote you once before about aircraft in my area when I was checking for a lady. Now I am checking for myself. I have already checked with both airfields at Terre Haute.

Two objects were seen traveling NE to SW at a high altitude. Crossed about 40 to 45 degrees of arc in one minute 43 seconds. The lights were white and stayed the same distance behind each other.

Respectfully yours,

P.S. Time was 11:45 p.m. C.D.T.
