The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document and contains no photograph, only a diagram and text. The diagram shows a chart with angles and a compass rose. The text on the page provides instructions for the viewer to imagine a scenario and draw a picture according to the provided instructions.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you felt it was at its highest point. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
