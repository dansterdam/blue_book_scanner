The image appears to be a page from an old document that contains text, but no visible photograph. The text discusses a sighting of something that was observed in the sky, described as looking like "Headlights reflecting off a cloud". The observer mentions that it appeared to be "sinking below a mountain before tonight's event occurred" and that it disappeared with the same general area that some "people who came in later also saw this before sunrise".
