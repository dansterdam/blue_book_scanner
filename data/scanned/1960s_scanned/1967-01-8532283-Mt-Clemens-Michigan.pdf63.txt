The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes -- just disappeared.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: silent
b. Color: several white lights - 1 green light are startboard lights

18. We wish to see the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Perhaps 1/4 to 5/16 - slowly disappeared to the west.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.
I can't say it was an object I was seeing. 
Cluster of bright white lights
Green light - very bright
Hovered 5 to 5 1/2 - slowly disappeared to west
