REPLY TO 
ATTN OF:   TDSA
SUBJECT:   Request for UFO Information

TO:       HQ USAF (AFCIN-4E2) (Mrs Gallus)
          WASH 25 D C

1. Forwarded are the attached letters requesting information on unidentified flying objects.

2. The objects observed from Cincinnati on the evening of June 8 1964 consisted of about 25 bright lights moving in a horizontal line across the sky. These lights appeared to blink on and off and to change relative position with respect to one another. Several witnesses estimated the objects to be at an altitude of 10,000 feet and moving in an easterly direction at an estimated speed of 600-700 mph. This sighting was investigated and no explanation for this phenomena could be determined.

3. The sighting was reported to the ATIC at 0215 hours. Standard form 14 is passed herewith. This sighting, if valid, may be attributed to an illusion. This portion of the sighting was probably caused by the reflection of lights through atmospheric disturbances.
