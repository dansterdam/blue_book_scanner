Vineland, New Jersey

Thank you for your fine letter reporting your sighting of an unidentified flying object on june 11, 1966. Your detailed description of the object was very clear.

As you may know the military has established a U.F.O. screening at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio - their primary research facility in this matter. Information on objects sighted is forwarded to them.

I have forwarded your letter to the screening center. If they need any additional information they will contact you directly. Your interest in this matter is indeed appreciated.

Sincerely yours,
M. R. CHARLES
Commanding Officer
