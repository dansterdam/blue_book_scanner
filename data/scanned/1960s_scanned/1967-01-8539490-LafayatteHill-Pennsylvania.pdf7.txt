The image appears to be a photo analysis report from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The report contains a photograph, but no human faces are present.

The text in the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 67-34

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ANALYSIS 
LOCATION: LAFAYETTE HILL, PA.
DATE: 18 January 1967

PHOTOGRAPHY:
AF: - 
PR: 8x 35mm slides
QUALITY: -

1. PURPOSE: This report is written in response to Work Order Number 67-44 submitted by Major DONALD E. KEYHOE, requesting analysis of six slides to determine what they depict.

2. ANALYSIS: The six slides submitted are from two separate processing dates. Five slides, apparently processed on 17 January 1966, were assigned processing number 17, and one slide, apparently processed on 18 January 1967, was assigned processing number 1. The image located near the center of slide number 17, the results of a processing defect, is a possible object "of a processing defect". When viewed under 50 power magnification, three apparent objects having a January 1967 processing date, are a very interesting anomaly and deserve a detailed analysis and a satisfactory explanation as to their origin.
