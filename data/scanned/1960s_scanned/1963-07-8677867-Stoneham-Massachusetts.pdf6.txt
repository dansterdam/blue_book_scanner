The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions. The diagram appears to show the path and direction of an unidentified object, with a compass-like symbol in the bottom right corner.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the given line to show how high the object was above the horizon (by-line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the line to show where the object was when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
