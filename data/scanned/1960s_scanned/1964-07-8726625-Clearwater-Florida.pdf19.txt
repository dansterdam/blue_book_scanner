Text from the document:

The witness of the account was interviewed. The object was first sighted very low on the north horizon and appeared to be brightly lit, larger than a star, and oval in shape. As it moved in a westerly direction, it suddenly increased in size and brightness and appeared to give off a bluish-white light. It seemed to hover for a short period, then decreased in size and brightness and finally disappeared from sight. The witness estimated the total time of observation to be about one minute.
