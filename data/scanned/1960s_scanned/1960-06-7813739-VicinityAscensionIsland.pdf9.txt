Dear Sir:
In answer to your letter of 28 June 1960 regarding an unidentified flare of light observed during 1962, I would like to state the following:
While I was setting up for pictures of the small boat I saw a flare of light which to me looked like a flare from an aircraft. This light was stronger than the blue-white termination of the brightness on the cassette. It was yellowish in color. It was back of the cassette and about 2 inches off the starboard bow as we approached. The cassette was clearly visible about 15 degrees off the starboard beam the shop.
I was with the first Mate of the Ship at the time and I mentioned him and said that the A/C flare was dying out, that was we still visible for the recovery.
I thought nothing more of this, as I expected this was routine coverage, and went ahead and shot pics of the recovery. Small diagram of position I sighted the flare-----------
Sincerely yours,
