AP IN: 32126 (24 FEB 67)
FT. VISIBILITY: 15 MLS. CLOUD COVER: PARTLY CLOUDY, SCATTERED.
PART VII - COMMENTS OF INVESTIGATION OFFICER: ACTING INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, IN MY ESTIMATION, THIS OBSERVER VERY DEFINITELY DID SEE SOMETHING VERY OUT OF THE ORDINARY. THIS REPORT IS INCOMPLETE DUE TO THE INABILITY TO GET COMPLETE REPORTS ON SIX (6) OTHER WITNESSES TO THIS SAME EVENT. THE LIMITED INFORMATION I HAVE INDICATES THAT ALL SEVEN REPORTS COINCIDE IN THE BASIC APPEARANCE OF THE UFO. FURTHER INFORMATION ON THESE SIGHTINGS IS AVAILABLE AT YOUR REQUEST.
