COMMENTARY ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
(CASE HISTORY)

HUNTLEY-BRINKLEY (Cont'd)
Circa 6:40 PM CMST 1 March 1966 on the CBS TV News -
"CHIEF HUNTLEY: This appears to be from Hicn. to Mich. from
Harding to Red Wing, Minnesota. Flashes of light were seen going
upwards and then downwards near a small town named 1LCA. The
sightings would simply perplex the local PEOPLE in the MINNESOTA
town. This type of incident is being investigated in
the AF in the MINNESOTA area. The Air. Force says this
light seen by a number of . people in the area
apparently is not related to anything known at this time.
Whatever it was, it remained a mystery.
BRINKLEY: And we don't know. Apparently, we don't know how many
PAVNS are there. We just don't know.
HUNTLEY: And the, fight, And the, lit, And the PILOTS who reported
seeing them last night to the FAA in those areas, they just don't know
how many FAVNS are there. We just don't know. We'll have to wait
for the Air Force to support them with further explanation to see
what the PAVNS are."

BURLINGTON: What all have you got there?

HUNTLEY: BURLINGTON: We had a report of some kind of flash in the
sky in the BURLINGTON area. Are you, a, little .car baffled on
that?

BURLINGTON: Now, this is your first reaction, HUNTLEY. We
have nothing to report here in BURLINGTON on UFO sightings.
We had no reports whatsoever. There were approximately
two and a half seconds of a bright flash here, but that's
all we know.

HUNTLEY: BURLINGTON: And what was your reaction to that?

BURLINGTON: Well, I'm scared, damned scared. I'm, I'm
really concerned, we're all, in this position, frankly,
damned scared right now. But we know we can't panic.

HUNTLEY: This BURLINGTON: And there, . and the helicopter pockets
pounded the air... We know that somehow we are all living
with a situation that has great mystery to it. And
if there are any unidentified flying objects in the
sky, that are not just part of the planet we living from,
then find feeling from three sides, scared, you bet your
life we are. Were found in the VC position along
with half a dozen others. Were found there. The entire
platoon was hit hard. There was an intense barrage._
The snipers had obviously zeroed in on the platoon there.
There had been evacuated during the last operation. Those
who were left survived. But we know, we just plain and
simple don't know how to evaluate all this.

HUNTLEY: Villages this time. One hamlet was evacuated
and supposedly surrounded. We just plain simply don't
know how to evaluate all of this. BURLINGTON: And
right, and supposedly surrounded.
