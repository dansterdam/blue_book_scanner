IV. SPECIAL POINTS OF INTEREST:
A. Sebring Florida incident - January 24, 1967

1) A Group A2 jet was in the area, the moving object was noted approaching the plane as it was identified by the tower and pilot as a rotating, pulsing UFO. (Approximately 30 minutes duration)

2) When Group A2 jet was approaching to check the object, the object started moving rapidly away from the jet and the jet was unable to close the gap. The object was seen by the tower, ground crew, and the pilot of the jet. (Approximately 10 minutes duration)

3) As the jet closed in, the object would suddenly accelerate up, down, or sideways at a very high rate of speed. This was noted on more than one occasion with the object disappearing and reappearing in a different location. (Approximately 10 minutes duration)

4) The two jets were unable to get a constant locked on with their radar on the object.

5) The director of the airport stated that he personally saw the object and it was a large, intensely bright light that would suddenly accelerate and disappear. He said it was unlike anything he had ever seen before.

V. COMMENTS:
When the object was considered to be a threat to the area by the USAF, the jets were scrambled and the object was pursued. However, the jets were unable to get a solid lock on the object and it was able to accelerate and disappear at will. This incident was considered to be among the most credible and intriguing of the recent UFO sightings reported.
