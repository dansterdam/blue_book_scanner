K. The two observers as well as several neighbors have made numerous sightings of UFO's since 31 March 1966. There have been few nights since 31 March until the date (25 Apr 66) of this report when sightings have not been made. Sightings have been made simultaneously with identified aircraft passing through the area. They have also been seen under varying weather conditions, including rain showers.
Aircraft may account for a few of the objects but certainly not all of them.
