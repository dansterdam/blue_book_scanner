The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document. There is no photograph present in this particular page. The text at the top of the page reads "AFR 80-17(C1)" and the instructions state "INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT, BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONLINE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING." The rest of the page is blank, with handwritten notes at the bottom.
