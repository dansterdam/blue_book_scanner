Dear Sir:

On the night of Aug. the 3rd of this year I saw a strange object in the sky. It was about 25 west above the horizon & the sky was clear & bright. The object was moving very fast at a tremendous speed, at first I thought it might be a shooting star, but as I watched it moved across the sky in a rather zig-zag motion and it was larger than any shooting star I have ever seen.

As I watched, it suddenly stopped and remained stationary for a few seconds, then it suddenly took off again in a different direction at an incredibly high speed and was out of sight in a few seconds.

I first got the impression that it was reflecting some light, possibly sunlight, as it seemed to flash and glitter, but I noticed that the sky behind it seemed to be visible through it as it moved, so it was not reflecting light, but rather seemed to be emitting its own light.

I called to my wife, and she too saw the object in the sky and confirmed what I saw. We watched it for several minutes until it disappeared.

I was amazed at the speed and maneuverability of the object and would appreciate any information you could give me about it. Was it some kind of experimental aircraft, or was it something else? I would be very interested to know if anyone else reported seeing this object in the sky that night.

I hope you can give me some information about this sighting. I have not reported it to anyone else, as I did not know who to contact.

Yours truly,
