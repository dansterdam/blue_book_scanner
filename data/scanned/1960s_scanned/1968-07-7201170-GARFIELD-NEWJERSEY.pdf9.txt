AFR 80-17(C)

THIS PAGE CONTAINS NEGATIVE STATEMENTS OF IDENTIFICATION AND INDICATES THAT NO PHOTOGRAPH CONNECTED WITH THIS CASE IS AVAILABLE OR THAT ANY PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN HAVE BEEN LOST, MISPLACED, OR DESTROYED. IT ALSO INDICATES THAT NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THIS PARTICULAR CASE IS CONTEMPLATED UNLESS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS RECEIVED.

THIS WAS THE ANGULAR NOISE SHOW TO HAVE BEEN A BRIGHT START THAT, ALTHOUGH BRIGHT, WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN BRIGHT ENOUGH TO BE TAKEN FOR A UNUSUAL LIGHT BY THE WITNESS. NOTHING WAS FOUND WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT ANY PHENOMENON OF UNUSUAL NATURE COULD HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY THE WITNESS.
