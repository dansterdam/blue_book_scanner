A starting light didn't move but went straight down - a very bright object that seemed to be self-luminous and was diamond-shaped. It was quite hovering - very high and at some distance at a high rate of speed. I tried to attract attention as some other persons appeared to be outdoors at the time. The light seemed to be unusual and very high to the right of the observer's house.
