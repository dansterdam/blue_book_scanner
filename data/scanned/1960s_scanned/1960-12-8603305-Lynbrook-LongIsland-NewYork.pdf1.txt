9. FURTHER COMMENTS
Radar and visual sighting. Small object on radar. Full and the same color as the background lighting. It seemed to move rapidly and then hover for a short time and then disappear.
10. CONCLUSIONS
Size of the object was reported to be very small. The ground radar made a positive detection and at the same time it was visually observed. The ground radar was not operating in the area at the time it would have been normally. The movement and disappearance of the object was erratic to say the least, appearing to be under intelligent control. There was absolutely no explanation for the sighting.
