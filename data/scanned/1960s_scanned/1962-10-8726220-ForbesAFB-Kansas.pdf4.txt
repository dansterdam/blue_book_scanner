TEXT OF THE DOCUMENT:
52222 - 16 DEGREES CENTIGRADE 
52222 - NOT AVAILABLE
CLOUD COVER WAS SCATTERED AT 10220 FEET, VISIBILITY 9 MILE-
H. POSSIBLE EXPLANATION: CONSIDERING THAT METEOROIDS HAD ALREADY
BEEN SIGHTED, THIS WAS PROBABLY JUST AN UNUSUALLY BRIGHT ONE-
THIS IN LIGHT COULD HAVE BEEN MAGNIFIED IN THE AIRMAN'S MEMORY.
THE FACT OF THE YELLOW-ORANGE COLOR MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONLY CHEMICALS IN
THE METEOR.
