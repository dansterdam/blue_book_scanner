The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch and a compass diagram. The sketch depicts an object in the sky, with instructions to draw its motion and show any changes in direction during the course. The compass diagram appears to be a reference for the observer to determine the position of the object relative to the horizon.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" at the highest point where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
