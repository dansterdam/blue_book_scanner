The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch appears to be a compass rose with the 8 main compass directions labeled - N, NNW, NW, WNW, W, WSW, SW, and SSW. The smaller sketches on the right appear to depict a person standing in a landscape, with a curved horizon line in the background.

The text in the document is as follows:

6A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE COMPASS ROSE - PLACE AN "X" AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION WHEN LAST SEEN. THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO BE ESSENTIALLY STRAIGHT, CURVED ON 2/15/50. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS ITEM.
