AFR 80-17(C1) 
27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.
ALTERNATIVE PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

Gentleman:

First of all let me thank you for your cooperation and apologize to you for making your time and causing seemingly unnecessary paperwork.

Since my sighting of this phenomenon and the subsequent thorough investigation that I have made of the details of this incident, I have on previous occasions seen this same blimp in the Dayton area. However, I have always seen it there during daylight hours. When first I sighted this phenomenon, I was so intrigued by the sight of this blimp, however, that I undertook an extensive and careful study of the matter. Unable to locate the particular vehicle.

Even though I feel this report will be of no value to you, I feel it is my duty to fill it out. 

Although it is not pertinent to this report I would like to state that I am a person of the highest character and integrity. He was very kind, considerate, and helpful while talking the necessary information in a professional manner. Due to the nature of his assignment I imagine he was not too comfortable with my constantly playing with a pencil and trying to outline how he might have looked from my view point, however, if possible would you please have his Commanding Officer give him a personal "Thanks" for me.

Respectfully submitted:
