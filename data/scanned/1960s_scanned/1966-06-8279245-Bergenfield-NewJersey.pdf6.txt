The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a diagram and text instructions. The diagram appears to show a compass and directions for estimating the height and position of an unidentified object in relation to the observer.

Transcribing the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "B" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline). Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high you first saw the object. Place an "A" on the compass to show you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the motion and a "B" at the end, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw 3 pictures of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
