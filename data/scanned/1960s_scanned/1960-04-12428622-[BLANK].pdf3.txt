was rising at about that time.
Looking at the sky, he saw a huge, silent, motionless 
luminous mass, apparently suspended above the north bank
of the river some 300 yards away. "It looked," he said, 
"like a gigantic cigar standing on end. I had been
watching this amazing spectacle for a couple of minutes 
when suddenly from the bottom of the cigar came an object 
like a horizontal disk, which dropped at first in free 
fall, then slowed, and suddenly swayed and dived horizon-

For a very short time I could see the disk full-face; it 
was surrounded by a halo of brilliant light."
A few minutes after it had disappeared behind him, going 
southwest at prodigious speed, a similar object came from 
the cigar and went through the same maneuvers. A third object, 
and then a fourth—and finally a fifth detached itself from
the cigar which was still motionless. This last disk 
dropped lower than the earlier ones, to the level of the 
new bridge, where it remained still for an instant, swaying

circular form and its red luminosity—more intense at the

surrounding it. After a few second's pause, it wobbled 
like the first four, and took off like a flash toward the 
north, where it was lost in the distance as it gained alti-
