1. PID has received a letter from 2nd Lt. ... requesting analysis of a UFO sighting reported at Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin on 8 August 1961. The sighting occurred at approximately 11:30 p.m. and was reported to be too general in nature to provide a valid conclusion.
2. The report indicates that the object(s) observed were approximately the size of a baseball, spherical or slightly elongated in shape, and were observed to move as broken clouds moved with the wind.
3. Reports were received about two hours ago and did not establish positional fixes other than the USAF, 7th does not have photograph evidence.
