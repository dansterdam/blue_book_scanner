SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT

ON NOVEMBER 7, 1968, AT APPROXIMATELY 8:05 P.M., I OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE SKY NEAR ACTON, TEXAS. I WAS DRIVING EASTBOUND ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 20 WHEN I FIRST OBSERVED THE OBJECT. IT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 30-35 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON IN THE SOUTHWESTERN SKY. THE OBJECT WAS ILLUMINED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO BE COMING FROM THE CENTER OF THE OBJECT. THIS LIGHT PULSATED RHYTHMICALLY AT A RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 1 CYCLE PER SECOND. 

I OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. DURING THIS TIME, IT REMAINED STATIONARY AND DID NOT MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS OR CHANGES IN SPEED OR DIRECTION. I DID NOT HEAR ANY SOUND COMING FROM THE OBJECT.

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. I AM SUBMITTING THIS REPORT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION WHICH MAY BE OF VALUE TO YOUR DEPARTMENT IN INVESTIGATING REPORTED SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.

SINCERELY,

DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE
