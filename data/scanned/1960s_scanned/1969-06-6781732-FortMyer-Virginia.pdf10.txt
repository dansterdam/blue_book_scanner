The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch and accompanying text. The sketch appears to be a single object, possibly a UFO or other unidentified aerial phenomenon, with some notes and measurements written next to it.

The text in the document says:

TO DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT INDICATE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR TELEPHONE POLE, NOT HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAD BEEN STANDING WHERE THIS PHENOMENON WAS SIGHTED, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE FULL MOON OR SUN IT WOULD HAVE COVERED.
