Transcription of the text in the document:

Although we are unable to positively identify the stimulus, we believe this sighting to be the result of a natural or scientific phenomena. The planet Venus has been responsible for numerous UFO sightings since spring. Venus has been responsible for numerous primary sightings why it has been mistaken for other things.

The sighting by Mrs. XYZ does not appear to be the same sighting as yours. It appears to be something operating on ground level. We have not received any additional reports for this sighting. Our investigation indicates that this sighting by Mrs. XYZ was not a flying object but something operating on ground level.

Sincerely,
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
