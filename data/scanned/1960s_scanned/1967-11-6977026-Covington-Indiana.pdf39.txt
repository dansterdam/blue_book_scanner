Text from the document:

ON 2 JAN 68, M. Covington, Indiana, a neighbor, had told him that men similar objects on 18 Nov 67. For interview, The Montgomery County Police, Fountain County Police, and the Indiana State Police in Lafayette, Indiana, were contacted. All replies were negative. However, it should be noted that on other dates several sightings of unidentified objects in the area were made to state police. Also, the LaFayette, Indiana State Police on 19 Nov reported a sighting of a red revolving light moving slowly to the south. The sighting was about Pine Village, Indiana. In an interview with M. E., the Smithsonian Institute Astrophysical Survey revealed that their cameras is pointed in the direction from Covington toward Decatur and it showed no unidentified object. It is interesting to note that a video tape during a scanning on approximately 9 Nov 1967, revealed two (2) identifiable objects. This information is included to point out that other graphed unidentifiable objects were in the area at about the early part of November 1967. A film of this video tape was obtained by Wright-Patterson AFB for proceeding; however, it has been returned.
