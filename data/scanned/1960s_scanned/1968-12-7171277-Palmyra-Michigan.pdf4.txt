This image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it contains the following illustrations:

1. A compass rose diagram showing the 8 cardinal directions (N, NNE, NE, ENE, E, ESE, SE, SSE, S, SSW, SW, WSW, W, WNW, NW, NNW).

2. Two sketches depicting a person's perspective from a particular location, with the horizon and surrounding landscape visible. The sketches seem to illustrate the movement or trajectory of a phenomenon being observed.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now extract all the text found in the document:

9A.  HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED.
7.  IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "B".  THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR SISSAG.  REFER TO THE EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS SKETCH.
