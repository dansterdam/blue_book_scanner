"Per your further information and reference, I am positive you meant very sincerely what you said. That kind of sincerity will get positive results.

The report is unsatisfactory filed to indicate a careful examination and analysis of all pertinent data on the part of the reporting officer. It lacks the usual complete details, descriptions and diagrams and other data needed for a thorough and complete analysis. Pertinent details and data which are missing and should be obtained are as follows:

"size, shape, color, metallic, luminosity, objects and other details", "flying maneuvers, tops speeds" by "flying sources", "other comments" by "[REDACTED]"

Definitive statements are lacking to indicate whether or not the sighting constitutes an astronomical, meteorological or other natural phenomenon and, if not, what possible man-made or other explanation there may be. The report is therefore lacking in the information and detail needed to determine the nature of the sighting.

An investigation by a qualified and disinterested Field Investigator, supported by documentary evidence, photographs, diagrams, and the usual complete details, is therefore requested in this particular case in order to obtain the essential information and data needed for a thorough and definitive analysis."
