The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the image:

I made a miniature U.F.O. of what I saw. It had 3 bellows looking objects on the side and was very bright, illuminated on the outside. The whole object was about 25 to 30 feet in diameter and hovered about 4 minutes.

It just seemed to hover in mid-air. I made more observations as follows: at any time during the sighting a small door on the side would open and close rather fast. As you see, a big light came out of this door which lasted about 3 to 4 seconds.
