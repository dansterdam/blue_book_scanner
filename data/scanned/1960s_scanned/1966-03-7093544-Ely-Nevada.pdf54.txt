The Sighting
At about 8:45 p.m. (time checked by both observers) two pilots reported seeing a bright light viewing almost directly overhead. At first, they thought it was a satellite, but it very quickly increased in size, from a small point to a very large object. The object appeared to be stationary, although the visual impression was that it was descending. It appeared to be disc-shaped, rather than round or elongated. The size increased in a matter of seconds from what would appear to be smaller than the moon to about 40 or 50 degrees of arc. As it increased in size, it became brighter, first appearing as a golden-white color, and then taking on a blue-white color, almost as bright as the full moon. The object finally shrank back to a small point of light and disappeared at the same position. The whole sighting lasted about 30 seconds.
