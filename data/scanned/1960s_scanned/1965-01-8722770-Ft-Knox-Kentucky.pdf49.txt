In the following sketch, indicate that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object. If the object was moving, place an arrow (-->) to show the direction it was traveling when you first saw it. Place an "R" on the compass where you last saw the object.

The diagram illustrates how to indicate the direction and movement of an object using compass markings.

2. This figure will show the motion path the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

3. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Give a sketch of how they were arranged, and put an arrow on any one to show the direction they were traveling.
