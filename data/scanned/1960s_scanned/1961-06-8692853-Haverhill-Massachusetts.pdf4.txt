Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear sir:

I have that reported sighting of a strange object in the sky on the evening of June 8, 1961, at Haverhill, Massachusetts. 

1) The object was seen to perform maneuvers which seemed to defy the laws of gravity and aerodynamics. It hovered, moved rapidly in various directions, and appeared to change shape.

2) The object emitted a bright light and at times appeared to be divided into sections.

3) The object was seen by several reliable witnesses, including a person who has had previous experience in observing and identifying aircraft.

4) The object was under observation for a considerable period of time.

5) The witnesses are certain that the object was not any known type of aircraft.

If you desire any further details, please advise.
