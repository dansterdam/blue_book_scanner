Hynek Explains Michigan's UFO Sightings; Swamp Gases And Male Pranksters Blamed

In the Hillsdale case, after the real sighting, Hynek said, certain young men played pranks with flares to the further distress of the witnesses.

The pictures were taken on a different night and in a different town and had no reference whatever to the other two sightings as originally represented, Hynek said.

"This is no new thing. It is like a jigsaw puzzle. There are a lot of pieces to work with, and to complicate the picture. Most of the time we are working with several jigsaw sets," he added.

"This is one purpose the Michigan sightings caused. We've had many more interesting cases, like in Exeter, New Jersey."

Sunday on Channel 11 at 6:30 p.m. Hynek will be joined by a panel of experts in a one-hour-long discussion on unidentified flying objects, primarily the Exeter case. "I had to laugh," he said it was an unusual way to spend a spring vacation, but said most of his investigations had to be sandwiched in between the school year requirements.
