The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was the US Air Force's project for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document states:

IN CHECKING REPORTS WHICH EXHIBIT SATELLITE CHARACTERISTICS WE GO
DIRECTLY TO THE SPACE DETECTION CENTER AT COLORADO SPRINGS. THEY HAVE
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRACKING ALL SATELLITE ACTIVITY. WE ALSO GO TO 
THE SPACE DETECTION CENTER FOR INFORMATION REGARDING SATELLITE DECAYS.

FOR REPORTS WHICH WE SUSPECT WERE CAUSED BY MISSILE FIRINGS WE GO
DIRECTLY TO CAPE KENNEDY, VANDENBERG, POINT MUGU, WALLOPS ISLAND, EGLIN, 
GREEN RIVER, AND OTHER MILITARY UNITS WHICH MIGHT BE ENGAGED IN SPECIAL
ACTIVITIES.

FOR ANALYSIS OF RADAR REPORTS WE USE AN ORGANIZATION AT WRIGHT-
PATTERSON OR CAN USE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE ENGAGED IN THIS TYPE
OF ACTIVITY.

FOR PHOTO ANALYSIS WE USE ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON.

FOR PHYSICAL SPECIMENS WHICH ARE SUBMITTED TO THE PROJECT OFFICE, WE
HAVE USED THE SERVICES OF THE AIR FORCE MATERIEL LABORATORY, BATTELE
MEMORIAL, PURE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, LIBBY OWENS AND CORNING GLASS,
THE NORTHWESTERN GEOLOGY DEPARTMENT, AND THE INSTITUTE OF PAPER CHEMISTRY.
