The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document describes an alleged UFO sighting near Cape Canaveral, Florida and Cuba. According to the document, the UFO was observed to have a circular shape, the same magnitude as Venus or Echo 1, a white color, and no sound was heard. The observer was watching a gas cloud in association with a missile launch. The object had an azimuth of approximately 335 degrees and faded in intensity slowly, disappearing.
