UFO SIGHTING, 25 MARCH 1966
HQ USAF SAPOCC (Mrs. Hunt)
Reference the attached letter from Edmund V. Sawyer regarding an observation which he made on 25 March 1966. The following is a suggested reply:
Dear Mr. Sawyer:
Thank you for your most gracious letter of 3 April 1966. The description which you gave is excellent. Unfortunately, the average observer is a poor observer; this has been confirmed time and again. However, your keen sense of detail, which makes our job much easier in identifying the stimulus which caused such sightings.
From the information you supplied, an aircraft appears to be responsible for your observation. The orange color probably was a reflector glow surrounding a reflector off the aircraft. The horizontal stripes were formed by the aircraft's contrail and the vertical glow reaches to a height of 15 - 20 degrees. This could account for the brilliant orange color.
We appreciate your interest in Project Blue Book and for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
