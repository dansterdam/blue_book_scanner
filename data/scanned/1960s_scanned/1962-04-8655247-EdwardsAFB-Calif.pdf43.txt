X-15 FOR STAR RESEARCH
The X-15, a rocket-powered aircraft, will be used as a platform for conducting astronomical and space science experiments in suborbital flight. The X-15 can reach altitudes of over 50 miles and provide periods of weightlessness for instruments and experiments. It is expected that the X-15 will be used for a wide variety of astronomical and space science research, including studies of star images, atmospheric phenomena, and cosmic radiation. The performance of the X-15 makes it a unique and valuable tool for star research and other space science investigations.
