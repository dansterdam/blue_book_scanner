The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather two sketches or illustrations related to a UFO sighting report.

The first sketch shows a curved line with instructions to "Place an 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it."

The second sketch contains a larger landscape illustration with two smaller illustrations. The larger illustration shows a road or path with buildings and trees in the background. The smaller illustration on the left shows a person standing on the path, while the smaller illustration on the right shows a more distant landscape view.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
