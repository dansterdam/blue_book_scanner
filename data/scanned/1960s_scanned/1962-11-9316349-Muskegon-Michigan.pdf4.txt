FIG. 1 MAP SHOWING LOCATION OF ANDROMEDA GALAXY -- M 31
(Continued from p. 274) The Andromeda Galaxy (which has the special name M31) is designated in this map as the "Great Square" near the center. The Andromeda Galaxy is considerably farther stars, and in that direction we can look beyond, and see the millions of other galaxies that can be photographed with large telescopes. This is Messier 31, or M 31, 15,000,000 light-years away, one of the nearest and largest of the extragalactic nebulae. It contains over 100,000,000,000 stars. The Milky Way is similar, but about 2,300,000 years its junior. This is avowed fact - for using the carbon 14 radio-active clock, that is the age determined to be. M 31 is a twin of our galaxy, the Milky Way. Many of the stars that appear to us to flow from the center to the edges are actually the outer portions of this gigantic spiral nebula, a grindstone about a hundred thousand light years in diameter. As we look in the direction of the center, we see condensed areas which have suffered blue-shift, indicating motion toward us, while those areas at the edges appear red-shifted, indicating motion away from us. This causes the effect of the Milky Way toward those sides of the grindstone there
