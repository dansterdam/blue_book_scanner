UFO Sighting, 27 Nov 55
Hq USAF SAFOIN (Mrs Hunt)
Reference the attached Letter from REQESTING
station on his unidentified observation. The following is a 
reply:
Dear Mrs Hunt,
It is not unusual for meteors to appear with a green coloration, however, it is unusual for them to appear to land so close to the observer as you described. In this case it would appear when in reality the same meteor was observed more than 300 miles away.
We have taken the liberty of forwarding your report to the American Meteor Society for possible correlation with other sightings which may have occurred in the New England area.
FOR THE COMMANDER
