There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text in the document is as follows:

"A clear sky with there was a good many stars and there are no moon. this is a strange tale of a straight line so it could not have been a star.

On Saturday April 20, 1968 we sighted it again coming from the direction that it had disappeared. we returned to the same place at the same time, we were the following night at the same place to see if it would return again, and it did at about the same time varying in the beams much more brighter than the first time, this one seemed to be moving in the east and then north, and we left at about 10:30 P.M. Father, much of this one has been written as we actually saw and watched it, and another that can be seen a better description of it."
