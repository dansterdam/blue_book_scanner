"D-9/15 Col Friend
UFOB Sighting
Rochester, New Hampshire

Dear Mr. Friend:

Reference is made to your letter of 30 April 1962 reporting the sighting of an unidentified flying object. Your letter contained information that led to a wild conjecture.

It is therefore requested that you and your wife will visit with EDWARD M. LYNN, Colonel, USAF, Deputy for Intelligence and Security, Department of the Air Force, in the near future. I thank you very much for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely

EDWARD M. LYNN 
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Intelligence
and Security"
