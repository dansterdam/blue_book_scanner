The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document describes various sightings and reports related to UFOs.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:
