Find UFOs Plastic Kites
GALESBURG (R) -Two unidentified flying objects, described as circular in shape and red in color, were observed about 7:30 p.m. Thursday by two Galesburg men and an East Galesburg woman, according to a report filed with the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book.
The objects, said to be about the size of a wash tub and located northwest of Galesburg, were visible for about 45 minutes.
The women said the objects appeared to be "plastic kites," while one man described them as "bouncing up and down" and the other said they had "a dull glow."
The report said the objects flew in a northwesterly direction and were lost from sight, leaving no trail. Several local citizens reported seeing the objects, said the report.
The local police department, the Galesburg Chamber of Commerce, and the local newspaper were notified of the sighting.
