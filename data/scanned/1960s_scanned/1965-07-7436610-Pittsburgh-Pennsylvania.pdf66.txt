Barquisimeto, Trujillo State, Venezuela.
On the 29th, a strange, round-shaped object was observed by many people in the afternoon. The object was estimated to be at about 15,000 feet altitude. The object took off with a trail of multicolored lights and after hovering over the city for a few seconds, it sped off, leaving a trail resembling a comet's tail, which remained in the sky for about a half hour after the sighting.
