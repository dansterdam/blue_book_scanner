"Dear Sir:  12 March, 1967
   I would like to report a sighting
of a UFO on the night of 5.1.67  The
object was observed over our house
for approx. ... 4 minutes.  It seemed
to have a flashing light and move up
and down in the sky.  This is the
first time I have ever seen anything
like this.  I hope you can give me
some information on what it could
have been.
Sincerely,  (name redacted)"
