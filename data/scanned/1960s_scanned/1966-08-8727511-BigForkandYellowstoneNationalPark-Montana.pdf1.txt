2. LOCATION Big Fork and Yellowstone National Park, Montana

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was observed on two different occasions a star-like object came from the western sky and in one case passed over the observers which was in another location. The object exhibited some varying motion with steady unchanging brightness and color. Due to the time lapse before the observations were reported to the AIR FORCE a comprehensive evaluation is not possible.
