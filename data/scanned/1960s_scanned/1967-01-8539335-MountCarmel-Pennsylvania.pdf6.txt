There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a handwritten document containing descriptive text.

I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

I soon got enough of this and decided to treat [it?] as a test [??] My life was endangered, and I thought [?] I had already gotten what I wanted - information - so I sat.

I looked in vain on the ground for any tracks and I noticed that the earth had been stirred up a little nearby, apparently from where the object had come down. There was a little small mound of dirt in the middle of the disturbance in the soil.

I don't know how long I sat there, but after a while I decided to leave and get out of the area. I didn't want this thing to come back and land on me or anything like that. As I started to leave, I noticed a small lizard or salamander-like creature about 10 or 12 inches long crossing the dirt path in front of me. As I watched, it disappeared into some bushes nearby. I felt that this creature was somehow connected with the object that I had seen, but I can't say for sure.

As I left the area and started walking back home, I was very shaken up by the whole experience and I kept looking over my shoulder, afraid the object might come back. However, I saw nothing further. When I got home I immediately told my wife what had happened, and she was as shaken up about it as I was.
