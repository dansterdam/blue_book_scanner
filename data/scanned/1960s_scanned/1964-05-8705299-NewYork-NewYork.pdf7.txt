The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of UFOs. The document appears to be a letter dated June 11, 1964, addressed to "Mr. [redacted]" and signed by "MSTON M. JACK, Major, USAF, Public Information Division, Office of Information."

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr. [redacted],

General Lamley has asked me to reply to your letter of June 8, 1964, which you enclosed a report by an unusual aerial object which was observed by personnel of the Manhattan Construction Company at approximately 8:50 p.m. on the evening of the 17th, one at 9:10 p.m. north of their construction site at 193rd Street and Broadway, New York City, on the evening of June 17, 1964.

I echo that I was responsible for this observation. It was the later sighting at approximately 9:10 p.m. which made light of two hazes over New York City. The object was described as being at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet, and was observed from one point since it was at the zenith and viewing it from the ground made it appear to stop altogether. It then began its swing downward, and it did not stop altogether until it began its swing downward.

Sincerely,
MSTON M. JACK
Major, USAF
