"It was about 2:45 a.m. or 3:00 a.m. when I first saw it. I was driving along the road into Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, at the time. It seemed to be about 60 feet up in the air and hovering. At first I thought it was just a bright star, but as I watched it, it seemed to be getting bigger and brighter and changing shape, almost as if it were pulsating. I stopped my car to get a better look at it. As I stood there watching, the object suddenly went straight up in the air at a great rate of speed and disappeared from sight. What I saw was a bright light, almost blinding in its intensity. It did not make a sound and was definitely no airplane or any other craft that I have ever seen. I am at a loss to explain what it was that I saw. It was very unusual and I was quite frightened. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this, even though I am out on the road at night quite often. I have no idea what it could have been, but I know it was not an airplane or any type of conventional aircraft that I am familiar with. It certainly was not a helicopter or weather balloon or anything of that nature. It was simply a bright light that hovered, changed shape, and then shot straight up into the air and disappeared completely. I am quite certain that it was not an optical illusion or my imagination. I have reported this incident to the proper authorities and hope that they may be able to shed some light on what I saw."
