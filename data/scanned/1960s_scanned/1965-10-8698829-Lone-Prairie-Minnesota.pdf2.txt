WEIRD SIGHTING OF SIX-INCH-TALL CREATURES IN MINNESOTA: At about 7:30 P.M. on October 12, 1965, a man driving along a country road near his home in Lone Prairie, Minnesota, witnessed a close encounter with six-inch-tall humanoid creatures. The witness reported that the creatures emerged from the side of the road and appeared to be studying an automobile that was parked nearby. The creatures were described as being about six inches tall, and the witness stated that they did not have eyes, but appeared to be scanning the area. After a brief sighting, the creatures reportedly reentered the side of the road and disappeared. The case was investigated by Jim Townsend, a local radio announcer, who interviewed the witness and documented the incident.
