The shared image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

Have you ever spent any time in the Northwest in Canada?
Not much.
Not much. Well, I talked to____ and several others,____who used to be at the U. of Missouri, he is now at Berkeley (and I know that's a bad name in colleges, but really it's quite good as far as intellectual) and Einstein was one of his teachers at Princeton quite a few years ago ____-- and I talked to him about it, and he seems to think from he's read and things that have come up as far as - he's just using what you'd call scientific' intuition which scientists don't like to use but in cases like this it's all they've got, and he seems to think that the Air Force is behind it in some way or another. If not behind it, they know more about it than they're letting on like they do, and I think that the man may have a point.- The reason I think that he does is because that there are too many ridiculous situations given, that just couldn't be. For instance, this weather balloon thing, with me. Now I know, sir, and of course you don't because you didn't see it, but I know positively now since they said that to me that they're full of hot air themselves. You see.
Yes.
And through the basic concepts of algebraic logic or any other kind of logic I can figure out, OK, there's something rotten in Denmark here.
Yes, one could arrive at that. We could have a long discussion on this, and I hope we do over a drink some time rather than over a long distance phone, but there, one could explain this also by complete military dumbness, and the military mind. There is that possible explanation.
