REPORT - TECHNICAL CENTER
Arm AFCIN-4Xb
ATTENTION AIR FORCE CASE 8228

Dear Sir:

On 7 May 19G1, there appeared a large triangular-shaped object over Sewart Air Force Base near Nashville, Tennessee. This object was observed by several pilots and control tower officials. They said there was no record of anything like this object being over the base at that time.

Some of the pilots said that when they looked at the object, it looked like it was about one mile in diameter and they said it had lights around the outside edge and that it appeared to be hovering over the area. They also said it made no sound and was at an altitude of around 47,000 feet.

The object disappeared from view and the pilots said that the object was at 50,000 - one military officer said that he did not know what the object was. Evidently this object did not belong to the U.S. Could it have been an unidentified flying object? This occurrence took place at 4:40 p.m. and 5:20 p.m. on 7 May 1961. The object was over Memphis, Tennessee at 4:40 p.m. and Nashville at 5:20 p.m.

Will you please give me the explanation? I anxiously await your reply.

Yours truly,
[Redacted]
