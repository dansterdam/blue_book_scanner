Text extracted from the document:

I feel that he is telling me to go back, to get out.
information for my observation of what I saw.
I was looking out the window and I saw what appeared to me to be a large silver balloon or some object.
It appeared to be moving on a east-west heading and the rate of speed was slow but I may estimate it to be about 200 mph.
Sometime there was a dark halo or shadow around the object and from here it had the shape of a normal balloon.
As the object became smaller in the distance I lost sight of it after about 5 minutes of observation.
Thank you.
