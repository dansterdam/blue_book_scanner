The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an object above it that appears to be a UFO or unidentified flying object. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine the object's height above the horizon. The second sketch shows a larger landscape view, with a person standing on a road and two smaller inset sketches showing different landscape perspectives.

OCRED TEXT:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.
33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was at when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when it disappeared. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
