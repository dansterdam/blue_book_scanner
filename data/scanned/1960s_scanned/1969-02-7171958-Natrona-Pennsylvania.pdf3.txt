The image contains two sketches. The larger one appears to be a compass rose or wind diagram, with directional labels around the perimeter. The smaller sketches depict two landscape scenes - one shows a silhouetted figure standing in a landscape, and the other shows a more detailed landscape with hills or mountains in the background.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"A. HOW IS AGAINST YOUR FACE, OR SKETCH OF THE COMPLETE REPORT FROM 3 TO 6 INCHES; PLACE ALL AS AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE. ASSUME THAT THE ORIGINAL WOULD BE ABOUT AS LARGE AS THE COPY SHOWN HERE.

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU SKETCH THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X OR THE POSTION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND ARROW TO SHOW HOW IT MOVED. IF IT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
