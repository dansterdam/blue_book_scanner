On the day of December third met for the first time the same U.F.O. It was almost evening from 4:12 
to 5:05 P.M. We saw it plain in the sky hovering over us and not unlike what I have seen be-
fore on TV. We were impressed and when we kept close watch on it, it seemed to disappear and 
reappear at intervals in slightly different positions. At times it seemed to be stationary and at
other times seemed to move a little at a time. We were greatly impressed and tried to tell
everyone we could about this strange phenomenon. This is the first time I have ever had an 
experience of this kind.
