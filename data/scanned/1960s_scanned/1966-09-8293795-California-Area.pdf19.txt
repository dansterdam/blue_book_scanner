"April 7, 1966"

Until on March 30, at 5:20 a.m. a witness observed what appeared to be a light in the sky. He noticed it was moving in a certain area about 50 yards away. The object suddenly slowed and then moved away at great speed, it seemed to accelerate rapidly and suddenly took off, I looked and watched the object because it was just 5:20 a.m. Then looked around the sky for other stars, the object finally disappeared, Then when I looked at it again it had moved closer to about 200 yards away, and then it slowly faded out of sight. This happened until the object was completely gone. These are the words of (Mrs.) the witness."
