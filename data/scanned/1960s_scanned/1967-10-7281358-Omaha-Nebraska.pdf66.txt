MEMORANDUM
16 Oct 67

I. SUBJECT: Just returned from a quick trip to Portland. See this UFO same old thing. It is still going on. I even read an article in a Sunday magazine in London---- that is the Truth about UFO'S--!

Everything I have noticed on everything I find on the subject. Suggest, however, that we should share the "double-header" that appeared in the paper to the left on my door. I know each do..

P.S. to all....SINCERELY
