Dear Colonel Manatt:

This is in response to your letter of June 30, 1967, concerning the reported observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) near Paris, Texas.

We have contacted our radar facility at Denison, Texas, concerning this matter and they advised that the UFO report was forwarded to them by a resident of Paris, Texas. No radar sightings were made.

We regret that we have no further information concerning this incident.

Sincerely yours,

B. W. BARTRON
