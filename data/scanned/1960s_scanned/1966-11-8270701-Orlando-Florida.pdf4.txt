the object was,as we came up on the overhead,beenrise up on the glass-covered-part of the green-lighted gas-station-be sign. in front of us lit up like a full moon and most of the lights seem to come from the rear and most of the other lights seemed to come from the rear and rest appeared to come from the front. it was brighter than any headlights and was hovering above the road about 30 to 40 feet at an altitude of about 100 feet. it appeared to have some kind of dome or something on top of it as it was lighted all around. there was no sound whatever. it hovered there for a minute or so. the object moved very slowly and silently. then it was just a little larger than a basketball. it returned to its original position and then made a very very quick movement and shot straight up and disappeared. it was brighter than any car headlights and most of the lights seemed to come from the rear and rest appeared to come from the front. it was very brightly lighted all around and that is what confuses and bewildered me. they told us a power failure report. it was no airplane, no balloon, no helicopter, nor plane. it is something which I have never seen and I have watched rockets cover up some. explanation of observation would like to learn at. if don't know, say so.

A statement can be obtained from Mrs. [redacted] if you care.

I would like a reply if it is at all possible.

I swear this statement is the truth and that I am not on city or service. the object was clearly visible and the altitude and movements. appears to be unlike anything being done now. 

Yours truly,
Mrs. [redacted]
