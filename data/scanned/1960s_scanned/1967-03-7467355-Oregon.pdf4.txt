The image contains a form with questions related to a UFO sighting, but there is no photograph present. I will now proceed to transcribe the text found in the document:

AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE HORIZON.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): (Yes) No Don't Know.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound NO SOUNDS WERE HEARD AT ANY TIME DURING THE SIGHTING
b. Color THESE LIGHT RED BLUE AND GREEN LIGHTS

18. We wish to know the apparent angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment of the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
ABOUT 1/10th of the object

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
