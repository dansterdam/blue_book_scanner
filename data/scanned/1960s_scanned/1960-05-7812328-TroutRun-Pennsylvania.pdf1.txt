10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Two objects - one round and one shaped like a boomerang. The round one was silhouetted against the sky, white. Remained in the west maneuvering for 4 1/2 hours. Objects appeared as lights, they followed a steady pattern for four and 1/2 hours, viewed from metal witness.

Since this is a one witness case it is classified as insufficient data. However, it is quite probable that the witness observed a light reflection from some stationary source.
