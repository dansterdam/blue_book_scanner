27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline). Indicate where you first saw the object. Draw a line to show how high the object was at the most. Draw a "B" on the same curved line to show the lowest point where you last saw the object.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object took. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
