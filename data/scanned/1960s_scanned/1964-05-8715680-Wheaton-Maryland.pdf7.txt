Text from the document:

"Hollooman Air Force Base, New Mexico.
May 27, 1964. The Hollooman Air Force confirmed that they have made radar contacts with unidentified objects in the area of White Sands, which lies east of Hollooman.
As an Air Force scientific installations, Hollooman has been concerned with the natural phenomenon, such as a dust storm, is the probable cause. However, it is conceivable that the presence in a dust storm could have induced radar return that resembled a solid object."
