35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire as a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The object I saw was a Circular shape object silver in color, about the size of a small automobile. It had a distinct outline, not hazy or blurred. It moved at a very rapid pace and high altitude. It was seen by my wife and myself while driving along the Southern State Parkway near Westbury, New York. The object appeared suddenly and disappeared from view in a matter of seconds. There were no flashing lights or sounds associated with the object. It seemed to travel with no apparent effort or power source. We were both amazed at what we saw and could not explain it as any conventional aircraft. The sighting lasted less than a minute.
