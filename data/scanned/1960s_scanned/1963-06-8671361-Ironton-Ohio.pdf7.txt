The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with handwritten text.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path of the object, or "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? 

22. We wish to know the smaller size. Hold a match stick or pencil in line with your eyes, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In the interest of science, we would like you to compare the object or objects which you saw, with any common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as that which you saw.
