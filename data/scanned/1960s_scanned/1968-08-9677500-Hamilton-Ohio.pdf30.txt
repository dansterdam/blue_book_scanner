REPORT OF BARNSTABLE MASS - SIGHTING OF JULY 29, 1968

On July 29, 1968, at approximately 12:30 AM, a house in Harthmouth at approximately 12:30 AM, a witness was driving north on IRS 25, at a point a few miles north of Harthmouth, Mass., when he
observed an unusual light in the sky to the east approximately 2 miles from his position. He slowed down his vehicle to observe the light. The light appeared to be large and disc-shaped. There were several smaller lights in front of them. They had the impression that it came down a few miles and then disappeared from sight. The witness was unable to give any estimate of the size or distance of the object, since there are no familiar objects or meters with which to compare. Since there are meters of considerable brightness that they said would be attributable to a meteor, except that they did not behave as shooting stars this should be considered an unknown. They had both decided they had seen a meteor, and continued along their way.

Checking with the Barnstable Police disclosed nothing unusual on the police blotter.

The enclosed clipping seems to be a mistaken identification, as the report in no way corresponds to have any connection with this sighting.
