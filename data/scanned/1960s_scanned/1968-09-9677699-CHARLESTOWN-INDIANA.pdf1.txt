COMMENTS: The observer wrote that "We have seen lights like stars, but not like stars before. They are brighter than stars, appear to move and random in different directions, but stay fairly close to one another, family uncles have been seeing lights around their farms. Since all the sightings seem of point lights, sources they is little chance of identifying the stimulis... Some may be caused by hot air balloons, asteroids, satellites, and stars and planets. Also since the sightings occurred at night, light sources they do not meet the defined definition of a UFO."
