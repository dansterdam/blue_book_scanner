The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text discussing the concept of a "supercosmic Disneyland" and the potential implications of such a model for understanding the Earth's invisibility even under microscopic observation. The text also mentions the reluctance of some scientists to accept evidence of intelligent beings existing elsewhere, and cautions against trying to communicate with them directly. Towards the end, it refers to slides depicting objects in the solar system, the Milky Way, and clusters of galaxies.

The full text of the document is as follows:

full play and assume that we could use the entire area
of the United States on which to construct our model--
a sort of supercosmic Disneyland. If we did this we
should discover to our amazement that even in such a
stupendous model the earth would be completely invisible,
even through a microscope. Yes, indeed, even through an
electron microscope. Faced with such a universe in which
to live, it is no wonder that man as a sub submicroscopic
speck feels isolated and alone, and afraid of the Russians,
and perhaps it is understandable that he might be desirous
of seeking out and finding some understanding intelligence
elsewhere. Indeed, there are few scientists, and particularly astronomers, who would not welcome bona fide evidence
that intelligent beings did exist elsewhere and that there was
a possibility of communication with them. (Think of the
increased appropriations for scientists--and for UFO investigators!) Only our military friends, justly cautious,
warn us, if this be the case, not to try to communicate
first, lest our "friends" in space prove hostile and
annihilate or at least exploit us. Perhaps we should be
content to be alone in space!
(At this point in the talk a number of representative
slides were shown depicting objects in the solar system, in
our galaxy, The Milky Way, and clusters of galaxies out to
the limit of the visible universe.)
