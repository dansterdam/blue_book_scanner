The image contains two photographs. The top photograph appears to be an aerial view or photograph of some terrain, possibly a landscape. The image is grainy and black and white, making it difficult to discern many details. The bottom photograph is also a black and white image, but it is even more difficult to make out any distinct details due to the lower quality of the image.
