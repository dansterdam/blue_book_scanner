THE INTERVIEW - Street
Mr. and Mrs. were awakened about 1:00 A.M. on June 26, 1963 by an "um-godly sound - like a slow moving jet" - in the heat they could describe it. Their bed was pulled up to the back window so as to keep cool. Their heads were near the window and they both looked out. Mrs. observed the UFO and was terrified, jumping under the covers. Mr. observed the object for approximately one minute. He said, was like "two hamburger buns one on top of another with a sandwiched piece of meat protruding around." Its outline was seen because of two lights on the object; one on the top and one on the bottom which were shaped like "Turkish Fez hats". It hovered momentarily, slowly moved at a height of about 100 feet over trees about 300 feet away, crossed lower lines.
