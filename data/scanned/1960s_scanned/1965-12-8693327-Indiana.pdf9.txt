On the afternoon of December 9th, a mysterious firefall made its way across several states and Canada, and was sighted by airline pilots as well as by hundreds or thousands of other people. Strange metal strips were found in a swamp 40 miles northwest of Bristow, Oklahoma, about 30 miles from Pittsburg, Pa. It was sealed off for several hours - while a thorough search and hundreds of interviews of people were conducted.
The object made a tremendous noise and light as it passed, and was observed in several states. It is indicated that a meteorite was probably the cause of it all, but the times involved indicate that the object was traveling much too slow for a meteorite. There have been several references to such a firefall in the past, and the object has been compared to a "green fireball" seen in other parts of the country.
