Have a Hobby - Be Wealthy!
One of our finest wealths is to be wealthy in friends - a wealth of knowledge to be shared with each other. Understanding and patience and many other wealths.
Hobbies, strange collecting, cover collecting and many other hobbies gives us the worthwhile wealths of life - friendships, contentment. Indescribable pleasures.
In our town we see so called successful men, perhaps with plenty of worldly goods but they have never learned to get away from the routine of business, because they have missed the pleasures of a hobby.
All of a sudden they are retired - their old business associates and cronies give them dinner presents them with a plaque as a tribute of their affection - they wish them well.
All of once they are on their own - the golden years of retirement are here - with plenty of time and no way to use it - they have missed the boat, so to speak.
So I say "Have a Hobby! - Be Wealthy!"
