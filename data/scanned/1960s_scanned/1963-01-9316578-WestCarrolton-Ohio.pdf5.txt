The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing a series of questions for the witness.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? 
22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object. If you had performed this, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, went behind tower
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw.
