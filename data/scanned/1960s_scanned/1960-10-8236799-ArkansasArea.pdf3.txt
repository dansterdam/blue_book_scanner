Unidentified Object Sighted Over Miles City This Morning

By GEORGE LARSON
This morning, at approximately 5:00 a.m., Mrs. Erman Homan, who lives at the corner of Eighth and Park, spotted an unusual object in the sky over Miles City. She called her husband, who also observed the object.

Mr. and Mrs. Homan went on to describe the object as being oval-shaped, silver in color, and about the size of a car. It was moving rapidly across the sky from the northwest to the southeast. The Homans said the object appeared to be gliding rather than flying, and they could see no exhaust or propulsion system. 

They watched the object for about two minutes until it disappeared from view. Mrs. Homan said she managed to get a pair of binoculars and was able to see the object more clearly. She described it as definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known aircraft.

The Homans immediately called the Miles City Police Department to report the sighting. Patrolman Dave Kiley responded to the call and also observed the object briefly before it disappeared. He described it as a rapidly moving, silvery oval-shaped craft with no visible means of propulsion.

Several other residents of Miles City also reported seeing the unidentified object this morning, though none were able to observe it for as long as the Homans. The police department has filed a report on the incident and notified the proper authorities.

UFOs Sighted In City Area
In a continuing series of UFO sightings in this area, several residents of Miles City reported seeing strange objects in the sky over the city Thursday night and early Friday morning.

According to the reports, the objects, which were described as round, oval or disc-shaped, were observed maneuvering at high speeds and making 90-degree turns. The craft were said to be brightly lit and of various colors, including white, red and green.

One person who saw the objects said they appeared to hover silently for periods of time before speeding off at tremendous velocities. Another witness reported seeing three or four objects flying in a triangular formation.

The sightings were made between 8:30 p.m. Thursday and 1:30 a.m. Friday. The police department has filed reports on the incidents and notified the proper authorities.
