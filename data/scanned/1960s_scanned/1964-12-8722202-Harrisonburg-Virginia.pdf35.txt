Gentlemen:

I have a good friend at Eastern Mennonite College in Harrisonburg, Virginia, who is interested in U.F.O.'s. He told me that on December 21, 1964, as he was driving from his home in Broadway, Virginia, to Harrisonburg, he suddenly saw an object pass overhead and disappear very suddenly.  

As he drifted to a stop off the highway, a large flat bottomed, circular and domed object came over and hovered directly overhead at a distance of about 60 yards away. He estimated the object to be about 125 feet in diameter.

It had a glowing exhaust that followed the object as it moved away toward the mountain at a terrific speed. As it drove away very shaken up.

This is probably routine to you. The significant factor is that the object produced a counter from the Geiger counter he had with him. This showed intense radioactivity around it. No doubt the area is still radioactive to some extent.

But this should not be of some help to you.
