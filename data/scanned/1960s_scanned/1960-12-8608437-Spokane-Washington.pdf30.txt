DATE INVESTIGATED 23 Aug 1960
INVESTIGATOR Robert E Jones, Major, USAF
SUBJECT Unidentified Aerial Object Sighting
SYNOPSIS: Witness reported observing a bright light moving rapidly in the sky. Object appeared to be under intelligent control.

DETAILS: Mrs. John X Doe, 2301 NW Broadway, Spokane, Washington, reported that on the evening of 23 August 1960 at approximately 2100 hours, she observed a bright light moving rapidly in the western sky. The object appeared to be under intelligent control and made several abrupt changes in direction and speed. The object was visible for approximately 2 minutes before disappearing from view.

Mrs. Doe stated that the object appeared to be a single point of light, brighter than any star, and gave off an intense white light. She further stated that the object moved with a rapid, darting motion, making several sharp turns and stops during the sighting. Mrs. Doe reported the incident to the United States Air Force.

INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS: Based on the witness's description, this appears to have been a genuine sighting of an Unidentified Aerial Object. The rapid, darting motion and apparent intelligent control of the object are characteristic of many UFO sightings. Further investigation is warranted to determine the nature and origin of the object observed.

DISPOSITION: Case remains open and under investigation.
