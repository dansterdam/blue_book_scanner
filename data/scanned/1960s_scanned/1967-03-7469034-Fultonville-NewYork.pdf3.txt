DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 20330

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

MAY 29 1967

Dear Mr. _______,

This replies to your recent correspondence regarding your unidentified observation on March 30, 1967.

Detailed investigation revealed that you probably saw the chemical clouds produced by your complexion of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at approximately 7 p.m. EST, March 30, 1967, released from the WSMR atmosphere. This caused the clouds to become various colors, but eventually they burned blue in elongated patterns along the lines of the earth's magnetic field. The clouds may extend across the sky for several hundred miles and can be visible for thirty minutes to an hour.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

BARNETT B. YOUNG
Lt Colonel, USAF
Community Relations Division
Office of Information

Utica, New York 13503

What about that mysterious red ball that we saw on the N.Y. State Thruway and was even seen in Utica by a few observers? Please send reply. Thank you.
