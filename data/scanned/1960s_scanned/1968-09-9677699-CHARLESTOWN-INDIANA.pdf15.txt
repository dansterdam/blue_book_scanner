WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
We saw it like a star, but not like a star. They are brighter than stars. Its more like a star, near the moon, but there are changes from time to time like star in different directions or power installations. They move up, down, side to side faster than stars. I'm like a shooting star.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Was seen on horizon that it went below tree line or was to far to see anymore. They are hard to watch since they move from place to place.
