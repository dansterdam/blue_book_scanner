17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: 
a. Sound - I cannot remember any sound was made
b. Color - bright white
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
This is hard to determine now. It has been over a week since I saw them.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and specifically show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
