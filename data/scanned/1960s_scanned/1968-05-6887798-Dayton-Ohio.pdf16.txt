The image contains a form with a table, but no photograph is present. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

DID THE PHENOMENON
HAVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STANDS STILL AT ANYTIME?
SUDDENLY GOES UP AND RUN AWAY!
BREAK UP INTO PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE IN SHAPE?
CHANGE IN SPEED?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
MAKE A NOISE?
LEAVE ANY TRAIL?
WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

A. DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

B. WHAT PHENOMENON MOVE BEING ON 14 FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
