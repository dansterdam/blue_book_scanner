The image contains a sketch/diagram, but no photograph. The sketch shows an illustration with compass directions and instructions on how to depict the motion of an observed object or objects, including their direction and any changes in direction during the course of the observation.

Here is the text from the document, produced as an OCR output:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "Y" on the compass where you last saw it.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
