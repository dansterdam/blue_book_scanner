observe, had no fins, no rudder and no wing protrusion, no wing protrusion on this object at all. As the object was observed, it seemed to sway from one side to the other. This object went in a straight line until it neared the outer edges of the town, then it would suddenly make a right angle turn and fly off in another direction, Then it would repeat the same maneuver. This object was observed by many people and the town was in an uproar. It was remotely controlled, this I would not say, however, in my estimation of a remote control operated object, this shows a tendency to vary a little, and there was no variation to the right or variation to the left. This object seemed to be under a precise control. it made its turns at right angles without the slightest hesitation.
