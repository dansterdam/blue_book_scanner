Text from the document:

DATE - TIME GROUP: 25 June 67 23/0430Z
LOCATION: Saratoga, New York
SOURCE: Civilian
NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Several
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 40 to 50 Seconds
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
PHOTOS: Possible (AIRCRAFT) INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
CONCLUSIONS:
Observers sighted several bright red lights that went in a southeasterly direction. No noise was heard.
COMMENTS: There was a satellite decay on this date at 1200 hrs plus or minus 2 hours. It is possible this is the date. Much more likely is the possibility that an aircraft, a meteor or uncontrolled debris decayed on this date. The sighting stated that Saratoga Springs Radar station reported they had not tracked anything. The original traces were never found nor subsequently identified on other radar. The original traces were required with absolute clarity to enable any type of identification, but never received.
