The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a handwritten text describing a UFO sighting, but does not contain any photographs.

Transcribed text:
The objects approached over Fairview according to the observer very slowly and without noise. They hovered close enough to permit a good observation. Two elongated shaped objects, one about twice the size of the other, with a distinct oval shape. They appeared to be metallic and glowed with a reddish-orange color. There was no visible means of propulsion and no other unusual features were observed. The objects remained in the area for a few minutes and then rapidly ascended into the sky and disappeared.
