Here is the text from the document:

SUBJECT: UFO Sightings - Barnwell/Allendale, South Carolina, 18-23 NOV 1967
DATE: 10 December 1967
REFERENCE: In Person
SOURCE: James H. Sabol
CHAIRMAN: NICAP, Washington, D.C.
CASE INVESTIGATORS:
10 certify that on 18 November 1967 a report was made to the Sheriff's Office, Barnwell County, South Carolina, that an unidentified flying object had been observed. It was stated that the object had been hovering over a field for approximately 15 minutes and then suddenly accelerated and raced away at a high rate of speed. The report was made by Mr. James H. Sabol, a resident of Burnettown, South Carolina. 
Mr. Sabol stated on the evening of 18 November 1967 he was sitting on his porch in Burnettown when he observed a strange light in the sky. He stated the light appeared to be hovering over a field in the distance. He stated he watched the light for approximately 15 minutes and during this time it made several unusual maneuvers. He stated the light then suddenly accelerated and raced away at a high rate of speed.
EVALUATION:
There may have been a connection between the two young boys who may have observed the same or a similar object a few days prior to 18 November 1967. However, there is no evidence to substantiate this.
INTERVIEW:
10 object was found. The light could have been a normal aircraft or a reflection of some type. No investigation could be made with any degree of reliability on this case.
LOCKPORT: The U.S. Coast Guard Helicopter was seen by Mr. Jackson to be flying in that area about that time. This could account for the sighting.
CONCLUSION: Due to the lack of data (time-distance) and the generally lack of reliable information, this case must be classified as Insufficient Information for Evaluation.
