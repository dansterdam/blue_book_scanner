Dear Sir:
On August 7, 1966 at my home for a period of a bout 10 to 15 minutes, my brother and I saw a bright light in the sky. It appeared to be the same as the one a friend from the area had seen before. 
We saw it lower than the rest of the stars and it then seemed to vanish... It took this light 10 to 15 minutes to get too high to continue to see it. This is about all I can tell you and with assurance. Fwend 165.
