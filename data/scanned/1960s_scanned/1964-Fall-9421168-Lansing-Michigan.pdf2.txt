Transcribed text from the document:

Normally, after this moment of a sighting, the actual details are fairly well remembered, but to the best of this witness's recollection, the details of this sighting are rather vague. He recalls seeing a lighted object in the sky which appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed. The object seemed to be about the size of a car and had a pulsating, blinking light. It was white in color and appeared to be about 1500 feet in the air. The witness was unable to determine the exact distance or altitude of the object. He stated that it was visible for only about 10 to 15 seconds and then disappeared. The witness described the object as making a slight hum or whirring sound. He said that it did not seem to leave a trail or exhaust of any kind. According to the witness, the object appeared to be moving in a straight line. He said that he had no idea as to its nature or origin. The witness was somewhat puzzled by what he had seen and indicated that he had never seen anything like it before. It was his opinion that the object could not have been an aircraft, but he was unable to offer any other explanation for what he had observed. The witness seemed to be a reliable individual and his report appeared to be given in good faith. It was the opinion of the investigator that the witness had indeed seen an unidentified flying object.
