ATTN OF: TA-3

SUBJECT: UFO's

TO:  ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. There have been sightings of UFO's in the vicinity of Sheppard AFB. These sightings took place on 13, 14 and 15 January. Not all of these sightings were related.

2. The sightings of 13 January were made by personnel from the 3615th Support Squadron. On one occasion they observed an object over Altus AFB, Oklahoma, which appeared to be highly maneuverable. Major Aiken has had much experience in these investigations and does not consider this sighting to be highly reliable. 

3. Reference my message of 13 January TA17022A concerning 10 January sightings. The ground sighted object described was said to have been extremely bright. It is not described in the reports and Mr. described it as highly maneuverable with the aircraft (see Atch #2 and #3); but, since these reports were received too late to be included, the conclusions based on the observation are considered questionable. The testimony obtained from the description and path of the object is being re-evaluated.

4. The 11 January sighting was reported by Mrs.   whose judgement and reliability seem questionable. It is significant that this occurrence took place on the same day that the object (see Atch #3) and she described it as "clear as crystal" which is highly questionable. Further, no other persons reported seeing the object, which seems unlikely if it were an actual observation. This tends to conclude that the object was an illusion, or that Mrs.  was possibly mistaken.

5. Mr.  reported that he saw an extremely bright object in the southwest sky to the west as he drove from Hobart, Oklahoma to Presidenent, Oklahoma (see Atch #4). This is being evaluated.
