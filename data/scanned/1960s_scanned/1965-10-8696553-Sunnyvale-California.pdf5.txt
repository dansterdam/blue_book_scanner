SAUCER LANDING IN CONNECTICUT: Just before press time, we learned of an sensational incident that occurred on the nights of October 2nd, 1958 and 3rd, in Southington, Connecticut. According to police lieutenant Ruben Taylor, a UFO landed and a man emerged from it. The craft was only 50 feet above the ground and 30 feet in diameter. He described it as being 24 car lengths in diameter, and 33 lengths high. It had a corrugated bottom, and numerous lights including four "portholes" type lights on the side. After several seconds it ascended to a high hill several hundred yards distant, and on several occasions it swooped down again to various parts of the countryside. Policeman Taylor was a skeptic until he saw it himself. Southington police chief confirmed the sighting, but it shows only a white speck at some distance from the camera, against the night sky.
