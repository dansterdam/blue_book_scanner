The text in the document reads:

AN OBSERVER LOCATED APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILES SOUTH OF KANAWHA COUNTY AIRPORT SIGHTED AN OBJECT AT 13:14.25 HIGH OVERHEAD FLYING IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION. AT 13:32.32 THE OBJECT BURST, LAUNCHING A 133 GRAM WEATHER BALLOON FROM KANAWHA COUNTY AIRPORT. THE BALLOON WAS UNDER OBSERVATION FOR TWENTY-SEVEN MINUTES DURING WHICH TIME IT ROSE TO RELATIVELY LOW POUNDS ALMOST IT REMAINED OVERHEAD IN THE IMMEDIATE CHARLESTON VICINITY FOR QUITE SOME TIME. IT REACHED A MAXIMUM ALTITUDE OF 23,300 FT. WINDS ALOFT FORECASTS FROM 29,000 FT. WERE WOULD INDICATE THE BALLOON ON A SOUTH-EASTERLY COURSE. THE ALTITUDE AND OVERHEAD POSITION OF THE BALLOON WOULD MAKE IT HARD FOR THE OBSERVER TO DETERMINE ITS ACTUAL COURSE. DUE TO THE REPORTED DESCRIPTION AND U.X BUREAU INFORMATION I ASSUME THAT THE WEATHER BALLOON WAS A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE SIGHTING.
