The shape of the object was, from my estimation, round, and of a silvery metallic color. It appeared to be hovering or stationary in the sky.
From the front it appeared to have a bright light, as if a headlight was on the front. The size of the object appeared to be about 15-20 feet in diameter.
The object did not make any sound that I could hear, and maintained its position in the sky for several minutes before slowly drifting away behind some trees, at which point I lost sight of it.
