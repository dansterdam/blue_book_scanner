The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a technical drawing or diagram related to a UFO sighting. The drawing appears to be an instructional guide or worksheet, with numbered sections providing instructions on how to describe and draw the motion and position of a sighted object.

Transcribing the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass rose to show the direction from where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" for the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
