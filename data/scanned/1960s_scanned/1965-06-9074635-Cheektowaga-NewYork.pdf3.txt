Gentlemen:

As I have read many books about flying saucers, I came across the book, "Flying Saucers and the U.S. Air Force," by L. J. Lorenzen.  In it you requested that anyone with any information to please write in, so I decided I would.

On Thursday, June 10, 1965, I spotted a flying object that I would consider a flying saucer. It was somewhat V shaped, left no vapor trail, and it was white in color with a blinking effect.

I hope this information will be of some use to you.

I would also appreciate it very much if you could send me any more information on flying saucers. I would appreciate a reply very much.

Sincerely yours,
FRASER
