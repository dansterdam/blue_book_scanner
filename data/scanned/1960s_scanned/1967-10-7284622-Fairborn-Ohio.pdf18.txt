The image contains a sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch appears to be an illustration for a UFO sighting report, with instructions on how to draw the motion of the observed object and indicate its location relative to the compass.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the sketch at the high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a sketch of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
