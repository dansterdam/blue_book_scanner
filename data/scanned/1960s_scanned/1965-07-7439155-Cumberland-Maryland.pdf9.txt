Gentlemen:

I think these two photos of an UFO will be of interest since the report went through your facilities. It was taken at Martinsburg on July 25th from 5:01 PM.

Both photos are over-exposed through my own fault. The object was taken at 5:25; the number on the seconds counter on my camera was 26 (deducted guessing). The UFO appears as a thin, jerky line.

In photo one, the line seems to separate. This was caused by the fluctuating brilliance of the object (there were no clouds in that portion of the sky), which brightened and dimmed at regular intervals.

In photo number 2, the UFO appears as a barely visible object at the bottom center of the picture. The object was out of sight, below the trees.

Immediately after finishing the second photo, I contacted Martinsburg Police. You had no information to indicate that any objects, aircraft, or otherwise, that fit my description of the case.

I want to thank you for the excellent cooperation you in filing the reports with the proper authorities. You may keep the photos if you wish.

Very truly yours,
