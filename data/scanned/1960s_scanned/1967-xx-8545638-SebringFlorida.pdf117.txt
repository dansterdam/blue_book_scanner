N. Woodstock Woman Avows
UFO Froze 2 Refrigerators
NORTH WOODSTOCK - Mrs. 
Pauline Rowe said today that a 
gigantic UFO that hovered over 
her garage last Friday night 
shaped "like a huge lozenge" 
froze the contents of two refrig-
erators in her home. 
"The strange thing was made Fri-
day night about 9:45," said Mrs. 
Rowe. "My son, William, 14, and 
I were standing outside the garage
looking up when we saw the 
strange craft."
"It was a huge lozenge-shaped ob-
ject and it seemed to be made of 
metal. It hovered over the garage 
at a height of about 50 ft. for about 
10 minutes. Then it moved up and 
down and back and forth. We 
could see the bright lights from 
the craft. Then it seemed to just
disappear."

Mrs. Rowe said that the camera
she was using is a good one, but 
the lights on the craft were so 
bright the craft could hardly be 
seen in the pictures.
"It wasn't until later that night 
that we found the contents of two 
refrigerators in my kitchen were 
frozen solid," Mrs. Rowe said. 
"The things in the freezer compart-
ments were frozen, but not quite the
same."
The housewife said that the solid
freezing of the contents of the two 
refrigerators was not due to a power 
failure, as there was no interruption
in the electricity. "I'd say - although 
it's hard to determine -  that the 
UFO had something to do with 
it," she added.
Her son, William, a sophomore at 
Northampton High School, said he 
also saw the strange craft. "It was 
a huge lozenge-shaped thing and 
it seemed to be made of metal. 
When it hovered over the garage 
it looked like something from an-
other world," the youth said.
