DAVIDSVILLE, MARYLAND 11365
REPORT SUBMITTED BY: JOE SMITH 
OCCUPATION: FARMER
DATE OF SIGHTING: 2-6-1967
TIME OF SIGHTING: APPROXIMATELY 8:45 PM
WEATHER CONDITIONS: CLEAR, COOL, WIND SSW 10 MPH
DURATION OF SIGHTING: APPROX. 5 MINUTES
DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
AT APPROXIMATELY 8:45 PM ON 2-6-1967, I WAS STANDING OUTSIDE MY BARN LOOKING UP AT THE CLEAR NIGHT SKY WHEN I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE NORTHWEST. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE MOVING SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION. I WATCHED IT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AS IT CONTINUED ITS COURSE. SUDDENLY, THE LIGHT STOPPED AND HOVERED FOR ABOUT A MINUTE. IT THEN SHOT STRAIGHT UP AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.

I IMMEDIATELY WENT INSIDE AND CALLED THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT WHAT I HAD SEEN. THEY DISPATCHED AN OFFICER TO MY FARM, AND HE ALSO OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE IT VANISHED. PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN, BUT THEY DID NOT TURN OUT VERY CLEAR DUE TO THE POOR LIGHTING CONDITIONS.

I AM A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF THIS AREA AND HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. IT WAS A VERY STRANGE AND UNNERVING EXPERIENCE. I HOPE THAT SOMEONE CAN PROVIDE SOME EXPLANATION FOR WHAT I WITNESSED THAT NIGHT.
