The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page of text from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

The text of the document is as follows:

The object, whatever it was, didn't stop at all. It went at tremendous speed, about 4-500 mph and then down a very fast and steep angle, and then hovered again. It started from an angle, it came very slowly, it started down at an angle, and the witness saw it with curiosity and I leaped back into the car and followed it. I went along to decide it myself to the Lansing Hospital Association. I was all flabbergasted about it, surprised, dumbounded. As matter of fact, I couldn't continue to follow the object as it again disappeared later on. 

I aimed about 2 miles behind the hospital, near the sewer (culvert). I went there to be a little careful to make sure I was not confused. But there was nothing. I thought about how ridiculous it could sound as I did see it. That's just the impact of what I saw. It was almost like it was playing hide and seek with us.

I might add that it fell it was a blinking white light. When it stopped it seemed to change for a sizable amount to be a greenish and blue-green. I could not see any definite lights on it.

I at 11:45 PM Central time about 4 1/2 but the object could have been there for some time before. Now it just seems strange to you. I doubt if it was a better considering where it came from and I never heard of anything strange to that matter. I definitely want to remark that if it was something you people have ever consider on earth, if it was something you people have ever consider on earth, with propels nor. I very definitely do not believe in flying saucers and such but it has occurred me a little eerie.
