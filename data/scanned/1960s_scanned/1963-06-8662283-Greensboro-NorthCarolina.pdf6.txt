TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

5. an aircraft appearing at about 5:45 p.m. on 8 June 1963 was observed by a number of people in Greensboro, North Carolina, USA. It was described as being saucer-shaped, metallic in appearance, and brightly lit to apparently light up everything under it. It was reported that the crossing speed of an aircraft-like object was estimated at approximately 30,000 feet per minute without any perceptible movement or difficulty of operation.

6. Object could have been at any altitude and any size as there was no basis for comparison.

7. Speed seemed to increase after that five minutes of observation and it disappeared in a manner that a conventional aircraft could not be observed in confirmation.

8. Recendently seemed to be lack of a complaint speed and a somewhat erratic motion as though it made sudden movements instead of gradual movements, in a manner a conventional aircraft would probably not move.
