There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document with text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

There are other people that work with me. When I went to take the car to the shop, Joe said he would go with me. It was a pretty sunny day and there were quite a few people out on the street. 

I would say that the object seemed to be fairly close, maybe 5 or 6 blocks away. I know it was not an airplane or helicopter, but I can't say for certain what it was. The object appeared to be oval-shaped and was moving at a fairly slow speed, maybe 100 mph or less. It seemed to be about the size of a car, but I'm not sure.

I hope this helps provide the information you were looking for. Let me know if you have any other questions.
