Alaska Air Command Probes Reports of Silver Object in Sky
ANCHORAGE, Alaska Feb. -The Alaska Air Command at Nome was investigating a flashing, silvery object in western Alaska skies the last two nights. 
Major Roy E. Haines, public information officer at Ladd Air Force Base here, said tonight:
"We have the report and are investigating it. Some people said it looked like a jet plane with flames shooting from the tail."
The Alaska Air Command probed the reports with several persons from Nome and St. Michael about 175 miles across western Alaska.
"It appeared from the direction of Russian Siberia and flashed southeasterly," Haines said.
The reports were conflicting. Some said it appeared to be a jet-propelled object while others described it as a flying saucer-shaped object.
Haines said an investigation was started immediately. He said radar records of the stations north of Nome were to be checked to determine if any planes were in the area at the time.
