The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document on a typed form. The text in the document is as follows:

What it was not. (May, if any.)

We -no pictures could be seen with the naked eye. These (may) have been hidden by a haze or low hanging clouds as coming in on a slant, may have been sighted but 1/2 size.

Large balloon - these objects lower in vertical spin.

Small objects - much too large for planets. I saw them clearly. Distance unknown but far.

Star in moon - Much too large for planet tonight. Object did not move steady direction as they were glowing with a faint minute behind clouds, say was at.
