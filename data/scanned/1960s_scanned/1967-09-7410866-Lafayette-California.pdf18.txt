14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

I could tell it was an ordinary light.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
At first 3 minutes or so it was still on top movements. The last minute or 2 it seemed to slowly move off the ground and disappear into the distance. I became somewhat concerned in case it was reappearing elsewhere It seemed to move out and away at a constant rate.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
Yes, the phenomenon moved behind and in front of some houses and trees up to its disappearance into the distance.
