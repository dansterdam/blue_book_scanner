Personal Comments
Mrs. * is 71 years old, appears to live alone, and she states the impraised speed of an "insect-sized person". I became aware of no reason to doubt her word of this matter. Her previous dealings with the object of lighting or rotating curiosity. She had volunteered no ideas on the origin of UFO's in general or the cause of the sighting she witnessed.
Unfortunately, too, the fortune to know anything about the individual who made this statement. From the contents, it would appear likely he or she was probably on the scene or hearing of the incident in some direct way prior to the report transmission. The person(s) observing this phenomenon do not seem to indicate a reason to doubt the testimony and are familiar with UFO incidents which the report often listens to.
Concerning the possibility of a natural explanation, the moon does not appear to be a candidate. According to reasonable assumptions, the moon would be rising in the east about 1:30 AM on October 7, 1968, and the moon would be visible in the east slight light dawn and appearing like a small silver.
