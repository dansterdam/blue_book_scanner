On the night of November 1, 1961 at approximately 8 P.M. CST at my home in Diboll, Texas, I received a telephone call from a neighbor who observed a small lighted object in the sky. I went out to see the object, which appeared to me to be something like a satellite, but a flashing light on the object caught my attention. The object appeared to me to be the same as I had previously observed Echo on several occasions. The object suddenly disappeared after observing it several minutes. It did not observe any aircraft, though as the night was clear and numerous stars were in the sky, it was brighter than the stars. I did not observe any other lights, though as the observer stated the object was seen in connection with high flying aircraft.
