The following is a summary of a statement by Mr. [Redacted], Indianapolis, Indiana, describing a reported flying object:

"This happened about 3:35 in the morning of 23 March. I was awakened with a sound through my bedroom wind ow. I looked out and saw this thing out of my window. It would have been in the direction of northeast. It seemed to be up in the air and hovering. It would stay there like a cloud. A light would blink on and off. It was approximately the size of a star, a brilliant size. It looked like a lot of things mangled together. It would go up and down. There were no clouds, clear sky. It hovered there for a while and then suddenly it seemed to go off like a shot. There was no sound. It was a distance away about a mile or like, the way it happened it would just go off like a shot. The following is a summary of a statement by Mr. [Redacted]: I have been quite a pessimist until I saw this. Description of object: It looked like a baseball, it was about the size of a baseball. It looked like it had hairs instead of being solid. It was quite a distance away, the color was about the color of the star. The thing that impressed me was the way it would stay stationary and then just take off. No sound at all. Description of course: As I looked out the window, the object was about 500 yards above the ground. A matter of only a few seconds, Who called your attention to this? No one, I happened to wake up and I saw it thro ugh my bedroom window. He stated that it lasted about 30 seconds that he ob served it and suddenly stopped. It dis appeared. It just blanked out.
