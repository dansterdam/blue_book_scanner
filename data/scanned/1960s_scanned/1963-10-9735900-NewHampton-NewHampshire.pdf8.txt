February 12, 1964

Dear [redacted],

The Air Force has attempted an evaluation of the incident described in your letter of October 24, 1963, which was recently forwarded to this Headquarters.

Letter and the form 941 enclosed with your letter indicate that on your flight on July 8, 1963, at about 10:25 p.m., you sighted a strange light in the sky. This light, in your letter, you indicate appeared slower than a jet and was triangular in shape and blue-green in color. The distance traveled was less than 150 yards in approximately 2 to 3 minutes.

After a careful evaluation of the information you provided, I am unable to support your contention that the incident was of an extraterrestrial nature. Conflicting data and carries this evaluation.

On the assumption that the information supplied in your letter and the reported time and location are accurate, I am unable to explain satisfactorily the sighting you witnessed. However, it is my opinion that the sighting was probably a natural phenomenon and does not represent evidence of visitation of our airspace by extraterrestrial vehicles.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. I trust my explanation and conclusion conform with your expectations.

Sincerely,

[Redacted]
Project Officer
