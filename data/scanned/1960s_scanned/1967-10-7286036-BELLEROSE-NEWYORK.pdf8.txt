1. Reference your undated letter regarding the evaluation on your unidentified aerial observation of October 22, 1967.
2. You may be interested in the enclosed information on aerial advertising. The maga zine "Sandy Claaorna," April 9, 1967 issue, and the letter from Luverne, Illinois, illustrate how electrical advertising can be mistinterpreted as unidentified flying objects. I hope this additional information will answer any questions you had on your observation.
