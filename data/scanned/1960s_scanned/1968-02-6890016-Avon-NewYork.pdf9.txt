There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. The image shows a typed document with text that I will proceed to extract and output.

EEPORT (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/79216/21 May 68
UFO Reports, Mr. Frank M. Quinlan

64th Tactical Airlift Wing
Attn: COIN/1st Lt Signalgo

1. Reference your undated letter in which you forwarded unidentified flying object (UFO) reports of 30 July 1967, 12 January 1968 and 21 February 1968 by (name redacted).

2. None of these reports were submitted in accordance with AFR 80-17 and change notices. We will accept this report but will return any future reports that are not properly investigated. Because of the number of UFOs that Mr. (name redacted) has forwarded, the reliability of any report made by him is questionable.

FOR THE COMMANDER:

VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR. Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
Assistant Director, Aerospace Technical Division
