18 February 1969

Mrs. 
Route 1
Cochrane, Wis. 54622

Dear Mrs. Lietzau:

In my capacity as scientific consultant to the U. S. Air Force on the matter of unidentified flying objects, I have had occasion to investigate a number of reports that have been submitted to your unit. In doing so, it has become apparent to me that certain aspects of the analysis and assessment that is possible regarding UFO reports can be somewhat confusing or at least not as definitive as possible in certain instances.

Although I have cleared up such details as the exact direction you were moving, the condition of the sky, and the color of the object or objects you saw, the more important factor, I would just like to talk with you to see what you now think of the incident, now that a year has passed. I am also interested in knowing how your account of the sighting was treated by your friends and acquaintances. It appears that in instances where sightings are published, there is often a negative reaction to consider.

I would like to place a call to you some evening during the week of February 24, preferably Wednesday the 26th, or Thursday the 27th. Would either of those dates be convenient for you? I would appreciate an envelope addressed to me to facilitate your reply.

I wish to assure you that no publicity or inconvenience will result from your talking with me since I have made it a practice over many years never to disclose the name of a person who makes a sighting without their specific permission. I hope, therefore, that you will cooperate with me in the interest of science and that any reluctance you may have in fighting with this project will continue to the eventual conclusion of this particular case.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
