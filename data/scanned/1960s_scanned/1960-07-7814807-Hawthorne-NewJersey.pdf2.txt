The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Dear Sir:

The document appears to be a letter describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. The letter mentions that the object was visible for approximately 25-30 seconds and was at an approximate altitude of 25,000 feet. The letter states that the object appeared to be moving at a very high speed and that it was witnessed by a number of people. The letter also mentions that the object was observed to suddenly increase in speed and disappear from view.

The letter is signed by an individual from Hawthorne, New Jersey.
