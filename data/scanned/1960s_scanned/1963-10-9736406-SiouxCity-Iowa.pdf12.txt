DEAR ALLEN,

THE CASE 1NVOLVING THE MEN WHO MADE TEN 33 LIGHTING OBSERVATIONS ON THE 33RD UET REPORTED IN THE FIRST UFO IUUNDCTICN, DATED 13 JAN 63, IS BEING REOPENED. INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AND MORE DETAILS OBTAINED. ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, WHEN HE TRIED TO REPORT THE SIGHTIRGS AT NEARBY POLICE STATIONS THEY REFUSED TO RECORD THE REPORT ON THE BASIS THAT IT WAS A MATTER CONCERNING THE AIR FORCE, NOT THE POLICE.

I HAVE ALSO ATTACHED PORTIONS OF THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION BULLETIN RELATING TO THESE SIGHTINGS.WE WILL BE NEEDING THIO INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE RE-INVESTIGATION OF THIS CASE.

I THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD WRITE TO YOU AND GIVE YOU ALL THE DETAILS ON THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS CASE RELATING TO THE OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THESE MEN. IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS OR NEED ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

WE HAVE COMPLETED DUPLICATING THE CASES FROM THE FIRST 12 AS WE WOULD HERE HAVE THIS PORTION OF THE PROJECT COMPLETED. MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION INCLUDING MAPS OF THE WITNESSES HOMES AND OTHER PERTINENT DATA IS A SEPARATE ENCLOSURE.
