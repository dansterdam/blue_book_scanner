Here is the text from the document:

When it changed its course and
flew southeast until I could not
see it any further.
I feel that something should be
done to find out what these aerial
phenomena are and what their
purpose. But I did not know
where to start until someone
suggested that I write the Michigan
City Times-Dispatch. That was it.
They suggested that I phone the
Air Force and give me the phone
number, which I did.
I am enclosing a note from
the State Police at a Chesterton
number, which I did, and
also suggested that I write to the
Wright-Patterson AFB
