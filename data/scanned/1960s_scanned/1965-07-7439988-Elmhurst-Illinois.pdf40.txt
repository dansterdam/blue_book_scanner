In Portland and Salem, Oregon and Spokane, Washington, on the night of July 29, 1965, several objects "hovered" in the sky. One individual described a bright green, dinner-plate sized object descending rapidly. According to the individual, the object "was the size of a dinner plate", he said, and appeared to extinguish itself before ascending rapidly. The incident was reported from Portland International Airport, where an official said there was a flashing light in the sky from the south end of the field.

A retired Army Captain pointed out that Spokane had a report of 5 objects which "hovered" over the city and maneuvered rapidly, and a man from Seattle who was visiting Spokane had reported seeing an object and a group of 11 others watched the objects one in the northwest and one in the southeast, flashing on and off, into position and then began blinking their lights, which moved slowly into position and then became blinking lights.

The final object was observed at 1:30 a.m. on the 31st. He said a third object hovered near the other two for a short period, prior, a Spokane County Deputy Sheriff reported observing objects which were white in color with red overtones. No further details.
