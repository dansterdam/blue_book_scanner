3. Internal surfaces are severely corroded, indicating a more corrosive environment internally. The lack of corrosion on the outside (even though paint was removed) indicates a less corrosive environment for very long. Analysis of the corrosion products did not provide any clue to the possible contents.

4. A survey for residual alpha, beta or gamma radiation was negative.

2. Discussion.

We have not been able to establish the intended use of this device. The following possible applications were considered but not confirmed:

The design was considered as a waste disposal container for radioactive materials. However, it would not be an efficient container from a payload point of view since only half (one hemisphere) could be loaded. Nonetheless, it was found that this was not comparable to any radioactive waste containers they have handled.

Wave and blast protective shell for instrumentation exposed to shock wave and blast pressures. Samples were obtained which showed sufficient strength to withstand something like the one now under consideration. In support of atomic tests in Nevada. However, the process of manufacture and the materials used did not indicate that this was the type used by them.

For a portable submersible test device. Not a likely application since there are no external connections for anything, and additional tests are contemplated without further instructions from your office.
