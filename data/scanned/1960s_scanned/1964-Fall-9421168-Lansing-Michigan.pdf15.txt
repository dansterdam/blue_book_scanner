Rush of Sightings in Quebec
In the last part of August 1963 many
sightings of unidentified flying objects were
reported in the Province of Quebec, Canada.
Specific dates were given the following
French language report:
Between the 24th and 31st of August, several
sightings were made by different observers in
the area of Saint-Jerome, about 25 miles north
of Montreal.
At Chariesville, also about 25 miles north of
Montreal, on the 27th of August, Mrs. Alarie
saw a round bright light in the sky for about
30 minutes. On the 28th, three witnesses saw
a luminous object which seemed to lower itself
gradually and then rose upwards again.
On the third September, Mrs. Aline
Perreault, in Repentigny, 10 miles northeast
of Montreal, saw an unidentified object with
colored lights flying at high speed and
disappearing in the distance.
F. (no name) saw a round brilliant with
a dome-shaped structure and colored lights
over the Cartierville area on September 5.
On the third December an unidentified
object was observed southwest from
St. Hubert International Airport near
Montreal. The RCAF tower controllers and
airline pilots observed the object maneuver
rapidly at high altitudes with occasional
bursts of speed followed by a complete stop
and then a sharp change of direction. No
satisfactory explanation for the sightings
was given.
