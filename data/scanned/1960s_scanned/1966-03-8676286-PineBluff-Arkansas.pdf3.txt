There is no photograph present in the provided image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document.

no multi-color appearance; no streaking, blinking, winking, seeming circus acts as is indicated in the attached clippings. The object was perfectly still. The red signal was proof that this thing was some sort of mechanical flying vehicle or plane of some sort. This report of the object I witnessed is for what it may be of interest of our government.

Sincerely,
