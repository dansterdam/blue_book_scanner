R. RICHARD E. MCCLARY, MAJOR, USAF, 753RD AACS, PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION REVEALS NOTHING THAT FAVORABLY COMPARES WITH THE REPORTED SIGHTING(S). INDIVIDUALS DESCRIBED OBJECTS THAT APPARENTLY WERE VERY SIMILAR, HOWEVER, A DISCREPANCY EXISTS IN THE REPORTED TIMES OF SIGHTINGS. THE INDEPENDENT ACTIVITY NORTH OF AUSTIN COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE OBJECTS(S) AT APPROXIMATELY 30 DEGREES ELEVATION. VIEWING THE OBJECTS THROUGH HIGH CIRRUS CLOUDS COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE DISCREPANCY OF THE INDEPENDENT ACTIVITY.
