To whom it may concern:

It was suggested to me by a local High School teacher that I write a letter to you and find some sort of an explanation of what I saw in the sky on July 7, 1965. First of all, let me say that we live away from the town, so I have a clear view of the sky. I am much interested in the matter, and the Satellites--whenever the Scho for the past five (or six) years--whenever I chance to spot it going over, I have watched it with the aid of a time-table published in some local paper, but lately, there being no time-tables published, I go out at various times, and a lot of the time I spot it, so I watch it go over. Last night it appeared to be about 6:30 when I chanced to spot it, and when it was directly overhead, I happened to look to the West, and up over the horizon appeared what at first looked like a shooting star--but with the light flashing off and on, and it moved in a complete orbit across the sky, passing the Scho when it was just past the zenith. I watched it until it disappeared in the Eastern horizon--all this took with seemed to be less than a minute. It was definitely not an airplane--jet or otherwise, I've seen enough of them go over at night to know one. It was the same size as a star, with a regular flashing of light--off and on, while moving across the sky, worth of doing this for any worth as-good-as-mine basket, but I've at least told someone about it. I'm hoping this won't be ignored completely, and that I may get some sort of an answer.

Yours sincerely,
