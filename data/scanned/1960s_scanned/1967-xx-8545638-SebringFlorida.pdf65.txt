There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this document. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text describing an incident or sighting.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 19 day January 1967 year
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
The object the car stalled. Lights and our radio all went off at the same time. After this I tried to start the car twice while the object remained. To do this I tured the ignition switch but the radio would be drawing too much power from the battery of the car, I shut the light switch the radio off. Then I tried to start the car again twice. It did not start. Next, the object began to move away. I tried to start the car again immediately but it would not. At this time I pulled up into my grandmother's driveway. I had to call my father. The car remained in good order, the battery was not drained, since we had no trouble starting it later. At this time I believe that it was the car's fault. I had the cables to the side of the road to stop.
