Mr. Powers and said that in his opinion the objects described were merely advertising airplanes flashing lights for advertising purposes, and that the reports about the objects being observed did not reflect a bona fide sighting.

At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Richard Pratt, 17, of East Longmeadow, Mass., heard a whistling sound coming from the north, and after watching for a few minutes observed a silver disc-shaped object descending at a rapid rate behind trees or shrubs in his yard. The object appeared to be about 300 yards away and was seemingly about four feet above the hill. Pratt told the investigator that it appeared to be slowly descending behind the shrubbery.

Richard told Mr. Fowler that he went into the house and told his mother he was afraid. He decided to investigate, but his mother dissuaded him because she also was afraid. During the course of the investigation, the investigator contacted personnel at the Lennox Hill Nursing Home, which is located in the vicinity of Pratt's home, and they were unable to account for the sighting.

The investigator points out that an electrical Power Station is located behind the Lennox Hill Nursing Home. A similar light in the general area has been described by APRO member Walter Webb of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as an observation he had looked almost identical to the one Pratt had seen.
