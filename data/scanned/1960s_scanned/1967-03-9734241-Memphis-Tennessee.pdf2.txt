Indicates any additional information about yourself, including any special experiences, which might be pertinent.

I was a housewife of over 20 years. About 5-10 years ago I saw 2-3 unusual looking objects in the daytime sky. They were circular in shape, aluminum or silver in color, and moved in a way that seemed unnatural for ordinary aircraft. They were noticed by several other people who also wondered what they were. This occurred in the [REDACTED] area. I am not certain of the exact dates and would have to reconstruct from memory when I saw them. The objects were visible for 5-10 minutes each time.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?

I have talked to several neighbors and acquaintances who recall also seeing the objects I saw. I do not remember any specific date I reported this to anyone.
