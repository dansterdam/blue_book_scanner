Schlanders, Tirol, 27 Dec 62

Here in Schlanders, from the hospital, I saw a large, luminous mass 
fall from the sky on Tuesday evening, the 18th of December 1962, between
about 7 and 7:30.

The mass probably fell in the mountains or woods - not on any populated 
area, as I was unable to see the object hit the ground because a balcony wall 
cuts off my view of the view from my window.

I asked the local forest ranger to keep the matter in mind when
on his patrols.

I am enclosing some clippings from our newspaper "Dolomiten". They 
induced me to inform you of the above events. Who knows, perhaps there is
some connection.

Yours truly,
(Red Cross nurse)

(The enclosed two clippings, dated Washington 19 and 21 December, report
that "personal 24-hour 'watch was kept at the site where this luminous object 
fell to earth")
