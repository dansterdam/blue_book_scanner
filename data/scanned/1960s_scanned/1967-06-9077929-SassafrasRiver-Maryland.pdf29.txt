There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a proposed reply to a letter regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation.

Proposed reply to letter from 15 June 1967 (sightings 7 June)

Dear [redacted],

Reference your recent observation of an unidentified flying object. The Project Blue Book office has received information from [redacted] Air Force Base, Illinois, concerning your observation. If the base UFO investigator is able to determine what was responsible for the sighting, then the report is not forwarded to our office. The base investigator is in a much better position to quickly investigate sightings from your area than members of the Project Blue Book office.

If the Chanute AFB investigator found that an aircraft was in the immediate area making instrument landings, then this could have been what you observed. Such aircraft on instrument missions have been responsible for UFO sightings in the past.

If any airline craft had been in the area, our radar sensors and our aircraft crews would have certainly detected such an event. We have received no additional reports from your area on the date of your sighting.
