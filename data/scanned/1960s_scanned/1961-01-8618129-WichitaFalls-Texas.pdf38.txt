6. Statement from Mr.

On 15 January from approximately 0315Z to approximately 0330Z an unidentified flying object was sighted by several reliable witnesses from the base horizon to approximately 35 degrees above the horizon. The object was described as circular, bright orange in color and appeared to be slowly moving in a horizontal direction toward the northwest. The attached statements are based on information received from witnesses to the incident. The results of the preliminary investigation indicate that the number of witnesses, the reliability of the observing personnel, the common description of the object, and the correlation of sightings tend to lend credence to the report. However, no determination of the exact nature or identity of the object can be made since the causes or identity of the observed phenomenon are unable to be determined.
