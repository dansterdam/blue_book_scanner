The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a photo analysis report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NUMBER 66-23
DATE OF REPORT 9 June 1966
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION GRAND WASHIGNTON
DATE January 1966
PHOTOGRAPHY
A. This - 1 print, 1 negative
QUALITY Good
PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 66-56 from Major M. Quintanilla, USAF, Directorate of Information, Unidentified Aerials Phenomena Branch.
ANALYSIS: This analysis was completed jointly by the Photo Analysis and Photo Processing Sections. From an analysis of the print and negatives, it was determined that the image does not appear to be that of any defined object. The image could have been caused by some natural light effect or mechanical malfunction of the camera. In fact, the image does not appear to be sufficiently clear to enable any definite conclusions regarding its identity. Therefore, this image appears to be the most reasonable explanation of the incident.
