The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The image shows a blank space where a response to the question "Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting" would have been filled out.

Text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: NOV 2 *
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
