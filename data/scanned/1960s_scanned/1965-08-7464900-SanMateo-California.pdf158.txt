SCIENTIST REFUTES AIR FORCE CLAIM THAT HUGE WESTERN SAUCER FLAP WAS CAUSED BY ID BY UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS WHICH WERE SIGHTED OVER VAST AREA DURING JULY 2 AND AUGUST 2, 1965. SIGHTINGS WERE REPORTED IN MANY AREAS FROM MID-WEST AND WEST AND SOUTH-WEST WHERE THE OBJECTS WERE SAID BY THE AIR FORCE TO BE THE PLANET JUPITER OR SATELLITES OF JUPITER. BUT SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF WITNESSES STATEMENTS SHOWS THE OBJECTS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN JUPITER. SAID WITNESSES EMPHATICALLY DID NOT SEE JUPITER OR ANY OF THE BRIGHT SATELLITES WELL KNOWN TO ASTRONOMERS. SOMEBODY HAS MADE A MISTAKE. THESE STARS AND PLANETS ARE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THAT TIME OR YEAR PERIOD FROM KANSAS, TEXAS, OKLAHOMA, NEW MEXICO, COLORADO, SOUTH DAKOTA, NEBRASKA, AND WYOMING. IN ADDITION TO NUMEROUS SIGHTINGS, SOME OF THE OBJECTS WERE TRACKED ON RADAR. THE AIR FORCE STATED, AFTER A VERY SUPERFICIAL INVESTIGATION, THAT THE SIGHTINGS WERE PROBABLY OF THE PLANET JUPITER OR ITS MINOR PLANETS. UNBELIEVABLE.
