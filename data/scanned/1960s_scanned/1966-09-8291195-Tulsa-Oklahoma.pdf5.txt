Dear as we as we could,
I made a sighting of what must have been a flying sauc4er. It seemed to come straight down
from a second or so when the top winked out and came straight out
My name inside of a hel3_copter or small plane on a regular flight or
perhaps a large balloon or blimp. However it was only visible for
a few seconds, andat a considerable distance, so I was not able to
make out many details. It seemed quite large and moved rapidly.
This is the sighting I described , and I am reporting it to you
as requested. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Sincerely,
Cadet Carot Van Meter

P.S. No photographs were made as it was very difficult to realize
in the time available that an unusual sighting was taking place.
