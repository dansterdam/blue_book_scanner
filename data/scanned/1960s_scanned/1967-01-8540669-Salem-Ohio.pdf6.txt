East, 1 1/2 mile approx from here. This past summer a craft was observed hovering over a wheat field, evidently searching the area. It was sighted briefly on several occasions. As it hovered it was absolutely silent. We feel certain it was not a conventional aircraft.

It occurred during the day, about 10:15 a.m. The object in the sky was first sighted as a white light, and as it came closer we could see that it was a circular shaped craft, apparently metallic in appearance. As it maneuvered in the sky it seemed to change in size, sometimes appearing smaller and at other times larger. It remained in view for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.  

The diameter appeared to be between 40 to 50 feet. The speed when it left was estimated to be 2,000 to 3,000 ft. a sec. The whitish light seemed to emanate from the whole craft. There was no sound or exhaust of any kind noted.
