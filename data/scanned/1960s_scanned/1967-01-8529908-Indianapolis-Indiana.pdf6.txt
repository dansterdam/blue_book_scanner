On 12 January 1967 Mrs. [redacted] of [redacted] Road, Indianapolis called. At 0645 this morning her children were waiting for school when they and she noticed an unidentified object in sky. The light flashed on and off real slow. It stayed their for about ten minutes. It just finally hovered way. It went real real slow. The lights on and off lights were flashing and there were across the street. I was looking toward East. Could see it moving away then it just went out of sight. Kind of vanished. Didn't move across the sky. Didn't move, up or left. When it started to turn light the object left. Sun was quite up yet. Lt. Marley asked if she would complete a FFD Form and she agreed that she would. Form 164 was forwarded to Mrs. [redacted] on 23 Jan 67.
