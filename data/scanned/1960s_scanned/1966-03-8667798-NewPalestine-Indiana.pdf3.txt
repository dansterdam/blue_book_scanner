Dear Sir:
I never thought I would ever see an object so low and nearly as long as a football field! My wife, her brother, and I were traveling east on US 40 near New Palestine, Indiana. The time was around 9:00 PM on March 17, 1966. As we approached the sighting location, we saw a very bright light and several smaller lights attached to it. It was hovering about 30-40 feet above the ground and flying in a crooked S-like formation. Since then, several people have reported seeing the same or similar objects in this area.
