Dear sir:

Cause of sighting: Bright light object with a trail. Subject sighting was on May 27, 1962, while driving along Lincoln Park, Michigan, with 4 other persons in the car. The object was first observed about 20 feet above the ground, moving very rapidly in a southwesterly direction. It was observed for approximately 3 to 4 seconds. The object appeared to be round with a bright, pulsating light. There was a white trail visible behind the object. The object appeared to diminish in size as it moved away. No sound was heard.

As there were 4 people in the car who also observed the object, I believe the sighting to be authentic. The object was not a conventional aircraft, as it had no wings or tail, and its speed and maneuverability were far beyond that of any known aircraft.
