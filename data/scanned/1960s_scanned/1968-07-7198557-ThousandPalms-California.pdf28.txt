I am the witness who telephoned in the report of the unidentified flying object sighted in the vicinity of Thousand Palms, California on the night of July 7, 1968. As I mentioned in my telephone report, I have been an aircraft mechanic in the U.S. Air Force for over six years. I am thoroughly familiar with the silhouettes and flight characteristics of practically all military and commercial aircraft in use today. The object I observed could not have been any type of known aircraft.

The incident occurred at approximately 9:30 p.m. as I was driving home from work. I was traveling south on Highway 111 about 2 miles north of Thousand Palms when I first sighted the object. At first I thought it was merely a bright star, but as I continued to observe it, the object began to change position in the sky. It appeared to be hovering at first, then suddenly it accelerated and moved rapidly in a southeast direction, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. The speed with which it moved was incredible - far greater than any aircraft I have ever seen. The object appeared to be oval in shape and was giving off a bright orange glow. I estimate that it was at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet.

I am convinced that what I saw was not an aircraft of any kind, but rather some type of unidentified flying object. As an experienced aircraft mechanic, I can state with certainty that the performance characteristics of the object I observed were beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. I hope this report will be of assistance in your investigation of this incident.
