The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document that appears to be part of a UFO report from Project Blue Book. 

Text from the document:

EVALUATION: The witnesses were sincere and excited about their sighting. They stated that the object was as bright as the sun and appeared to be about 50 yards long and 30 yards wide. It was described as shaped like a dumbbell and was surrounded by a blue or blue-green light which flashed and flickered. The object hovered, accelerated, and then disappeared in about 20 seconds. The Air Force evaluation was that there was nothing unusual or unidentifiable about the object. The report indicates that the object was probably a military flare or meteorological balloon which the witnesses mistook for a UFO.

I PROMPTLY REFERRED THE CASE TO THE U.S. WEATHER BUREAU FOR ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION BY THEIR METEOROLOGICAL EXPERTS. THEY STATED THAT THIS CASE 15 PROBABLY A METEOROLOGICAL BALLOON RELEASE BY A HOSPITAL OR MEDICAL COLLEGE IN THE AREA, AS THIS IS A COMMON PRACTICE IN OBTAINING UPPER ATMOSPHERE WEATHER DATA.
