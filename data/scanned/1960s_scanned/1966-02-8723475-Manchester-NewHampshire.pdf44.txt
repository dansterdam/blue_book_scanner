PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 66-21
PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT 10 June 1966

SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ANALYSIS
LOCATION MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
DATE 26 February 1966

PHOTOGRAPHY:
AF P HRS IR QUALITY
One negative, one 5" x 7" print, one cropped enlargement

1. PURPOSE: This report is written for Major H. Quintanilla, TDEW/UFO, in answer to Work Order Number 65-414 requesting an analysis of the unidentified image on the referenced photographs.

2. ANALYSIS: Analysis was conducted jointly by the Photo Analysis Division, TDPA, and the Photo Interpretation Division, TDPF.

3. ONLY one true image appears on the negative. This image appears as a white ball on the 5" x 7" print. Under close examination, the image appears to be smooth, indicating little or no evidence of a hard image within the center of the white ball. There is little or no evidence of camera motion or image motion. There is little or no indication of the object's actual size, distance, or altitude. This photograph indicates the weather was clear and dry and that it was a bright night with many stars. This photograph should be credible at the image photographed was no brighter than many normal stars.

4. We are unable to make a positive identification of the image. Information necessary for a more definite analysis is lack of a claim, type of claim, lens data, focal length, exposure data, and distance from camera to object. Perhaps it should be noted that the reports of UFO sightings are sometimes, in part, the result of a subjective response concerning the appearance and movement of the object.
