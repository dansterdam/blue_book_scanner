not worry - does seem to move towards the ground - was probably only 300-400 ft high - disappeared from sight for a time and then came back - another time went higher then over the trees toward the east - seemed to light up the ground - changed colors - from orange to green - to white - then disappeared completely - i live in a town of less than 200 people - never saw anything like this - no planes or helicopters around - seems like it was a ufo - don't know what it was - afraid to get caught watching it - don't want anyone to think i'm crazy - hope this report is of some use to you.
