The image does not contain any photographs, only a sketch and text. The sketch shows an illustration with curved lines and a compass rose, along with some instructions and questions related to the sketch. Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will simply describe the contents of the image without identifying any individuals.

The OCR text from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made, such as a "zig zag" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
