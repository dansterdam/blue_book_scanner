Positive identification of the nautical ship near the sighting location could not be obtained. The captain's statement and corroborating information from the on-board crew indicate the UFO activity observed was genuine in nature and could not be readily explained as a conventional aerial or nautical vehicle. Further investigation is warranted to determine the nature and origin of the sightings.
