The image appears to be a grainy, black-and-white photograph showing a blurred, indistinct object or phenomenon. There is a small, bright spot that could be the focus of the image, but the overall image quality is poor and the subject is difficult to discern.

CASE NO. 12137
FINAL REPORT
PREPARED BY: NRA PROJECT BLUE BOOK
DATE: 6 November 1967
LOCATION: Covington, Indiana
REPORT OF AERIAL PHENOMENON

1. DESCRIPTION OF AERIAL PHENOMENON:
The witness reported observing a bright, luminous object in the night sky on 11/6/67 at approximately 8:30 PM EST. The object was described as circular in shape, approximately the size of a baseball held at arm's length, and emitting a white, glowing light. The witness stated the object hovered silently for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

2. INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS:
Interviews with the witness and examination of the photographic evidence provided were conducted by Project Blue Book investigators. The photographic evidence, while of poor quality, appears to show a luminous spot consistent with the witness' description. No other physical evidence or corroborating witness statements were obtained.

3. CONCLUSION:
Based on the limited information available, this case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The witness provided a credible account, and the photographic evidence, though poor in quality, appears to support the reported observation. However, without additional physical evidence or witness statements, a definitive determination of the nature of the aerial phenomenon cannot be made.
