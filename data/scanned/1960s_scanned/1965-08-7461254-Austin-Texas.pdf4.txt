17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and tell us how much of the object would have been covered by the match head.
The object was several times larger than a match head, perhaps a foot long.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the shape or the object as you saw it such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails if you noticed them as the object was moving.
