U.S.A. Uneed
to Mind Some
About UFOs

A rising interest in unident ified aerial phenom.
ena, generally called "flying saucers" or "UFOs"
has resulted in much public speculation and dis-
cussion. There is a considerable volume of in-
formation, much of it conflicting and confusing,
on the subject. The following information is be-
lieved to be reasonably accurate and objective.

WHAT ARE UFOs?
UFOs are any aerial phenomena which can-
not be identified immediately as a known object
or phenomenon. They are not necessarily of ex-
traterrestrial origin. Many reported UFOs are
later identified as natural phenomena, man-made
objects, or "fakes" but others defy explanation.
All reported UFOs are carefully investigated by
the United States Air Force under a program
called Project Blue Book.

RELIABILITY OF WITNESSES
Witnesses to UFO sightings are of all types:
pilots, scientists, engineers, military personnel,
and citizens of all backgrounds. In general, the
reliability of witnesses is considered quite high.
But it should be remembered that even trained
observers can be mistaken, and that the descrip-
tions and interpretations of sightings can vary
greatly, depending on the background and per-
ception of the witness.

REASONS FOR INVESTIGATION
UFOs are investigated for several reasons:
(1) To determine if they represent a threat to
the national security of the United States. 
(2) To attempt to identify unknown or unrecog-
nized aerial phenomena.
(3) To collect and evaluate any scientific data
that may result. 
(4) To maintain public confidence by providing
factual information on the subject.
