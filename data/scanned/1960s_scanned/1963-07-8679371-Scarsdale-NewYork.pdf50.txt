Chelmsford UFO
Mr. Ronald Crowell, aged 31, of 10 Taunton Road, Chelmsford, reported that on July 29, 1963, at about 9 p.m., he observed a glowing object in the sky some distance off. He first noticed it through the trees in his garden and watched it for a period of about 30 seconds. The object was near the top of the trees, which obstructed his view to some extent. For a period of about 30 seconds he observed it as it moved slowly to the northeast. He had a clear view of it as it passed through a gap in the trees. The object appeared to be circular in shape and emitted a bright glow. It seemed to be approximately 150 to 200 yards in diameter. The object was near the top of the trees, which were about 50 to 60 feet high. He estimated its height above the ground to be 70 to 80 feet. He said that as it moved, it appeared to lift or tilt to bring it to the horizontal, and the object seemed to be rotating or turning as it moved. His brother had the definite impression that it was a solid, structured object, not a reflection or optical illusion. The object disappeared after about 3 or 4 minutes. Mr. Crowell said the object was a "small, meteorological unit of the Royal Aircraft Establishment" and had been released by theodolite.
