I am not a ufo expert. on the details of this case, i can only describe what is contained in the report. the report gives the date, time, location, and physical description of the object observed, as well as the witness accounts and the investigative findings. i would suggest referring to the report itself for the specifics of this particular ufo sighting incident.
