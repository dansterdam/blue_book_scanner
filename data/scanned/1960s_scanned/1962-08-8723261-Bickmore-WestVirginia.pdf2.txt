NO CASE (Information Only)

Roda & Rann, Norway

GLACIER SIGHTINGS: Norway - 8/17/62: Flying Saucers Over Glacier. Two of them were seen over the Svartisen glacier about 1900 hrs. They were oval shaped, 4-5 meters in diameter and about 2 meters high. They were seen close above the glacier surface for about 15 minutes, then they moved away eastwards at a high speed, and disappeared.

Later at about 2130 hrs, the glacier was again overflown by two similar objects, which were seen for about 10 minutes. After that they disappeared. Reporting officer: Chief Constable, Batnfjordsora, Norway. Report states that witnesses were considered to be reliable and their observations confirmed by two others. It was reported as an U.F.O. incident in reports. 
BUT this balloon on enquiry was found to have been released from a Norwegian training ship at sea about 65 miles away. The oval shaped appearance and high speed probably due to the angle of view and the distance involved. The witnesses did not fit the usual U.F.O. pattern and the case is considered to have a probable explanation as a balloon release.
