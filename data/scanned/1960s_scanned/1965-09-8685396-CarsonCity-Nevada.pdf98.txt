The text in the article is as follows:

"Police in three southwestern Oklahoma cities were deluged with telephone calls reporting strange objects in the sky. Witnesses said they showed colors from white to orange.

Six New Mexico sightings were reported at Hobbs, Carlsbad and Artesia City. 

In Bartlesville, Oklahoma, residents told police they saw an object about the size of a plane going down southwest of Bartlesville or a large craft hovering. 

A local city resident reported he saw an object move across the sky, changing colors from red to white and back to red. He said it flew about a minute and then appeared to hover or to traverse the sky from horizon to horizon.

First sighting report Sunday night was from the area between Purcell and Norman. However, officials could not verify any moving objects in the sky but said a very brilliant light was visible both that evening and the following morning.

Despite all the reports, some of them contradictory, some well-versed in flying object reports say this latest incident may not be too significant."
