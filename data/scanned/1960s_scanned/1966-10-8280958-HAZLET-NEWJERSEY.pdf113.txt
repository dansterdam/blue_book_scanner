The report of unidentified sighting.
The object reportedly passed low
directly over. The object was quite
brilliant and seemed to move
erratically with a bright light on
one side and a white light on the other
side. At times it hovered and at
other times it seemed to dart very
rapidly in one direction or another.
The viewing time was about 10
minutes. There was no sound associated
with the object.
