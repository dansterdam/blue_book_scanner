Bright Globe Over Wisconsin
A radio announcer at Marshfield and a newspaper operator at Marshfield, Wisconsin, apparently viewed the same UFO over Marshfield the early morning of 8 November 1964, according to the APRO Bulletin, January 65.
The announcer, Jack Thornton, reported seeing a "bright globe-shaped object", 3' or 4' in diameter, at 1:30 a.m. He said it moved from southeast to north, then returned to the path. Thornton also observed it at 4:30 a.m. and said it moved in a zigzag pattern over Marshfield at that time.
