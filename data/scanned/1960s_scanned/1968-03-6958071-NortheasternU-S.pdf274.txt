According to the text in the image, the key points are:

"These objects were observed about 9:40 P.M. - 10:00 P.M. on March 6, 1968 in the eastern sky over Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.

There were about 30-40 lights in the sky - some appeared larger and brighter than others. The objects remained in the sky for about 20 minutes.

The witness described the lights as being 'about a mile apart', 'not too high up', and 'not too far away'. The objects were also described as 'very distinct' and 'quite bright'.

The lights did not blink or move during the sighting, but suddenly disappeared. The witness stated that they could not explain what the objects were."
