Bright, oblong shaped light above Bald Eagle Ridge silently approaching, changed color from white to pink, and back to white. It would appear and disappear. We finally came up within a few hundred yards of it and it seemed to go downwards behind a hill. Could not determine distance or size but it was very clear and bright, it made no sound whatever.
We kept on traveling, the object seemed stationary but started to dim and went out. Things actually resembled aircraft in the sky but now instead of a light, a faint silhouette or outline could be seen against the sky, it then suddenly appeared again as a bright, round, pink light. We stopped and got out of the car, it then seemed to move up and down but always staying in one location. It was a very clear night and stars were visible, the object was definitely higher than the stars. We were convinced it must be U.P.O. as it did not resemble any type of aircraft we had ever seen.
We were convinced it must be a U.F.O. because of its speed, its ability to change color and disappear, reappear, move up and down and stay in one location, which we felt was not characteristic of any known aircraft. It must be at least a mile away and yet the light was so bright it seemed close up.
