Dear Sir:
On April 7th of the present year I reported all a 6:57 P.M. sighting, and I would like to have more information.
Could you send me the Air Force fact sheet on this unidentified aerial sighting? 
I am sorry that my report of the Blue Book about 1952 or more can not the first one ever since then, but the minor are too many to enumerate.
It was longer to obtain of the A.F.O. documents than one in Chicago â€“ could be have the address to $5 in the right of the report, so I should be pleased to acquire a complete sighting report.
Could you send you me this information, and apologizing in the A.F.O. departments.
