The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch shows a compass rose diagram with instructions on how to indicate the direction of the observed phenomenon. The smaller sketches show two landscape scenes, one with a person standing in the center and the other showing a more distant landscape view.

4A. Now imagine you are at the center of the compass rose. Place an "X" on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when first seen. Place a "B" on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when last seen.

In the sketch below, place an "X" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a "B" at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. Indicate whether the phenomenon appeared to be straight, curved or zig-zag. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
