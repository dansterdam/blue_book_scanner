UFO SIGHTING (ST CLAIR COUNTY, MICHIGAN)
CASE 13-G-62

1. The following information is provided to assist you in a reply to Congressman Harvey regarding a UFO sighting in Saint Clair County, Michigan, on 12 NOV 62.

2. It is believed that the object sighted by Deputy Baker was a helicopter. However, efforts to identify a specific vehicle have proved negative. Reasons for this belief are as follows:

a. During telephone conversation between Doctor J Allen Hynek and Deputy Baker, information received indicated that this was the most probable cause. 

b. A helicopter was observed during the daylight hours on subsequent days by other persons in the area and their stories of the observations were carried in local newspapers. 

c. Efforts to identify these subsequent observations with a particular helicopter proved negative.

3. Should Congressman Harvey desire further investigative efforts to identify a particular helicopter activity in the area, officials at AJrD may be directed to conduct this investigation. However, we feel that additional expenditures of funds and manpower is not warranted in view of the long delay in time since the sighting occurred. Also, we feel there is sufficient evidence to justify an evaluation of this sighting as a helicopter observation.
