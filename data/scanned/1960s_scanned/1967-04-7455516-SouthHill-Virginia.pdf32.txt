Samples were taken from three areas (identified by slips of paper inside the packing in the three plastic containers). Material was taken from the center of the burned patch, from the center of an area which a trooper had blackened by applying a lighted flare to it, or fuse, and from an area well away from any affected part of the road. The samples were scraped up with the end of a tire-iron, which was painted black.

An attempt was then made to get casts of the three holes which were not as well-defined as the northeast hole. Sgt. Raines poured plaster of Paris into these holes with paper clips arranged to permit pulling out the plugs. It was anticipated that some difficulty might be encountered, so the best hole was left untouched. The southeast hole gave the most difficulty due to its depth; finally the road had to be chipped carefully away from the cast, not, however, without damaging the cast. All recoverable pieces are enclosed. Material which adhered to the casts was left on them. The other two casts were pulled out directly with only minor damage. These casts are wrapped in cotton in the empty cotton-box, which also contains the envelope with the matches in it. In retrospect, of course, one can think of several more intelligent ways to obtain impressions of the holes without damaging them, such as using modeling clay or wax.
