There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page of handwritten text from a Project Blue Book document.

The text reads:

We are very interested in finding out all we can about these sightings and would appreciate any help you can offer.

P.S. Nothing that made a wonder about this low and clear but made one sound.

Thank you very much
Sincerely
