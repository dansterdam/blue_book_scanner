Weather here has been very overcast, with no time
seem many of these objects in daylight as
raining weather. I believe they fly higher the usual
of the sighting are accidental, not
planned sightings, as there must have been
many more of them missed. To the east where the
weather cleared, I have been watching at
different times during the evening, but there not
many up there.

On the night of July 6, 1967 about 1:34 I had
a clear and unobstructed view of one of these objects.
It appeared to be hovering or going very slowly just
past my house. I have been trying to do so on over
and will continue it with interest. I have three
more pictures on another roll not yet developed, and
will hold same until I hear from you. On the side
of the 3x5 picture came out very good, the other
side had not come up as bright. I believe there are
the most ------ I have.

I will make another attempt to discribe the object.
I seen at the datacenter a insertion. 
At 10:23 am - I was driving to work on night
road my things on a road with a good view. Brilliantly
bright object about the size of a coin at arm's length
not making any unusual maneuvers. While watching, it
disappeared. I waited for traffic to stop. I could
not locate it further.
