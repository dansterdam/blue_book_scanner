16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE WHEN HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT OR UTILITY POLE? SINCE NO KNOWN OBJECTS OF KNOWN SIZE WERE AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, IT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE FIELD OF VIEW THE PHENOMENON WOULD OCCUPY.
