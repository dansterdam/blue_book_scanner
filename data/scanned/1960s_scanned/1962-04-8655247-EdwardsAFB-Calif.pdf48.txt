The image contains a photograph depicting the head and upper body of a human figure. The figure appears to be wearing some type of headgear or helmet. The photograph is accompanied by the title "John Glenn and His Day of Miracles" and a caption that describes the moment as "a new scene" and mentions "Colonel Glenn" and "the United States".

The text in the document reads as follows:

"THIS was the moment. He had covered a distance of 302, miles in his three-orbit run around the earth on his back on a form-fit couch in the Friendship 7 capsule guided and guarded by his team of technicians and waited for Col. John Herschel Glenn Jr. to emerge, a dramatic first for the United States.

"This," said President Kennedy, "is a new scene, and President Eisenhower and others who have prepared for this moment. We are under the water today, but through this miracle, we have sent a pilot hurtling through space, the first American to go into space and come back. We have established contact, and as to the condition of Colonel Glenn, we await further details."
