2. LOCATION: Ponce, Puerto Rico
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local 5:28-5:40 p.m.
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: G Ground-Radar
5. EQUIPMENT: G Air-Visual, G Ground-radar, G Air-intercept radar
6. DURATION: 12 min.
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Short
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: As object closely N of the sun, so close that it could only be seen by shielding eyes from the sun. (The object was not close because observation was through considerable atmosphere where it was shining like a bright star.) One source reported that it was approximately the size of a quarter at arm's length. After this period of very close proximity, the object was lost to sight.
11. COMMENTS: "The object Venus was 7 degrees removed from the sun in a westward direction at the time. This appears to be a misidentification of the planet which was of magnitude -3.4, and in a position to be seen close to the sun at that time of day."
