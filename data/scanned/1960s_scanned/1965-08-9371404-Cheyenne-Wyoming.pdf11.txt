The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The diagram shows a compass rose with degrees marked around the edges. There is also a sketch of an object or objects in the sky, with instructions to draw a picture showing the path or direction of the object(s).

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown: Place an "X" on the curve line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curve line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the position that the object or objects made, relative to the earth, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
