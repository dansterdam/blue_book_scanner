28. In your opinion, what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
The object was pale white in color and oblong in shape and appeared to be much larger than a normal aircraft. It was at an altitude somewhere between 1500 and 2000 feet and was moving at a fairly high rate of speed, faster than a normal aircraft. The object did not appear to have any lights on it which is unusual for an aircraft. I am uncertain as to what it could have been but it did not appear to be any type of normal aircraft that I am familiar with.
