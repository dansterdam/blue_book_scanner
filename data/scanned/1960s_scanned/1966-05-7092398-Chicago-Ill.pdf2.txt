There is no photograph present in the image. The image contains handwritten text, which I will transcribe as follows:

"Tall building or we last sight of it. There was no sound had no trail just as completely mind yellow ball. It was up several thousand feet. This object was very invisible to the naked eye. I hope I made it clear enough.
