The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   [X]  Day   [ ]  Month   [ ]  Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The person reporting is a minor and some of this report seemed to be vague / considered.
