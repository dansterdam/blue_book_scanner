The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

"August 31, 1962 
Reynoldsville, Pennsylvania

Investigator: Richard Hall
Witness: Mr. and Mrs. Amos Fisher

Witnesses were driving north on State Route 28 near Reynoldsville, Pennsylvania, about 10:30 PM on August 31, 1962, when they observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving closer to them. The light was described as very bright, about the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length. It moved erratically, jerking from side to side and up and down, and disappeared behind some trees. Witnesses estimated the object was about 500 feet above the ground and about one-half mile away.

The object was observed for about 2 to 3 minutes. No sound was heard."
