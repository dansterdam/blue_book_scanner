FLYING SAUCER LANDING IN PERU: A wire service story dated July 24th tells us of a UFO landing on a ranch 50 miles from Lima, Peru. Witnessed by a chemist and his wife, the story says they saw a saucer-shaped object come down in the area and after about 45 minutes the object took off, leaving behind several flattened rocks in the area supposed to have supported it. Several farmers in the area reported to in the article, but no details are described. Meanwhile, a group of men in Peru described a "scientist" who have sighted this flying saucer do exist, and are pictured by beings 5.3 feet tall who are generally similar to us in physical characteristics. The conclusion we are tentatively reaching from the available information is that their conclusions are basically correct, but that caution is necessary since it is round to us like a saucer research group familiar with such sensational reports: and although we agree that their conclusion is basically correct, we must caution our readers that it seems rounded to us like a saucer research group familiar with such sensational reports. 

Lima during the same preceding July 24th, it is obvious that a rind of unusual close encounters has been taking place in Peru, as well as in other South American countries.
