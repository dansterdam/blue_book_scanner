Fireball Over Howth, Ireland
Mr. John Staunton and Mrs. Staunton of Dublin, Ireland were traveling by car to the Summit Inn at Howth Head on the 5th of April 1965 when they observed a UFO. Miss Ward told the Dublin Evening Herald that they were on Clontarf Road when she spotted what appeared to be "a globe of brilliant light" in the sky above the South Dublin Coast. 
On March 31, at 3:30 a.m. Mr. D., who works in a filling depot, saw a brilliant white light come from the west, pass a point in the sky above the planet Mars, hover for a while, then "shoot up" into the sky. It was so bright he could hardly look at it.
On April 7th at 4 a.m., Mr. D. was in about the same spot when he saw, in approximately the same direction as the object on the 31st, a bluish-white pear-shaped object which "shot up" into the sky.
Representatives Austin Byrnes that the object appeared to be the "size" of a tennis ball but could have been very large and at a great distance. It came in from the East, finally disappeared southward. Staunton also said the object appeared to come toward him and then to recede in a kind of "wave motion".
