Hq USAF SAPOICC (Mrs. Hunt)

1. The Air Force has received five reports of unidentified objects which have been sighted in the Laredo, Texas, area. These reports are identified as (1) 1915z, (2) 1930z, (3) 1935z, (4) 1950z, and (5) 2030z. The reports indicate that these objects are white, bright, and silent. They move at high speed and make abrupt changes in direction, but no trail is visible. The objects are estimated to be the size of small aircraft. The duration, motion, and behavior of the objects are consistent with the reports of Project Blue Book.

2. It is suggested that a fact sheet be attached to explain the present Air Force position on unidentified flying objects.
