1. Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographic submission of March 3, 1968.
2. Request information on how long you viewed the unidentified object (local duration).
3. In your original letter you stated that there were fourteen witnesses. If someone is unwilling to give you their names and addresses. 
4. We are returning the negative you forwarded to us. When you photographed the object with a Polaroid camera, the original prints were presumably sent to you. We did not receive these.
5. Please estimate your distance from the telephone pole where the object was located.
6. All data must be submitted so that a complete scientific evaluation may be made. Thank you for your assistance on this matter.
