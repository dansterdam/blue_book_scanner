Transcribing the text in the document:

I would say that it was at a poper 1000 feet, and about 1 mile southwest northeast. I admit that i was not too minutely at the minutiae of this alliance: for instance one could not see the details of the skin or teeth of features, but from the general outline and a distance of other pernance watching while circling slowly almost overhead, I was fairly certain of the details I have set forth. That is why I stopped, and was keeping stock of the details in the noting - trying to see if I could discover anything more in connection with it.

The object was oval in shape, and appeared to be about 40 feet long, with a height, I would estimate, of about 15 feet. It was brilliantly lighted, not like an ordinary light, but with a greenish glow that seemed to flow over and around it. The lighting was not steady, but pulsated in the manner of a neon light. No wheels or other projections could be seen, and there was no sound at all. The outer surface of the thing seemed to be a metallic finish, although it did not reflect light like a mirror. Once or twice it appeared to wobble slightly in its flight, maintaining its forward motion during this period. Other than that, its flight was smooth and steady.

I hope that this description, while not as detailed as I should like, gives you a reasonably accurate idea of what I saw. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.
