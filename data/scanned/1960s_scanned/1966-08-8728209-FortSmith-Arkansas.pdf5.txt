an unusual light. I went outside
and looked through my binoculars
here and saw the light in the sky.
What was it? We were just advertising a fried chicken restaurant."
Capt. Ector said he and his
NCO obtained a sighting of the
object on Aug. 17 at about 11:15
p.m. from the Fort Smith Police Department.
"The description briefly viewed the lights
above Fort Smith by daylight
and with the aid of binoculars. 
His description went this way:
"Four red lights, immobile
but seeming to rotate like a pinwheel, with a blue central light.
There was a pulsing yellow warning blink like the old-fashioned
yellow lights on airport runways."
"One set of red lights, traveling in
a straight line, appeared to be
higher, faster moving, and the
lights were not in a pinwheel formation."
"A blinking white light moved
steadily in the same manner and
proceeded in the same manner."
"What we saw were lights,"
Capt. Ector said.
The sergeant said he observ-
ed these for about an hour. He
said saw crowds of 300-400,
people watching the same object
during the night. Crowds accom-
panied the object for 6-8 miles,
listening to a radio broadcast,
estimated to number in the thousands.
Capt. Ector said he conducted
several other interviews during
the day but "they were listening
types interviews only." He said
the captain particularly saw something unusual last night but
"what, I don't know yet."
He said that since Jan. 1,
1967, there have been 10,007 re-
ports of unidentified flying ob-
jects. The Air Force has inves-
tigated all but 685 to its own
satisfaction.
