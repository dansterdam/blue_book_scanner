The image does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be a document from the University of Pennsylvania with text describing an observation made at the Flower and Cook Observatory on April 15, 1965. The text discusses the observation of a phenomenon starting "pointing 22 west of north and much less certainly may at IPS (another interpretation would give it 25 further to the north)." The document also mentions a "white luminous mass" that was observed south of the Moon and an estimate of the size interpretation. The document is signed and dated June 5, 1965.
