The image contains a compass diagram and some instructions, but no photograph. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" where the object was first seen. Then show high the object was above the horizon (use the "elevation" scale). Place a "B" on the side you last saw the object. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "Y" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
