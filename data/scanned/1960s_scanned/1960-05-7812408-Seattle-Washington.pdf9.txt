SAPER-23 (1/Col Tacker)
1.	The SAPER, the objects reported as alleged UFO's, submitted by Mr. were carefully studied and the objects were determined to be blinking lights, on a window, which is typical of being off as a flying object. The apparent color and characteristics were reported in only general term and gave no light fixtures appearing as unidentified flying objects.
2.	A request was made on 13 July 1960, for an investigation of Bill X X  X.  The investigation was made on 21 July and information will be forwarded to ATC at a later date.
