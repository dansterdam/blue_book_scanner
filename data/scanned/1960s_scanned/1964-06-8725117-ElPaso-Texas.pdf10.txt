El Paso Boy, 14, May Have Films Of Three UFO's
At El Paso, Texas, a 14-year-old boy believes he has filmed three unidentified flying objects. 
The boy, whose name is not given, says he took motion pictures of the three objects on Sunday, June 21. 
He took several pictures which he said showed the objects hovering in the sky. One of them showed two of the objects together, he added.
The youth viewed the objects through a telescope and said they appeared to be circular in shape and shiny. He described them as "dull silver in color."
The boy said he was able to see the objects for about 15 minutes. He added the objects appeared to be going very slowly.
The youth told his parents about the sightings and they in turn notified the Filter Center in El Paso. The Filter Center then notified the Western Air Defense Command Headquarters at Colorado Springs.
We are awaiting information as to whether the films, if developed, will be released for study.
