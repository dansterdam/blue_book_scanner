The image contains a photograph showing a close-up view of a weather balloon. The photograph appears to be part of a document or report related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Identification: According to officials at Perrin Air Force Base, these are large-size weather balloons. They withheld positive identification until they were sure. In the meantime, they were reported as a sighting.
Tests: Tests conducted on the object by officials showed that it is definitely not a flying saucer and is a weather balloon. It was scheduled to be launched but was not due to weather conditions.
Markings: The object had markings and inscriptions on it, indicating that it was a weather monitoring device.
Observation: Witnesses reported seeing four moving objects over the horizon in the early morning. The objects appeared to be dome-shaped and were ascending rapidly.
Light: A bright light was seen shining from the top of the objects.
Observation: The witness watched the objects for about 15 minutes, and they hovered and descended to an altitude of about 2,000 feet before fading from view. He said the objects seemed to play a "lighthearted game" and were "up to something."
