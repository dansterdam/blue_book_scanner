SIGHTING REPORT

WITNESS: JAMES DERRY
AGE: 37
OCCUPATION: MECHANIC

ON AUGUST 7, 1960, AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30 PM, MR. JAMES DERRY REPORTED 
OBSERVING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE SKIES OVER MELBOURNE, 
FLORIDA. MR. DERRY WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK WHEN HE OBSERVED A 
BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY MOVING ERRATICALLY. THE OBJECT SUDDENLY STOPPED, 
HOVERED FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND THEN SHOT OFF AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. 
MR. DERRY PULLED OVER AND WATCHED THE OBJECT UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM
VIEW. HE THEN PROCEEDED TO HIS HOME AND IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES TO REPORT THE SIGHTING.

INVESTIGATING OFFICERS WERE DISPATCHED TO THE AREA BUT WERE UNABLE TO 
LOCATE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OR TRACE OF THE REPORTED OBJECT. HOWEVER, 
LATER THAT NIGHT, A RESIDENT IN A NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD CONTACTED POLICE 
TO REPORT DISCOVERING WHAT APPEARED TO BE DEBRIS FROM A POSSIBLE CRASH
SITE IN A WOODED AREA NEAR HIS HOME. 

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, OFFICERS FOUND SCATTERED PIECES OF WHAT 
SEEMED TO BE SOME KIND OF METALLIC MATERIAL IN THE WOODS. PHOTOGRAPHS 
WERE TAKEN AND THE DEBRIS WAS COLLECTED FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.

THE CASE WAS FORWARDED TO PROJECT BLUE BOOK FOR INVESTIGATION.
