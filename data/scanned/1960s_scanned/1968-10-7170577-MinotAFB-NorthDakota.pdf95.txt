TO COL PULLEN SSD SAC. FROM LT COL QUINTANILLA
REFERENCE YOUR TELESON WITH REGARDS TO MINOR AFS UFO'S. IT IS MY
FEELINGS, AFTER REVIEWING PRELIMINARY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY MOOR,
THAT UFO PAINTED BY B-52 ON RADAR AND ALSO OBSERVED VISUALLY BY IT
AND PERSONNEL ON GROUND IS MOST PROBABLY A PLASMA OF THE BALL-LIGHTNING
CLASS. PLASMAS OF THIS TYPE WILL PAINT ON RADAR AND ALSO AFFECT SOME 
ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT AT CERTAIN FREQUENCIES. PLASMAS ARE NOT 
UNCOMMON, HOWEVER, THEY ARE UNIQUE AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DUPLICATE
IN THE LABORATORY. ALSO BECAUSE OF TIME DURATIONS, FEEL STRONGLY
THAT SOME SECURITY GUARDS AND MAINTENANCE CREW WERE OBSERVING SOME
FIRST MAGNITUDE CELESTIAL BODIES WHICH WERE GREATLY MAGNIFIED IN 
THE INVERSION LAYER AND HAZE WHICH WAS PRESENT AT MINOT DURING THE
PERIOD OF THE UFO OBSERVATIONS.
DO NOT CONSIDER THE PHYSICAL VIOLATION OF THE LOCK AS BEING RELATED
IN ANY WAY WITH UFO'S.
WE CONSIDER THE UFO REPORTS AS FAIRLY ROUTINE, EXCEPT FOR THE PLASMA
OBSERVATION WHICH IS INTERESTING FROM A SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW.
WE WILL STUDY THIS REPORT IN MORE DETAIL WHEN WE RECEIVE THE
RAW DATA FROM MINOT.
