we have just read about air military vehicles of course. they were flying in and out of wightman field on 1 or 2 occasions that I could see, around 7:15 pm to 7:30 pm on 23 february 1967. they were very high and traveling fast. they looked round and glowing and did not appear to leave any trails behind them. when they would appear they would just suddenly be there and then in a short period of time they would just disappear.
