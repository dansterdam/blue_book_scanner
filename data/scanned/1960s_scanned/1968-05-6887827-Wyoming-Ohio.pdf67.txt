The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text extracted from the document:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
SEEMED TO STOP AND START?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP INTO PARTS AND EXPLODE?
GIVE OFF SPARKS?
CHANGE OF BRIGHTNESS? (Except for general dimness with increasing distance)
FLASH OR FLICKER?
CHANGE OR DISAPPEAR?
MAKE A NOISE?
ANY OTHER DETAILS YOU CAN GIVE:
Note: It was at about 9:30-10:00pm, below top of a mountainish, probably where I had observed it slightly in driving.
A NEW SIGHTING FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It 's barely memory and I can't recall all the details. I have briefly looked after feeling unsatisfied with the incident, but to the best of my recollection it has disappeared.
