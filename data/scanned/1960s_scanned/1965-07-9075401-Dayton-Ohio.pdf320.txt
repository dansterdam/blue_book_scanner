Australia "Visited" in March
Eight lights, each with long, red, incandescent tails about 20 times the length of the head of the lights, were observed by persons at the Wollongong Observatory in New South Wales on March 3, 1965. Radio stations and newspaper switchboards were jammed with calls from persons claiming they saw the lights over New South Wales. All reports said the sightings were from northeast to southwest at 7:15 and 8 p.m. The Civil Aviation Agency and the Royal Australian Air Force said the lights were in the area where the sightings were made.
The Wollongong Observatory saw the objects directly overhead as they passed their regional weekly meeting at the observatory, according to Director Gordon.
Some of the astronomers theorized the sighting "may have resulted from moving the Australian deep space tracking station," Professor Bart Bok, Director of the Mt. Stromlo Observatory, read a small statement about meteorites to the press.
