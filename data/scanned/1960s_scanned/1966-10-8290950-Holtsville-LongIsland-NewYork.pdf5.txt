The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

My eyes did not discredit what they observed,
that orb, moving over to another position, was real.
I gazed a few moments that my eyes might confirm what
they saw to make certain not to be deceived. and it moved
and as it moved further and further away, its size
decreased until it went entirely out of sight.
Well, it was a strange thing, but I have no reason to
doubt the evidence of my senses which beheld it. If
it weren't so, I would not bother to report it. I just
wanted to be sure I was seeing it right, and was
not the victim of some optical illusion or hallucination.
I know it may seem fantastic, but on the spot, it was
there, and I could not have been mistaken about it.
