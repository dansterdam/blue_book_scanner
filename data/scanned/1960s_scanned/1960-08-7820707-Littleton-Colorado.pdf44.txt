PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
CONCLUSIONS
During the past 20 years, a total of 12,618 reports of unidentified flying objects have been received by the Air
Force. Of this total, 11,917 have been analyzed and either identified or are considered to require no further analysis.
The remaining 701 reports are considered to be "unidentified".

The percentage of reports considered to be "unidentified" has steadily decreased from about 25% in 1952
to about 6% at the present time.

The evidence contained in the reports indicates that most UFO sightings can be explained as misidentifications
of known objects or phenomena. However, a few cases remain which cannot be explained as such. These
cases tend to have unusual characteristics, such as high speed, unusual maneuvers, and lack of sound,

Although a few reports seem to defy explanation, extensive studies indicate that these cases do not provide
evidence of visitors from other planets. There is no convincing evidence that unidentified flying objects are
extraterrestrial vehicles.

Based on the factors of speed, flight path, appearance, and lack of sound, a few cases have been classified
as "unidentified". The lack of physical evidence or data precludes satisfactory explanation of these cases.

The Project BLUE BOOK staff has carefully reviewed all the unidentified cases, and further analysis is not
considered likely to provide positive identification.

The Air Force does not have any evidence indicating that the objects classified as "unidentified" represent
technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientific knowledge.

There is no evidence that the unidentified flying objects constitute a security threat to the United States.
