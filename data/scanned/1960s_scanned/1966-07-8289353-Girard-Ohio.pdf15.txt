Exhaust was silhouetted against the sky. Big bell shaped around and a dark streak through the center. Perfect silhouette of the sky. One penny would cover it.
One thinking it takes a larger object to cover it when it gets high in the sky you don't need anything so big.
There was this white with a dark streak. Pretty sure same size. Can compare it with the moon. Looking straight East and can see it was a light spot coming from the sky and steadily coming closer.
Object passed in back of a street light. Then I could see what I could see the body shape then. It was at 30 deg first then at 60 deg. No sound. Maybe if it was closer I would have heard a noise. That distance would have made a noise. No sound on this. Strange when it came directly in front of it a 45 deg the exhaust was a light switch. Then when it came back on 5 seconds later it was someone had turned on a light switch. No change in the speed. Viewed I had watch on but I was so awe struck didn't have time to look at my watch. I retimed it later. Object didn't disappear. It just blotted it off. From what I could see that I didn't move, seemed to have moved very rapidly. Estimated 3000mph. Went considerably slower than a jet. Similar to a prop slow and low. I feel that the 1000 ft alt is about 50% accurate. Not possibly 2000 ft alt. Everything was so plain. Don't think it was anything like a plane.
