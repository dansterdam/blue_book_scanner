Dear Colonel de Jonckheere:

Reference is made to your letter dated June 17, 1966, subject:
UFO Sighting, 25 April 1966, Baltimore, Maryland.

As called to my attention on 26 April 1966, a controller at this facility reported "a bright greenish-white fire ball with a orange tail" observed north of the airport descending."  This was also reported in local newspaper stories indicated that it was identified as a "Comet" by the United States Weather Bureau.  

No other unusual objects were reported.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
