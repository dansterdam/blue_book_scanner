Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio
Gentlemen:

I am enclosing five reports of sightings of UFO's, the first of which I reported by telephone to a Lt. Dutton of the Laredo AFB Force Base, Texas, and gave him information that I would be contacted by Washington. I have continued to make some more observations.  Today I called the Laredo Base and was told that Lt. Dutton had been transferred out, and a Captain Ellis suggested that I write to you direct with my reports.

I am very much interested in knowing what it is that I am seeing, if at all possible, and I would appreciate a reply from your good offices after evaluation of my reports.

Thank you for your attention.

Yours very truly,
Encls.
