Dear Sir:

This will acknowledge your letter of March 8, 1965, received in this office on March 15, 1965, in regard to your letter of February 1, 1965, concerning an unidentified flying object, reported on the night of February 1, 1965, in the Tallahassee, Tallahassee area.

We have contacted the crew of our flight (2H) and they state they were not cognizant of any such flying object. EAL trip 2H continues to be an unidentified flying object.

It is our belief that you must have been given the wrong EAL trip. 

I am sorry we were unable to help in this instance. If there is anything further we can do, please advise.

Very truly yours,
EASTERN AIR LINES, INC.
