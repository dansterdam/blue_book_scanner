The steady stream of reports has been the cause of concern to the Air Force and detailed investigations have been made to discover the stimuli that give rise to such reports. The Air Force objectives have been to determine (1) whether the reported UFO's constituted a threat to the nation, (2) whether the phenomena had any intrinsic scientific value, and(3) the role UFO's may play as a factor in the sky surveillance program. It has been concluded over the many years of UFO investigations that: (1) the phenomena bore no hostile purport and did not constitute a threat; (2) there was no compelling reason to believe that the great majority of sightings arose from anything other than misidentification of natural objects and phenomena, and that the real cause of these sightings generally lies in the conditions under which an object or phenomenon is seen; and (3) the continued evaluation of UFO reports is of scientific value and, especially, necessary in the evaluation of the military sky surveillance problem.

It has been established that many sightings have arisen from the viewing of frequently starting natural objects for the first time, e.g., of very bright meteors, high altitude scientific balloons (which when caught in the jet stream can attain high velocity), flocks of migrating birds, and especially distant aircraft.
