1. An officer recently reporting into this base, Capt Frederic J. Kruzel, has called my attention to the sighting and photographing of a UFO in Roswell, New Mexico. The photographs taken in Roswell with a 35 mm Japanese built camera snapping pictures of flights of birds when he saw a UFO and photographed it. This was shortly before the recent flurry of sightings in the Rio Grande valley a few hundred miles east of Roswell.

2. Capt Kruzel saw the picture which appeared to be a metallic object suspended but he did not interrogate the photographer about associated sounds, apparent speed, estimation of size, or other particulars because he did not wish to plant any ideas in the photographer's mind. Capt Kruzel plans to secure copies of this transparency. If the UFO office is interested in following up on this matter, I will be happy to send them the copies of the print when we are able to secure them and put them in touch with Capt Kruzel.
