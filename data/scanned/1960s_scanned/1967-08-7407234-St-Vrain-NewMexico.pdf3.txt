35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: This is an OBJECT 10 MILES WEST OF CANNON AFB GLOWS SHINY OBJECT FIRST SEEN, OBSERVED FOR ABOUT A MINUTE THEN STOPPED AND PASSED STREAM. LIGHT BEHIND CAR STILL STREAMING AHEAD. 3 PARKS AND FIRE DEPT WERE THERE, BUT THEY DID NOT BURN UP AS WE WATCHED. THESE FIRE BALLS HAD TO PASS AHEAD OF THEM, AND GO ON THE GROUND, THEN PARALLEL, AS IT MADE A TURN. IT WENT HORIZONTALLY FOR ABOUT A MINUTE, THEN ANOTHER TURN, 7 AND AS WE WATCHED, IT AND FINALLY FADED TO A FAINT GLOW. TOOK ABOUT THE TIME AS WE USE TO CHECK AND WHEN I'VE SEEN THEM BEFORE THE OBJECT WAS MY COLOR BRIGHTER. WE WATCHED IT UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS. THIS WAS MY OWN OPINION, BUT IT'S NOT BEEN PROVED.
