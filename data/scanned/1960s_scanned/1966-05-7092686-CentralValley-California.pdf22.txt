On Monday evening at the 24th of May 1966 at 8:30 p.m. - Patricia Strapponni and I, Annette M. Strapponni, went to the home of Patricia's dad, Helgio E. Zampini, in the hopes of seeing anything unusual we might see in the sky. We are done this before, because many same things seem to happen and some unusual night events occur before sunrise. The night was clear, and the stars were visible, and there were clouds, but the stars were visible directly overhead. Looking toward a south-easterly direction, we could see a bright red star-like object hovering about 3120 feet in the sky. We saw this about 120 minutes.

I also have several pictures that were taken in May of 1966. These were given to me.
