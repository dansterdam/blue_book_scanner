The image shared does not contain any photograph, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now proceed to transcribe the text found in the document.

The text reads:

"The object appeared circular in shape, bright red in color, and appeared to be approximately 20-30 feet in diameter. It was observed to be hovering at an altitude of approximately 50-75 feet above the ground for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and rapidly disappearing from view in an easterly direction. No sound was detected during the observation. The object was observed by four independent witnesses - two police officers and two private citizens. The report states that the observers were extremely reliable and credible. This appears to be a legitimate sighting of an unidentified flying object."
