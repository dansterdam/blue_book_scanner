There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old document, likely an official UFO report, from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I can extract the following text from the document:

IT, I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE SKY ALONE .

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT, ALMOST THERE,

B. WAS THE PHENOMENON MOVING BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
THESE APPEAR TO BE MOVING INTO OR OUT OF SIGHT BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED.
