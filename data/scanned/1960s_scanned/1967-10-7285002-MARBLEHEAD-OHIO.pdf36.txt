Gentlemen:

In regard to your letter of December 19, 1967, please be advised that our department had no report of saucers or blimps on December 20 or 21, 1967.

At that time the local papers carried a story that Mr. Warren Bogart's 700's, they shore road, Marblehead, Ohio, had sighted unusual objects in the area.

We are not aware whether planes or blimps were in the area at the stated time, although the local airport is only 8 miles west of the Bogart home.

Sincerely yours,
Joseph L. Long
Village Marshal
