Being a bicyclist, it is only natural that I travel with such traffic conditions from the rear, as well as oncoming aircraft in front of me. While riding in heavy traffic, I became suddenly aware of an object in the sky, which, though slightly obscured by trees, appeared to be a 5" reflective telescope. I studied the object in some detail and noted that it appeared to be a bright, metal, disc-shaped object and continued to observe it for about 100* of an arc as I was looking. Information given in the questionnaire, it seems, does not accurately reflect the situation that occurred, there being no temporary low level check made, and no report of abrupt landing, which never occurred. From observations that have been trying to estimate the dimensions of the object to have been about 35 feet across, at a highest point, with a series of bands, concentric in form, moving in a rotational manner, and being the first day of March, and that the vision of this object terminated, and a temporary loss of consciousness occurred, which may have delayed visions, and a temporary low level check had to be made.
