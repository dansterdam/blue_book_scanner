Dear traveler, to your request on reported UFO sighting, I regret that I cannot give you additional informaction, since I never saw it or took a photo. The time I was expected to see it, I did not. The object you mentioned as having been seen by others is one which I never got any details on. I am sorry I cannot give you any more than this, but I trust that you will understand that these matters can be most difficult to properly evaluate and still not be able to give you much more to go on. Sincerely yours
