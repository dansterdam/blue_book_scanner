CRAFT REPORT 7/16/68

THAT NIGHT I SAW A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY THAT HOVERED OVER OUR HOME FOR QUITE SOME TIME.  IT WAS FIRST SEEN AT ABOUT 10:45 PM AND REMAINED THERE FOR NEARLY 15 MINUTES. THERE WERE NO BLINKING LIGHTS, JUST A VERY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO BE SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR. IT FINALLY STARTED TO MOVE AWAY FROM US VERY SLOWLY AND SILENTLY, UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE AND IT HAS LEFT ME QUITE SHAKEN. I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE IN THE AREA REPORTED A SIMILAR SIGHTING THAT EVENING.
