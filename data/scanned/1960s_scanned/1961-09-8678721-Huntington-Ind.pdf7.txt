Dear Sir:
Several nights I have been observing the sky. I have seen a moving object. Could you please tell me what it may be? It shines about like Echo, it also appears in the west about the same place, one would see Echo in the low North I believe you call it, but then instead of going across the sky into the east, it travels south, at the same time every other night approximately 9:05 sighting and out of sight at 9:16 the time differential convinces me it is not Echo, the change of travel also does not line up. What is it?

Thanking you for your time
Mrs. [redacted]
Huntington, Ind.

I do miss seeing Echo. Can you give me a time to look, and is the 20 some odd minutes before or after for the next night sighting?
