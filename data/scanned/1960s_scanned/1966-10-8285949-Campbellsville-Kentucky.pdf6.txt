Dear Sirs:

On the occasion of my first letter of the 18th of October, I wrote once again while in reply to your request for further information on the 15th of October object of reference on the 15th of October.

In your letter you asked me to check the direction of the object, when first sighted between 8 and 9 o'clock. I shall little attention to it, and have more or less observed the night sky. It took almost 15 or even 10 minutes to cross the sky and disappear. It was a steady glow, as a stated, and moved from the northwest to the southeast.

I feel following almost the same direction as the same direction as the one I saw on the evening of October 15. Thank you.

Sincerely yours,
