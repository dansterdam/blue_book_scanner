The object did not appear to be tilted at any angle, but rather parallel to the ground. The whole object seemed to emit a bluish-yellow glow, brighter than the rest of the scene. It was larger than the four triangles in the center, which were themselves larger than the two brighter "spots" which seemed to be emitting a pale glow.
The object seemed to be only several feet above the ground. The observer reports that it hovered about ten minutes, then moved off rapidly. The object seemed to reassure itself to only move upward at the last. The previously mentioned moving cloud layer did it, but those on the nights afterwards did not.
If it was a natural object, like a fantastic cloud, it should have been recognizable as such. However, it did not seem to be anything in that class. The observer says he knows the object, I am saying that they are not mistaken. I have been seeing a telescope for over ten years, and I know both by day and night what's normal and what's not. I do not think this was just some ordinary electrical condition in the atmosphere, because things like that are much more everyday and obvious, this was not. Nor would it have been some trick of the stars, because the border of the night sky, as seen from my position, would not have been changed.
The object seemed to emit an intense light, enough to make one's eyes blink-I could not look at it for very long. There was also the anti-sugar crowd can think up do not that think that this same object may have also been some sort of flying craft, rather than just a natural phenomenon. The way it moved and the bright light it gave off seems evidence that it was some kind of powered vehicle. However, I cannot be certain of this, as I do not have any special knowledge in this area. I am merely describing what I saw that night to the best of my ability.
