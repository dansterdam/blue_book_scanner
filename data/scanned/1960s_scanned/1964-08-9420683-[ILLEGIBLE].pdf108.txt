The image does not contain any photographs, only text. I will proceed to OCR (Optical Character Recognition) the text on the page:

Lynn, Massachusetts, 10-20pm EDT, 22 August 1964 - No mention of whether the object was sighted by the observer or observers. No description of the object.

At 10:20 p.m., the witness observed what he described as a lighted object which appeared to fly or float out of sight at a fairly low altitude. The object was said to be half the size of the full moon and emitted a white light. The witness said it flew erratically and then apparently landed out of sight beyond a hill. This was not accompanied by any sound.

Special Evidence of Interest - Such statements or observations are called "special evidence" when they indicate a definite link to the investigation. In more than 2000 cases the Air Force has found no evidence to indicate that unidentified objects are sophisticated instruments of hostile origin. The great majority of cases are attributable to misinterpretation of natural phenomena or objects.

That both sightings could not have been caused by an aircraft.
