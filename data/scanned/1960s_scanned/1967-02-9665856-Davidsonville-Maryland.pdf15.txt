The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report, describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text of the document is as follows:

5. The observer stated that the object was judged to have been 1¼ to 1½ miles away from him at the time of the sighting. He was first attracted to the object when he noticed it move.

6. Continued: The observer further stated that he owns an occupied - occupation: radar technician - optical equipment for research and radio circuits.

7. Educational: It is stated that he graduated in 1956 from the Ft. Lewis High School in Cumberland, Maryland. He has no formal training of a scientific nature.

8. Background: It is commented: He stated that he has been interested in and had knowledge of the subject for approximately fifteen years. His knowledge of the subject was obtained on his own initiative. He stated that he had transmitted photographs and other sightings to the NATIONAL SECURITY JOURNAL ON UNEXPLAINED AEIRAL PHENOMENON, IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

9. It is stated that he received a general discharge from the Air Force after one year and three months. He was a Radar Operations Specialist at Lowry AFB, Colorado. His highest enlisted grade was SSGT. His AFSC was 21130. He was separated because it was stated he was "washed" by a first sergeant who is now in a mental hospital. He stated that he has been fighting for his discharge at this point but he has no hope of ever having the discharge changed.

10. The fact that he was not able to explain was that he had a 35 millimeter camera with him and had attempted to take a picture of the object but he could not make the equipment work and as a result he did not take a picture.
