Grace Notes by G.S.H.
Was it a bird or a plane, or some unusual flying object?
The report received does not say what it was that was seen disappearing over the horizon. It was probably some sort of natural phenomena or some plane or other craft. The last said he was going back to Evansville, Indiana so we hope he has looked into it further.
