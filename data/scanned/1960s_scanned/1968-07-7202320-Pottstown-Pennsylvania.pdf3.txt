OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

August 21, 1968

Dear Hector:

Reference the August 2, 1968, letter to you from Mr. Pattori of POTTSTOWN (Pennsylvania) MERCURY (copy attached). What was the nature of the "unusual noise treatment" he received from McGUIRE AIR FORCE BASE?

Would appreciate a rundown as to whom he contacted, when, and what happened. If an official Air Force apology is called for, we will take action to have one made. We would first, however, have to have a few more details of what transpired before responding to Mr. Pattori's August 2 letter.

Sincerely,
