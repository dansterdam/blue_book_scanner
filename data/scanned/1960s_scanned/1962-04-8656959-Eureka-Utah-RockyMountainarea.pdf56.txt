UFO SIGHTING, LYNNDYL, UTAH
19 April 1962

This is a recording concerning an unidentified flying object, sighted on 19 April 1962 at 5:00 hours in Lynndyl, Utah.

For the purpose of the recording, would you give your full name and address?

And could I have your age and occupation, sir? And a certain description of the object. Could you describe what you saw in connection with it? My age is 31 and I am a farmer, 3rd of December, and last...

With regard to the shape of the object you saw last evening, would you describe more or less a tight (?) form, maybe a little wider than round, but it seemed to all be on fire. 

This, with regard to the size, would compare it to about the size of a basketball or smaller? Now, smaller, the size of a baseball, or what? Well, I believe it was a little larger than that, but due to the flightiness and its swiftness, I couldn't tell exactly.

What was the color of the object? It looked a little blue in the white, and that's about what it looked like, more or less, burning metal. But it was so hot.

And there was only the one object? Yes, this one object.

Were there any discernible features? Not that I could see.

Was there any trail or vapor trail behind it, such as you would see on some aircraft contrails? And what was the duration? I imagine that it would be about 500 feet and approximately that it could have been a little longer, if it could have been, if it wasn't causing the heat, the heat passed through and left the flame. Then it wasn't out and it was a smooth trail.
