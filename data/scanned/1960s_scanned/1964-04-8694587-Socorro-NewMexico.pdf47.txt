Gentlemen:

This is to confirm our recent telephone conversation with regard to your letter of May 20, 1964 in which you ask for information relative to our experience in this particular field. We believe a review of the enclosed booklets will indicate to you that we do have considerable background in this field.

We have submitted proposals to the Martin Company, Baltimore, Maryland, and also Grumman in Bethpage, Long Island. These were classified proposals, details of which are possibly available to you at Wright Field.

Our Instrumentation and Control Division in Grand Rapids received a contract (AF 33(615) 972) several years ago covering a study of "Vehicle Departure and Alignment Concepts". Again, we may we suggest that the complete file on this subject is available to you at Wright Field. For your convenient reference, we attach copies of reports 1, 3, 4, 5, 14, and 15 covering this particular study. These are probably the most graphic reports submitted against the contract, and will serve to show you the numerous areas of study.

Our National Water Lift Division in Kalamazoo, Michigan, produced the landing gear assembly for the "surveyor" project. A copy of a single page brochure on this topic is enclosed.
