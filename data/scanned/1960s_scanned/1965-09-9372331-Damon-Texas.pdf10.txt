DAMON, TEXAS
9 SEPTEMBER 1965
On 9 September 1965, an Air Force Report of Investigation was filed from Damon, Texas. The report states that at approximately 1030 hours, the witness observed a silver-colored object hovering approximately 35 feet above the ground in a field adjacent to Highway 6, about 4 miles south of Damon, Texas.
The object was reported to be round or disc-shaped, approximately 30 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately 1-2 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.
The witness was a male civilian, age 52, who was traveling northbound on Highway 6 when he observed the object. No other witnesses were reported.
The investigating officer concluded that the object was most likely an aircraft, and the case was classified as "Insufficient Information" due to lack of physical evidence or corroborating witnesses.
