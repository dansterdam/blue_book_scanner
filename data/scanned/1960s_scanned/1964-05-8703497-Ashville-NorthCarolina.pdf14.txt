I, a student at Asheville School For Boys, in Asheville, N.C., being of sound mind and body hereby testify that on the morning of Tuesday, May 19, 1964, at approximately 8:30 A.M., I observed a strange object in the sky over this school. U.F.O. with the following description: This is to the best of my memory: that this is not a dream or a figment of my imagination and that THIS IS A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THE HAPPENINGS to the best of my memory. The only possible deviating factors are as follows: motion of object quasi-rotational, disappeared from view while in slow motion, vertical ascent. I hereby testify to this report.
