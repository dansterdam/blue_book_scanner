The provided image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a blank page with some instructional text at the top and a handwritten note at the bottom that says "N/A - UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH".

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

IS A DRAWING THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON, INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAIL THAT MIGHT GIVE CLUE AS TO SIZE, SPEED, ALTITUDE, AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT INDICATED.

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE APPARENT SIZE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE MATCH HEAD THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE COVERED.
