I have seen several flights of UFOs over a period of time in the evening sky. They appear to be spherical in shape and of a bright white light. They are similar in appearance to the satellites but move much faster and change direction abruptly. I have seen them on several occasions and reported them to the Air Force but have received no explanation for what I have seen.
