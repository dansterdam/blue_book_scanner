Dear Sir,
On August 28 1966 at about 8:25 p.m. the writer observed an unidentified aerial object over Kettering, Ohio. The object first appeared to be hovering at about 2000 ft altitude and then moved off rapidly to the southwest. The object appeared to be round or elliptical in shape and emitted a bright orange glow. As the object moved away it appeared to change color from orange to white. The duration of the sighting was approximately 3-5 minutes.
(1) Yellowish-orange was the color
(2) lighted the side of a tree in a field 
(3) Bright the size of a star in the sky on a clear night
(4) Descended: one
(5) Unmentionable features: Blinking
