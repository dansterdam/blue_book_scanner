THE PHENOMEN' >N RAPIDLY SHIFTED FROM POINT TO POINT, INDICATING THAT IT APPEARED TO BE OF A SOLID OR SEMI-SOLID NATURE . IT WAS SAID TO BE "TRANSPARENT" WHETHER THIS MEANS IT WAS SEE- THROUGH OR MERELY BRIGHT AND TRANSLUCENT IS NOT CLEAR. IT HAD A SORT OF RAGGED OUTLINE, INDICATING IT WAS NOT A SMOOTH, REGULAR OBJECT LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR SATELLITE.

THE PHENOMENON HAD A LIGHT THAT SEEMED BRIGHT TO THE OBSERVER AND IN FACT THE OBSERVER STATED IT WAS ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST OBJECTS HE HAD EVER SEEN. IN SPITE OF THE BRIGHTNESS, IT DID NOT SEEM TO DAZZLE OR HURT THE OBSERVER'S EYES AS ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHT SOURCE CLOSE TO THE EARTH. IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 1/2 MILE AWAY AND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL AIRPLANE.

IT MOVED ABOUT RAPIDLY, CHANGING DIRECTIONS AND ALTITUDE SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE SIGHTING, WHICH LASTED ABOUT 15 MINUTES. AT ONE POINT IT APPEARED TO EXTEND A FEELER OR TENTACLE -LIKE PROJECTION FROM ONE SIDE, WHICH SLOWLY RETRACTED. IT GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF HAVING PROBES OR ANTENNAE. THE PHENOMENON FINALLY SEEMED TO FADE OUT, GRADUALLY LOSING LUMINOSITY UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED ON THE HORIZON.
