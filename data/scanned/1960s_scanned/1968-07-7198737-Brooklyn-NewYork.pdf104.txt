The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten text on lined paper.

The text reads as follows:

"Thank you for your letter. I hope this clears up the question about a UFO I reported on July 7, 1968 in Brooklyn, New York. The object I saw was oval shaped, silver in color and about 40 or 50 feet in diameter. It moved very slowly and silently at a low altitude. After about 10 minutes it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. I realize that my report may have been a misidentification, but I am quite sure of what I saw that evening. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thank you for your consideration."
