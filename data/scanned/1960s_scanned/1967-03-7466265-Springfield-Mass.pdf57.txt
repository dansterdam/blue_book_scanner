The image contains a diagram that appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report. The diagram shows a sketch that illustrates the motion of an unidentified object or objects. There are instructions and questions below the diagram, but no photograph is present in this particular page.

27. In the following sketch, assume that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "C" on the compass shown to show the direction from which the object came. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
