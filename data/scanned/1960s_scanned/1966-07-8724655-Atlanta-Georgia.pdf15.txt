The image appears to contain a photograph depicting an unidentified flying object (UFO) or other aerial phenomenon. The text describes observations made by an "Electronics Maintenance Technician" of multiple objects moving at a high rate of speed on two separate occasions in July 1966. The objects were observed through binoculars and were not identified as aircraft within the observer's conception. The text also mentions that on a later date, a larger group of the same objects was observed.

On July 25, 1966 at approximately 0845 GMT I, with others, observed two very bright lights skyward flight. They appeared to be stationary, then one left in a northwesterly direction at a high rate of speed. The other proceeded in a northerly direction at a slower speed.
At approximately 0922 GMT an object appeared in the northeast approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. It was observed for some time and was believed to be a single object having various colored reflections which varied considerably at times.
On July 26, 1966 at approximately 0825 GMT while looking one unidentified flying object through binoculars, it appeared to separate itself and an object appeared too large to be a bird or aircraft. I noted no sound from any of these objects.
These objects were not aircraft within my conception of presently operating aircraft.
On July 27, 1966 some of the same objects appeared but quite a large group of 7, 8, and 10 and some middle personnel were observing. We avoided interfering.
