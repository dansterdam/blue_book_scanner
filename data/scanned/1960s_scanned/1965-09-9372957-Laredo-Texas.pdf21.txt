The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed report document from Project Blue Book, describing a sighting of a single amber-colored object by Emilio Dodier Jr. in Laredo, Texas on September 6, 1965. The report details the observer's description of the object and his personal experience of feeling a sense of mental telepathy while watching it.

Report #2.

September 6, 1965. 9:00 PM. E. Dodier alone.
One (1) single Amber colored object really streaking from directly
West to East. Seen with 7x35 field glass for about 5 seconds, then
the light went out. Speed was many times faster than any satellite
that I have ever seen. (I had the peculiar feeling that perhaps by
mental telepathy this particular object sensed I was watching it.)

Report #2.
