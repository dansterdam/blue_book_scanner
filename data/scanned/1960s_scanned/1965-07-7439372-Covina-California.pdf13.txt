I wonder this might would appear strange just at first glance I felt, that someone is calling out to me around 9:00.

When can I make an account of this incident. Yesterday afternoon three youngsters riding bicycles saw a large metallike object hovering at treetop level but a few blocks away. It seemed to go faster at the sight of them. This long place I forgot, it lasted a moie than a minute or so.

I must admit that a cold chills went up on me and I gripped it Didn't know what to think at first but then I decided call the O.R.Y.U. (local unit?). I missed them by may be 5-10 mins, they had checked and left according info from neighbors or so.

Respectfully, I remain, (Signature)
