Dear Captain Foequss:

For your request for additional information: I am herewith enclosing in duplicate copies of statements of my neighbor, as requested by you stating my contact with the first request came in when my neighbor was out on vacation and was not at home due to her illness.

As you requested, we each described our own observations, in our words, without discussing the nature of the incident. We wish to cooperate fully with your official investigation of the enclosed statements.

Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to call upon us.

I would also like to compliment the Air Force and you Captain Foequss, for your prompt and courteous attention to our telephone inquiry, as well as your immediate investigation.

Please be assured that your personal attention to our inquiry was sincerely appreciated by all the members of the family.

Sincerely yours,
(Mrs. [redacted])
