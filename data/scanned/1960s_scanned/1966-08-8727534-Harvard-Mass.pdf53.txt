On sept 18 1966 at approx 830 pm I was driving home from downtown minneapolis and saw a hovering craft with red and green lights. It moved from south to north approx 200 feet in altitude. It was about 100 feet in diameter and had a curved shape to it. It moved at a tremendous speed and disappeared. I have never seen anything like it before or since. I am a registered nurse and am interested in all phenomenon concerning ufos since this sighting.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
