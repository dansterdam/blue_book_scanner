16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes (No) Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Try in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Size: Oval about 4 ft x 3 ft

18. We know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and see how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protusion, etc. and especially include in fine or heavy lines to show the direction the object was moving.

[The page contains a hand-drawn sketch showing a "red blinking light" and a "white (lit up)" object.]
