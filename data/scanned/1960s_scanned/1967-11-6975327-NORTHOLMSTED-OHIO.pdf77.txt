Dear Major Quintanilla:

Replying to the fourth paragraph of your letter of December 29, regarding an unidentified flying object report north of Lake Erie on Novemher 6, 1967, we have checked our records at this station at 1930 EST on that date.  We know of no sightings in this area which launched any balloons.  You may be interested to learn that the Weather Air Upper Air Station at Flint, Michigan, scheduled to release a radiosonde balloon at the same time as this report, released none here, 1930 EST.

Very truly yours,

/s/ Raymond T. Gillam
Meteorologist in Charge
