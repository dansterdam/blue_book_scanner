The conclusion of civilian UFO Research regarding the three objects seen over Dubuque, Iowa, on March 4, 1950 is as follows:

The greater amount of data tends to show that the objects were three aircraft which were not fully out of the possibility that the objects were military aircraft of unknown origin, purpose, or destination.

Aircraft companies manufacturing jet transports for Civilian and military use in 1950 are on file, and an attempt will be made to determine if any aircraft of this type were in flight in the Dubuque area on March 4, 1950. 

Ability of training flights that could account for the sightings will also be investigated.
