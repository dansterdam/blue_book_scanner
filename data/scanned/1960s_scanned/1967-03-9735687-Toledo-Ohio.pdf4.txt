The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing a sighting of a UFO.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

After a while I ran into the house and picked up about a 25x to 30x power hand telescope and viewed the object through this. 

If the object were to be compared with another object towards the end of the sighting, it would most likely be compared with a hot air balloon as the object seemed to be low in the sky. There was no sound that could accompany a balloon balloon because there were no balloons in the area and there were none. To my knowledge, there are no other aircraft or crafts that could have caused this sighting nor could natural phenomenon.

When the object first saw the it was at about 16 or 17 degrees in a westerly direction. The last we saw of the object it was at about 25 degrees.

The path of the object seemed strange to me because it seemed to be coming straight down, increase greatly in speed and went up and away from the first position. The white light kept getting brighter and brighter instead of dimming out.

There was only one object I could see during the entire sighting.

At the time of the sighting, two other people were with me. They both saw the object at the same time as I did. We all agree that what we saw was most extraordinary. I must say, I believe that I have filtered out the crackpots, for this seems to be a case of pictures of UFOs. I can tell from this and other authentic UFO sightings that I think the phenomena that have been described are both puzzling and true accounts of pictures of phenomena.
