35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

There were 2 bright lights, like stars, but larger. They were slowly moving and seemed to change direction at times. This happened at about 7:30 PM in Feb. 1967 at Little, Missouri. They seemed to be intelligent, guided objects and not normal. I haven't seen anything like them before. I would have said they were aircraft, but they didn't have the usual running lights and their motion was very erratic, going up and down and sideways and so on. I can't really guess what they were, but they were definitely not normal. Wouldn't want to go so far as to say they were spaceships, but they were certainly very strange unexplained objects in the sky. I don't know what they were, but I know they weren't anything I had ever seen before.

If the UFO organization has any information on similar sightings in this area, I would certainly be interested in knowing about it. It would be helpful to know if others have seen things like this and what they might be. There isn't much I can add, except to say that they were most definitely not normal aircraft or phenomena, and that I am really stumped as to what they could have been. I just know that they didn't seem to be of this world, but I don't want to go so far as to say they were spaceships either. They were simply strange unexplained objects in the sky that evening.
