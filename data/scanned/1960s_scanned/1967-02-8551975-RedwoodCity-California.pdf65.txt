There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed letter from the Office of Information, Community Relations Division, addressed to "Dear Mr. _____", and signed by George P. Freeman, Jr. The letter discusses an "unidentified observation" and the ongoing investigation by the Air Force.

Text from the document:

MAY 5 1967

Dear Mr. _____:

This replies to your recent correspondence concerning your unidentified observation. Examination of the data indicates that no positive identification can be made at this time, primarily because of the incomplete characterization, angular velocity, and how the object disappeared.

No other unidentified flying objects reports were submitted to the Air Force from the vicinity of Gleason, Michigan for February 9, 1967.

At this late date a meaningful scientific investigation is not possible. It is important for us to accumulate more specific data from the sighting. This enables Air Force analysis to perform a comprehensive investigation. The same kind of information will be useful to the present study for your observation.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
