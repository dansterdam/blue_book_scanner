The image contains two diagrams. The first diagram is a sketch illustrating how to indicate the position of an object in the sky relative to the horizon. The second diagram appears to be a compass or direction indicator with numbered degrees around the perimeter.

There is no photograph visible in this image.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a sketch to show how they were positioned and give one or two sentences to describe how they varied in position to each other.
