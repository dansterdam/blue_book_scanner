SIGHTING: 27 March 1956, Dayton, Ohio
Miss SD., W-7 AFB, Ohio observed an object on the night of 27 March 1956 at the Dixie Drive-in. Object went N to SW, looked to be high as airplane.
Saw it for just a few minutes. Looked like a star. Observed 11:45 or 12 pm. Looking through the windshield, object went over the screen.
Major Quintanilla said we had a couple of reports for satellites at that time last night (when she observed object). She said it looked like satellites. (It is quite possible that she had her directions off slightly).
