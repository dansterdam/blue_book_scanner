Dear Mrs.

MAJOR Quintanilla has asked that I reply to your letter concerning the UFO observation in September 1965.
Your kind letter is appreciated and I definitely feel you must have observed something most unusual. The only thing that comes to mind would be an artificial cloud release that occurred on September 30, 1965, at Kings Valley, Virginia. A recent check of our files indicates altitudes of 30 and 570 statute miles, there were two enormous cloud columns seen that were seen and reported by an unidentified number of observers on the eastern sky; however, I am doubtful that this was what you observed. Another possibility is a static discharge.
But this also is just a guess.
Your information will be kept on file which adds to our data base. The late date would not permit a detailed investigation at this time. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Office of Information.

Sincerely,

GEORGE D. FREEMAN, JR.
