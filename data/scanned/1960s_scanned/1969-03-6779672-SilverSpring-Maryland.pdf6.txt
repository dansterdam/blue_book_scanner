The image appears to contain two sketches or drawings, but no photographs.

The first sketch is a compass rose diagram showing different directional labels. The text above it states "HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. ALSO PLACE A '+' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED."

The second sketch shows two landscape views, one larger and one smaller, both depicting a person or figure standing on a road or path surrounded by hills or mountains.
