There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

6. Results:

It is expected that the university findings, resulting from investigations of certain unidentified flying objects, may indicate that the USAF UFO program as at present is to increase the efforts, or to decrease the efforts, and also to determine the credibility of the findings.

It is hoped that better public understanding will result in investigations of the several problems that a scientific investigation may make a spectacular, but difficult to estimate, out of this investigation which can produce a great wave of public interest and confidence in the program.

c. It is possible that there exist some phenomena that may be of interest for investigation by current university or government research organizations and that a better understanding of these phenomena should not be neglected in the investigation of the UFO problem.
