Ravenna Police Department
Ravenna, Ohio

Dear Chief Buchert,

The most probable cause of the object which you were trying to photograph was the planet Venus and this was the reason that you were unable to photograph it with your camera. In order to have been able to photograph it with your camera, you would have had to photograph it with a long exposure. This cannot be done with the type of camera you were using.

Thank you for your cooperation and your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
