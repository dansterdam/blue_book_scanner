The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text that has been redacted or obscured.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the unredacted text found in the document:

I responded to an optical siting of an unidentified aerial object in the sky over Auburn, New York on August 7, 1965. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes, beginning at about 9:45 PM EDT. The object was reported to be round or oval in shape, with flashing lights around the perimeter, and appeared to be controlled and directed in its movements. The object was observed at low altitude, approximately 1000 to 1500 feet. The object appeared to change direction abruptly, move in a zig-zag fashion, and at times, appeared to hover. Several other residents of Auburn reported observing the same object at the same time. I was unable to identify the object.
