OCRED TEXT:

DOCTOR: Did they make any sexual advances to you?
BETTY: No. . . . I asked the leader, I said: Why did they put that needle into my navel? And he said it was a pregnancy test. I said I don't know what they expected, but that was no pregnancy test. And he didn't say any more.
DOCTOR: All right. We'll stop here now.

The BETTY returned to the office for further questioning on March IS, 1964.

DOCTOR: About this needle. How far in did he inject it?
BETTY: Oh, it was a long needle. I don't know, I thought it didn't go in, but I would say the needle was four inches long, six, maybe. . . . Something like that was attached to it. They didn't leave it in very long. Just for a second.
DOCTOR: What kind of pain was it?
BETTY: All I could think of was a knife. . . Then, I was grateful to the leader for stopping the pain
