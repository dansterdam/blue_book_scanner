3. RADAR VISUAL CASES
a. DAVENPORT, IOWA - MARCH 6, 1968 
On the night of March 6, 1968, at 9:55 p.m. CST, a ground observer at Davenport, Iowa, observed a large, dark, elliptical object with a row of bright lights along the edge. The sighting was reported immediately to the Quad-City Airport in Moline, Illinois. The airport controller stated that his radarscope showed an unknown target in the same area described by the witness. The radar tracking lasted about 12 minutes.

The unknown object remained stationary for a short period, then began moving slowly away at an estimated speed of 75 mph. As the object moved away, the radar blips became weaker and weaker until the object disappeared from the radarscope.

The case is listed as "unidentified" in the Project Blue Book files.
