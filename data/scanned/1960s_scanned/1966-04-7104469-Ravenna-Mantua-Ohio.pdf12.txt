The image does not contain any photographs. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

SUBJECT: UFO (Mantua, Ohio)
ANALYST: Major Quintanilla FT: Lt Benson DATE: 22 Apr 66

1. Both "images" fall into the same frame area.
2. Neither of the images is bright enough against background density 1.25. "Image density" 1.06.
3. If the object was "bright" against a dark sky the images should have density - they are dark.
4. The entire roll of film is severely fogged which could cover up density of the images.
5. The marks in the framing area of the film are outside the field of the lens, therefore they could not be images.
6. UFO's are probably processing defects due to old fogged film and handling.
