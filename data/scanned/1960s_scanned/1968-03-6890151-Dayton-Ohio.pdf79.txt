The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with a form-like structure containing various categories for the observer to fill out, such as "eyeglasses", "windshield", "side window of vehicle", and so on. The bottom of the form has a section for the observer to describe the phenomenon observed.
