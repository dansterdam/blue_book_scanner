Boy Fined '$50 In Spaceship Hoax in N.J.

By The Associated Press
GLASSBORO, N.J. - A 16-year-old youth was fined $50 Thursday for perpetrating a hoax last weekend in which he claimed a spaceship had landed in a field.
The youth, whose name was withheld, pleaded guilty to making false reports of an emergency. He was fined in Glassboro Municipal Court.
The boy told authorities that at 1:30 a.m. last Saturday he had seen a spaceship land in a field near the Rowan School of Technology here. He said the craft was about 40 feet in diameter and had green, yellow and red lights.
After an intensive search, police determined the report was a hoax. The youth later admitted he had made up the story.
Working as a delivery boy for a newspaper, the youth saw the lights of a truck being loaded and mistook them for a spaceship, authorities said.
The police chief said the youth's stunt caused "quite a disturbance" and that he had to call in extra patrolmen to handle the situation.
