Dear Major Quintanella,

After trying in vain to find an explanation to this photograph I am sending a print of the slide to you. I hope you will be able to explain it as I am a member of the Professional Photographers of America and the National Press Photographers Association, I was recently employed as an intelligence analyst. 

DATA: Object was flying west to east, camera was looking east-south-east, as object was going from right to left in the frame, and was photographed after it reached the far left side of frame. It was quite high flying, fast, and made no con trails. No color. The naked eye. The man was behind me. This is not a double exposure. You may keep this print if you like.

Films: Kodachrome Type F 35mm 
Filter: Daylight (color correction)
Lens: (Kodak Pony 1/4.5 camera) 
Dates: June 5, 1960
Time: 1:55 p.m.
Place: Corner of Columbia and Pearl st.,Union City, Indiana.

I personally have given up trying to explain the pattern that developed on the film and hope you can help me.

Thank you.
