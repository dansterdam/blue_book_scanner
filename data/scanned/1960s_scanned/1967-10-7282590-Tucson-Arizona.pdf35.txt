The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a questionnaire or form related to a UFO sighting report. The text on the form asks various questions about the sighting, such as whether the object disappeared, whether it moved in front of a cloud, and asks the witness to describe the sound and color of the object. There is also a drawing area where the witness is instructed to draw a picture showing the shape of the object and the direction it was moving.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind anything at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: A deep, pitching rumble
b. Color: Light silvery, no glare

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

More than very small match.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
