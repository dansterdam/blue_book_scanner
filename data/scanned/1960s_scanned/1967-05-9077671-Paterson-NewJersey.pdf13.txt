Proposed reply to letter from ARC Charles Rogers, 11 May 1967

Dear Airman Rogers:

This replies to your recent correspondence regarding your unidentified observation. At this late date, a meaningful scientific investigation is not possible. It is important for an individual to report his observation to the nearest Air Force installation as soon as possible. 

Your information will be filed for information purposes only. To date, there has been a total lack of tangible evidence to indicate our planet has or is being visited by extraterrestrial vehicles. UFOs do exist; but in reports only.

Thank you for your interest in the Air Force's UFO program.
