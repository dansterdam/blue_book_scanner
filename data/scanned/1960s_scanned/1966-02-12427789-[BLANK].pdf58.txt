Substantial psychological significance. What need is fulfilled by a belief that unidentified flying objects are of extraterrestrial origin? It is noteworthy that in the contact tales, the spacecraft and their crews are never reported to be hostile. It would be very satisfying if a race of advanced and benign creatures were devoted to our welfare. The interest in unidentified flying objects derives, perhaps, not so much from scientific curiosity as from unfulfilled religious needs. Flying saucers serve, for some, to replace the gods that science -- for good or otherwise -- has deposed. The old mythological frameworks have evaporated, but, with their reports of distant and exotic worlds and their pseudo-scientific overlay, the contact accounts are acceptable to many people. These tales, and their attendant ritual, comprise one of the few viable contemporary cult movements of more than passing interest and local relevance. But precisely because people desire so intensely that unidentified flying objects be of benign, intelligent, and extraterrestrial origin, honesty requires that, in evaluating the observations, we accept only the most rigorous logic and the most convincing evidence.
