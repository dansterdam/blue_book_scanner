U.F.O. SIGHTING
I am employed as a night watchman by the E.K. Garage, Casey, Ill. The sighting was made from the company premises.
The object in question came in from the northwest and was a definite brightly lighted object. It appeared to me to turn and proceed due south for a short space of time and then it made a slight turn and headed northwest. In relation to some powerlines and also two bright stars, it was definitely moving. In appear once, the object looked rather small in size. It also appeared to have a wavering side to side motion, and moved at approximately the same speed as a jet aircraft when seen on a clear night, so far as I could tell, was clear as a crystal. Also, there was no sound associated with the object so far as I could hear, and ideas, but to include them, I feel, would not constitute a fair and impartial report.
