Proposed reply to letter from 30 December 1966

Dear _____,

Reference your letter of 30 December 1966 regarding your observation of an alleged flying object over the Denver area. A study of the information which you submitted for your 7 December 1966 observation was undertaken and revealed that you probably observed the star, Sirius. The description, size, brightness, movements, etc. are very consistent with the observation of that particular star. Sirius, with a stellar magnitude of approximately -1.5, is the brightest star visible in the heavens. 

When stars are viewed low on the horizon, the observer is looking through many more miles of the earth's atmosphere than when looking at stars overhead. The earth's atmosphere actually acts as a prism, causing the incoming light to be broken down into the various colors of the spectrum. In technical terms, this phenomena is called scintillation. The closer the stars are to the horizon, the more pronounced this scintillation will be, because we are looking through a thicker layer of atmosphere. This is why stars appear to be twinkling or scintillating most when low on the horizon. The most beautiful scintillation of all is that of the bright star, Sirius, which is visible in the winter months rather low in the sky.

From the information submitted, it does appear that Sirius was observed. The Air Force has received several reports during the months of November and December describing similar observations such as yours.

I hope this is helpful.
