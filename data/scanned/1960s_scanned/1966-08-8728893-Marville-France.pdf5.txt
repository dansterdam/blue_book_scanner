YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK is the largest national park in the United States and lies mainly in northwest Wyoming, extending into Montana and Idaho. It is famous for its geysers, hot springs, and other volcanic features. Nearly two-thirds of all the world's geysers are found in Yellowstone. The park contains about 10,000 thermal features and 200 to 300 active geysers. Other attractions include the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, the Yellowstone Lake, the Old Faithful geyser, and numerous glaciers and wildlife. The park was established in 1872 as the first national park in the world.
