UFO Photographs

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],
The photographs of an unidentified object which you loaned to us have been processed. The negative films were probably caused by a malfunction showing behind the contacts when the shutter was opened in the field of view.

The 3/4" diameter image which appears on the negatives could be taken with a 35mm camera. This image could be that of a daytime object. This image could be that of a balloon or a reflection. It is possible that the company which processed the film altered the image in some way, or that the object was much closer to the camera than you had assumed.

The prints and negatives which you loaned to the Air Force are returned with this letter. The Air Force thanks you for your interest and cooperation in this case.

Sincerely,

[SIGNATURE]
