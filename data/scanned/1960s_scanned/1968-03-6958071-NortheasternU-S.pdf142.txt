Text from the document:

Dear Sir:

I am presently enrolled as a student at Bethany College, Bethany, West Virginia. On approximately 9:30 p.m. Saturday night, as I was returning to my dormitory after leaving the Bethany College campus, I noticed two bright, light-colored objects in the sky traveling at a high rate of speed.

The objects appeared to be one of the others. One appeared to be of greater speed traveling at a greater or lesser speed than the pursuing object. The pursuing object seemed to have emitted two object in rapid succession, and seemed to be closely watching the first object were slower, the fires and the pursuit appear more intense.

The objects were clearly visible, the first object more distant. The pursuance more close and the phenomenon strange. I was standing and observed it for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The objects appeared and disappeared. The wind was calm, sky clear, and the temperature was rather cold.

I would appreciate any information regarding this phenomenon as I am most curious as to the exact nature of the sighting. If possible, please return this letter to me at the above address.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
