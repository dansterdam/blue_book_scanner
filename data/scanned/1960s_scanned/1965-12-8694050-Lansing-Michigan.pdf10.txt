Dear Sir:
John Werge and I saw what I thought was a strange flying object on April 7, 1959. We watched it for some time and it was quite different from any aircraft we had ever seen before. It seemed to be moving along very rapidly, making no sound at all, and had a different shape from any plane or jet we had seen. It had a peculiar glowing light and seemed to change shape or color once or twice. I can't believe it was an airplane, as it was making no noise whatsoever and was moving too swiftly for any known aircraft. My friend thought it was a satellite or some strange new type of rocket, but I don't think that could be the case either. It was much too low and too bright. We watched it for quite some time, and it was a definite object, not a star or any other celestial body.
I was quite puzzled as to what it could be. I would be interested in any information you might have concerning this sighting. I haven't reported it to anyone else, as I didn't know if it was worth bothering about. But if it was something unusual, I think it should be looked into. If you think it was an ordinary occurrence, let me know that too. I would be glad to hear from you.
Yours Truly,
