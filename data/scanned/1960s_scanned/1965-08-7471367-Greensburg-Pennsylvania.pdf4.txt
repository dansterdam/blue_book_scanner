There does not appear to be any photograph present in the image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Mr. - stated he is scientifically baffled, quite certain as an observer he is acquainted with high-flying jets and he says it was not a known type aircraft. Concerning the other sightings, the first sighting was Thursday, August 27th. The sighting was apparently very similar to the sighting of August 13th except that there was no moon. The time was 11:30 P.M. Eastern Daylight Saving Time. The sighting of August 15th was not, as well as the sky. It was observed at about only 20Â° elevation above the western horizon, having come into sight directly in the south and proceeding in a northwesterly direction. With the sound low, this horizon shrouds well have been an aircraft away to be heard. It is harder to apply this interpretation to objects which were seen directly overhead. If we adopt as the apparent angle of value reference to our tables shows that a craft at 10,000 feet would be 250 miles per hour, or at 5 miles, 625 miles per hour. Because the distance of the sight 1 would favor something close to Piper Cub, for instance, 3 to 5,000 feet above him. Of course, he may deny this, but it seems the most logical. A jet would have to be hand, and the brilliance of the light argues against an aircraft. There is the possibility of a captured retrograde natural satellite, there is the unidentified category. Because it appeared as several and did in such case a systematic motion, and this motion is not that of an aircraft, I would tend to disregard the lack of sound this down as possible aircraft. Don't tell this to Mr. - with whom I recently spoke again's haste.
