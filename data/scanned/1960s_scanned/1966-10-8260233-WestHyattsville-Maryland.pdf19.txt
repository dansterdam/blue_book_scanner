The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a handwritten document. The document appears to be an account of an observation of a Canadian National Airlines jet by an observer. The text describes the appearance, behavior, and movement of the object, and notes that it was "not a normal jet" and that the observer could not identify what the object was. There is also an annotation at the bottom of the document that appears to be a signature, but the name has been redacted.

Aug. 19, 1966.

Was seen at the Canadian National Airlines jet which passed by. 
Plane was not approaching normally.

Came for 3 to main:

Those are the motion they were made by the object which were not the natural shapes of the jet.

Maneuver only. Passing the one which.

Not a maneuver
