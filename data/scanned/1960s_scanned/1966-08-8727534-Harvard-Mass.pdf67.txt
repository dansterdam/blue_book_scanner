Here is the text from the document:

I had my attention attracted and I did not immediately see that which I first noticed. It was not a star or a conventional type of light, but a large, slowly moving, hazy object that first looked like a lighted airship or dirigible, but was not either of those. It moved silently and slowly across the sky for some minutes, finally disappearing. I did not have time to get binoculars or a camera, but I am quite certain that what I saw was not any conventional type of aircraft or light. I am a retired Naval officer and astronomer, and while I cannot explain what I saw, I am certain it was not anything of a normal nature. VCAP and Science and Mechanics Magazine might be interested in knowing of this unusual sight. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely,
