Vision, if you know what I mean. It was more or less shining at the front or maybe hood portion of my car rather than in the window itself.
H   I see. How narrow or how wide would you say the beam was?
J   Approximately 5 to 6 feet, the width of the car.
H   And were the edges of the beam sharp or fuzzy? They were very defined, just similar to a flashlight or spotlight beam. 
J   I see, it was certainly interesting. Well, okay, please (Keep interrupting)
H   But please go ahead with your story.
J   Well, at the time, this beam seemed to reach down and touch my car, the engine failed and this was noted first by the oil light indicator coming on inside the car, or the generator light, and I mashed the accelerator and the car did not respond at all and so I put on the brakes. I found stopping and steering the car very difficult, the car having power steering and power brakes.
H   What model car is it, by the way?
J   '67 Ford custom.
H   So you, it is not a car you'd not expect to have difficulties with, I should imagine.
J   No sir, I'd never had any similar difficulties like this before.
H   Now, I'm interested to know that:I would say well over a hundred cases of engine stoppage. I'm trying to track down just the manner in which it .. is it sudden, does it sputter, does it slowly die or what?
J   It seemed to just cut off, as if I had possibly turned it off myself, but I'll explain later why I don't feel that I turned it off myself. When the engine died I stopped the car with the brakes, which was, like I
said, very difficult.
