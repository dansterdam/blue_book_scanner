Dear Sir,

I have just received your letter dated July 12, 1966. It was in replies to my letter of April 29, 1966. As you remember, I wrote to you, mentioning the incident of April 30, or the red object that caused a fire.

The object in question on April 29, 1966 was not moving toward the EE, as was the case in the object I mentioned. It was seen by several very reliable people and it was not moving at all. This would specify the case of April 30, as the one I wrote you about.

Also, the white object that dropped a little red, whatever it was, was certainly not the same as the one I described in my letter. There could be two causes for the fire. It was not a fire started by the object but rather a fire that was very dangerous location, being right across the street from the station. The object just hovered the direct to cause the fire to light up after dropping the red it. It was in a very dangerous location, being right across the street from the station. The object just hovered the direct to cause the fire to light up after dropping the red it. It was in a very dangerous location, being right across the street from the station.

I accept your conclusions on the April 29, 1966 sighting. It was fascinating to watch and certainly beautiful. However I am still deliberating about the other incident and the white shining object that floated down.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
