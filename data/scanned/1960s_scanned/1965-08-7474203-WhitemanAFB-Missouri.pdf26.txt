WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, MISSOURI
UFO SIGHTING
7 AUGUST 1965

On 7 August 1965 at approximately 0130 hours, the Air Force Security Police at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, reported a UFO sighting. The Security Police stated that they observed a bright, round, glowing object approximately 100 feet in diameter hovering just above the tree line to the northwest of the base. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight.

The Commanding Officer at Whiteman AFB was immediately notified of the incident. Air Force radar had detected an unknown object in the vicinity at the time of the sighting, but it had disappeared from the scope before ground visual contact could be made.

No physical evidence of the UFO was found, and the Air Force investigation was closed with a lack of conclusive evidence as to the nature or origin of the object.
