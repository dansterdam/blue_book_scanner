The image does not contain any photographs, but rather consists of a technical drawing and text. The drawing shows a curved line with angles labeled, as well as a compass rose. The text instructs the viewer to imagine a scenario and draw a picture to show the motion of an object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object or objects appeared above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass rose to show the direction from which the object was traveling.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
