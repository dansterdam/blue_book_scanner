TO: Major Mills
Sat-Base, and 2100 Local, I (Verlin D. Denlay, Capt.) received a call on the same Operations Line to check for radar contact (0 route in 2 Dec 16 Jan). At the time Vance ordered to "scramble two T-33s ASAP. I sent aircraft out and advised that I could not confirm anything, due to the radar being out.
