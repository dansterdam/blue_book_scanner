1. Analysis of the movie film reveals nothing of an unusual nature. The film was exposed and the panning was such that it is plausible to assume that a child was taking the pictures. There was an indication of a light being on certain portions of the film. The Air Intelligence Information Report was of no value as the subject of the report could not be remotely resembled the object in question.

2. The 35MM transparency was probably exposed inside of a building and through a glass window. The object in question is probably a reflection on the window from the ceiling. The inside of the shade creates an elliptical shape and the strong white area in the top central portion is the light bulb which reflects the object.
