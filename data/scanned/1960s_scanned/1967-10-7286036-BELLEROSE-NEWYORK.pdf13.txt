GENTLEMEN:

On the evening of October 22, 1967 (Sunday), at approximately 8:00 p.m., I, Yvonne, my sister and mother, and a family friend were looking out of my window. It was looking out of my window that evening that I saw an object with flashing lights. It came from the east and moved across the sky very fast. There was no sound and it moved sideways all the while the lights were visible and flashing. I then called my sister who also saw the object. The UFO moved light again, and it moved in a erraetic manner, not in a straight line. Due to the lateness of the hour, the shape of the UFO was indeterminable. It was quite close to the earth and was silhouetted to the size of a small car in width.

I will try to re-enact the sighting and position.

Expeditional aircraft - however, we will not accept MARSH GAS as an answer of possible solution.

"The flashing lights were not singularly going off and on. There were full lines of white lights that flashed from left to right and ever light would flash in succession of the next." ITEM 21, PARAGRAPH 1.
