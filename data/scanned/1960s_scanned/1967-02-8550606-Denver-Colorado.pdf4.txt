11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer watched a star like object which traveled across the sky in a southwesterly direction at a high rate of speed. It was white in color and appeared to be larger than a star or planet. The object disappeared toward the south. At the height that the observer had estimated for the object, it would be consistent with the passage of the Pageos A satellite.
