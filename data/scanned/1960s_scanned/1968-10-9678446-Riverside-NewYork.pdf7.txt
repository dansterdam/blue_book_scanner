Dear Miss ******,

The pictures and your letter were received yesterday. I am forwarding them to Lieutenant Colonel Quintanilla who is in charge of Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is the name for the project under which the Air Force carries out the investigation of unidentified flying objects.

I am sure that Colonel Quintanilla needs further information, he will contact you directly. Until then, please feel free to call me for any assistance you may desire in connection with the United States Air Force.

Sincerely,

ALAN M. SHOEMAKER, Capt., USAF
Media Operations Division 
N. Y. Office of Information (OSAF)
