DATE: AUGUST 1c, 1961

On Wednesday, August 30, 1961, my friend and I reported a moving object in the sky over Brooklyn, New York. It was about 7:35 P.M. when we first noticed the object. It was a brilliant light, larger and brighter than any star in the night sky. The light was approximately 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon, and was traveling in a straight, level path from southwest to northeast. The light was steady and did not blink or flicker. The object was visible for approximately 4 to 5 minutes before it disappeared from sight, traveling at a very high rate of speed.
