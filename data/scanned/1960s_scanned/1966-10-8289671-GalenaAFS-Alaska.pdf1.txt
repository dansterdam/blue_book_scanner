11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a stationary and a moving object in the southern sky. The object was spherical in shape and the colors noted were changing from red-green-white. Personnel on duty noted a change of color and intensity. Two F-106s were airborne from Galena AFS at 16282Z. They searched the area for 70 minutes with negative results.
The description of the stationary object is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. The moving light could be a satellite.
