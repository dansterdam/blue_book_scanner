76 S. air fire i
Washington D.C.
Dec 12 1940
I spotted a flying object going
North from eerng to where the month
was light. It appeared to be about
1/2 the size of the moon and was making
a very strange motion-- it would go
very fast and then suddenly slow down
to a crawl with a very erratic course.
At times it appeared to be under
controlledflight or it may have be
because of the sharp turns
this object took from North to West.
Sincerely
