There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a series of questions and responses related to a UFO sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The response indicates that the object did disappear, but does not provide further details.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The respondent circled "Yes" to indicate that the object did move behind something.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The respondent circled "No" to indicate that the object did not move in front of something.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Silent
b. Color - Light but color which came there before disappearing

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The response indicates that the object was "bigger than match stick, about the size of a light bulb".

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and extremities or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The respondent has drawn a sketch showing the object's shape and the direction of its movement.
