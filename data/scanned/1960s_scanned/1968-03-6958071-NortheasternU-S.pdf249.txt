MEMO FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 8 March 1968 (1005 hours)

Sewart AFB, Tenn.
AV 852-1500

Talked to Lt Col Fitzhugh. The only report that he has for 3 March 1968 is at 1755 CST. The observers saw a bright light going east. Saw it for several seconds. The observers names:

Sgt T. Bishop
Cpl Carrico Sq.
Duty Phone: 2163
Home Phone: 593-7679

1110 hours Sgt Bishop called back and his sighting was not a definite. Probably saw a satellite going over.

1015 hrs, talked to Nashville Control Tower (Municipal Airport) 244-7783. They had a few calls that they checked to Sewart APS. Bess Operations did not think that it was worth the effort to call base operation at this time.
