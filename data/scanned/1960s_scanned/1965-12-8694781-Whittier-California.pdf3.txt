The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an handwritten document. The text in the document appears to be a detailed account or report describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Transcribed text from the document:

"This was the first sighting we had of the unknown window. A cloud was seen in the distance, which upon closer observation turned out to be a glowing sphere and shaped like a shining window. As it approached, the glow and brightnrss increased. The edges of the window appeared to be illuminated or glowing, with the interior slightly darker. When it was closer, it seemed as if it was emitting a haze or glow around its edges. As it was observed, the window just seemed to hang there in the air, moving very slowly and silently. The whole area was well lighted and easy to see. No sound was heard. The window could have been from 10 to 50 feet in diameter. After being observed for some time, two more similar objects appeared and joined the first one. The three then moved off rapidly toward the northeast and disappeared."
