Transcription of the text in the document:

"From which it has come, and I think it
for certain that it had some connection with the
March air force base that is located in
Syracuse, N.Y.

This object that has had flown by
the police made you noise whatsoever. 
They were hovering, and it was very bright and
went north. Camp Drum, I am used to
the coming and going of the military
planes that city never where. However, since this
thing passed right over town, the police are
very frightened, and it appears that this
is not for a special purpose, and
that special purpose we are to make contact
so they 92 make contact with the U. F. O.
that is said such up with some one.

I don't to state that whatever a clear
day like this, see shining brightly, and
very strange."
