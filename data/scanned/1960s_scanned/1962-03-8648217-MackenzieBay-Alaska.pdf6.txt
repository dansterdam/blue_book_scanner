1. (UNCLASSIFIED) REPORT

2. (UNCLASSIFIED) 1/n

3. GENERAL: (1) A check with USAF RADAR/RADAR and Alaskan RADAR Region disclosed no unusual activity that could account for the sighting. In addition the possibility of reflections from Jet aircraft or ESVS that could account for the sighting in discounted because the Radar operator on duty at the time of the sighting said that the targets observed in addition to the object were not unusual and that the objects observed during the time of the sighting, plus or minus 30 minutes. The Radar operator reports nothing unusual for this period.

(2) A check with SAC/M-21050 and the AFWAG Liaison Officer revealed that on 31/3/62 a flight was made in the Mackenzie Buy area between 35/34 and 37/36 GMT. No unusual activity was observed.

4. COMMENT: We can't identify the object. It appears to have been a brilliant white light or a classified test. Due to the high elevation of the object, any classified test of a new aerial vehicle is believed more likely.

5. (UNCLASSIFIED) This report is classified [REDACTED] because it reveals some classified operational capa- bilities.
