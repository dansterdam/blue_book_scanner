REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

On February 9, 1963, at approximately 6:30 p.m., a law enforcement officer from Maysville, Kentucky, reported sighting an object which he believed to be an unidentified flying object.

The officer stated that while on routine patrol, he observed a bright light in the sky moving in an erratic manner. The object was described as round, with a reddish-orange color and giving off a pulsating glow. It was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter and moving at a high rate of speed, approximately 800-1,000 miles per hour.

The officer watched the object for several minutes as it maneuvered in the sky, making sharp turns and abrupt changes in direction. He reported that the object appeared to hover briefly before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

No other witnesses were identified, and no physical evidence or corroborating reports were obtained. The case was classified as an unidentified flying object by the investigating agency.
