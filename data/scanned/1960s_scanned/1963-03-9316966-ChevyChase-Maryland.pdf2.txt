The Path of the March 13ollde
UNITED STATES ARMY PHOTO 0-S33-OO8
A VERY BRIGHT circular was seen to appear in the sky over Cherwell, Virginia, on March 3, 1953. It was observed from several points in the Middle Atlantic states as it moved from Virginia northward through Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, ending up in the Atlantic Ocean off the New Jersey coast. Eyewitnesses in West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina reported that the object was visible for over two hours as it traversed across the sky.
On the ground, the motion of the object was accompanied by a large whirlwind approximately 50 feet in diameter, which observers said moved rapidly across the ground. Photographs of this whirlwind were obtained.
The object was described as being very bright, and seemed to increase and decrease in brightness at intervals. At times it appeared to be surrounded by a glowing, fiery corona, like the sun when seen through a thin haze. It was reported to be larger than the full moon, but exact estimates of its size are not available. The object was observed in daylight, under clear sky conditions.
The incident was reported to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, which conducted an investigation. The conclusions of the Institute were that the object was an unidentified flying object, and that the whirlwind on the ground was associated with this object in some way.
The background into this incident can be divided into two parts: (1) the observation of the object itself, and (2) the ground phenomena associated with it.
1. The object was large, brilliant, and pronounced, and was observed by many eyewitnesses over a wide area of the Middle Atlantic States. At one point it is reported to have been visible simultaneously from points in West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. It is described as a glowing circular object, and at times it appeared to be surrounded by a fiery corona. The object moved in a northeasterly direction, at times increasing and decreasing in brightness. Its motion through the sky was not jerky or erratic, but smooth and continuous. Estimates of its size ranged from one to three times the diameter of the full moon.
2. The ground phenomena consisted of a large whirlwind approximately 50 feet in diameter, which moved rapidly across the terrain. Photographs of this whirlwind were obtained. The whirlwind was observed in close association with the passage of the object overhead.
Most observers did not estimate the height of the object above the ground. However, a few observers estimated that the object was at an altitude of approximately 2000 feet. The object was visible for over two hours as it traversed across the sky. It is believed that the object traveled a distance of approximately 275 miles, at an average speed of about 125 miles per hour.
The significance of this incident lies in the fact that it represents one of the relatively few cases where an unidentified flying object has been accompanied by an apparent ground disturbance in the form of a whirlwind. The object itself was observed by numerous reliable witnesses over a wide area, and the whirlwind was photographed. This incident thus constitutes an unusually well-documented case of a UFO sighting with associated ground phenomena.
The case is significant also in that the object was observed under daylight conditions, and for a relatively long period of time. Most UFO sightings are of short duration and occur at night. This case represents one of the few instances where an unidentified object of large size has been observed for an extended period in broad daylight.
