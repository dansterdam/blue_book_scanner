UFO Sighting
Reported by Nun
R8,NRO3PO, 8 March 1
Written by the Mother Superior at
Mother St. Bede's Convent in
the quaint fishing village of
Northeast Harbor, Maine.
She spotted an unusual object in
the sky near the Somes Sound
inlet, which appeared "like*
landing lights on a plane, but
flying in an erratic manner."
The "unusually bright" object
was found above the mountain
range and seemed to be
stationary at times.
Mrs. X told other witnesses in
the area of the sighting and two
"nuns also reported seeing the
same object near the nearby Watts
Reservoir.
