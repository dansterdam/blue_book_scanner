The image contains two sketches. The top sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, and an object above it, illustrating how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The bottom sketch shows two larger sketches - one showing a landscape with a person in the foreground, and another smaller sketch showing a more distant landscape with a curved horizon line.

Based on the instructions, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.
33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" on the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" as its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
