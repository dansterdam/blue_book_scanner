The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

31 OCTOBER 1961

Your recent card to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, dated 15 May 1961, has been referred to the Air Force.

Although your description of the sighting you witnessed does not contain sufficient (astronomical) data to permit a detailed analysis, it is of interest to us and has been made a part of our files.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM E. GUTMAN, JR.
