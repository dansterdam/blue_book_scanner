On Thursday, May 21, 1964, I was camping with a friend on the North shore of Lake McCoy in Ontario, Canada. Lake McCoy is approximately forty miles North and is somewhat to the East of White River, Ontario. The camp was about a mile or a mile and one-half from the East end of the Lake.

On the evening of Thursday, May 21, 1964, Messrs. called my attention to four moving lights which were visible in the Eastern sky. The lights were apparently moving from South to North and were between 15' and 30' from the horizon. They gave off a reddish or orangish glow, and the lights had a texture, something like a Roman Candle. The lights were not very large and moved in an irregular manner with the leading light pulling far ahead of the other three lights and the last two lights almost converging. It appeared to me that the leading light turned to the East when it reached the Northern sky, but in any event, shortly thereafter the lights were obscured from view by low clouds. The lights were probably visible for three or four minutes. There was absolutely no noise. All three of us observed this phenomenon and agreed as to what we had seen. We had observed earlier that the atmosphere was such that at various times there were rings of light around the moon. We believe that this was a consequence of the formation of clouds between us and the moon.
