TO: TDDN/UFO
From the information supplied in the message from 323rd STRATEGIC RECONNAISSANCE SQUADRON, APO 225, it is possible that the targets observed by the aircraft were false targets, possibly ground targets from some distance away, which can be seen on the screen because of anomalous propagation bending or reflecting of the radar waves due to "bubbles" or abnormal variations in the atmosphere.
