To Whom It May Concern:

Please accept this information a UFO sighting. I was watching television around 8:30 pm last night 5-21-66 and noticed a peculiar object in the sky. At first I though it was an airplane but as I watched it, it seemed to be hovering and changing in size and shape. I called my wife and son to come and look at it and they agreed it was definitely not an airplane. The object seemed to hover in one spot for a while, then began to move rapidly in different directions. It would suddenly stop and hover again. This went on for about 15 to 20 minutes. Then it just disappeared or moved out of sight very rapidly. 

My wife and I have had an interest in the UFO phenomena for some time. We have both read considerable literature on the subject and feel that what we saw last night was definitely an unidentified flying object. If you wish any further details, please let me know.

Sincerely,
