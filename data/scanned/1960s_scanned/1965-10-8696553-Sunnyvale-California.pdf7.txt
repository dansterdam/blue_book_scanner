Mrs Hunt/an/SAFOICC/723/2/11 Jan 66

Dear Mr. [redacted],

I apologize for the delay in answering your letter regarding unidentified flying objects.

I am enclosing a copy of the report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force UFO project. This report contains information on our project since its origin in 1947.

Articles such as those published by you in the Sarp-Winter magazine on October 7 and 8 do much to avoid placing this unusual phenomenon in its proper perspective.

Our case files for 1965 were reviewed for sightings from the San Francisco-Oakland metropolitan area and the adjoining Moffett Air Force Base. These reports originated from Vallejo, Concord, Antioch, Walnut Creek, Santa Clara and the surrounding areas. They were evaluated as satellites and various observations of celestial and other phenomena.

Photographs of UFOs are submitted to the Air Force for evaluation of their authenticity and origin. Permission to use these prints and pictures must be obtained from the Chief, Aerospace Audio-Visual Service, Norton Air Force Base. Certain techniques of analysis have been identified as means of determining the nature of various objects.

Thank you for your letter and for your interest in Air Force matters.

Sincerely,

JOHN P. SPAULDING
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Community Relations Division
