24 OCT 62

Maneuvering Star in Calif.
AT 10 P.M. and thereafter on the eve of 24 October 1962, Mrs. Bernice Mclaughlin and her daughter Theresa, of El Cajon, Calif., and her daughter Mona observed a bright star-like object in the northeast sky about 10 degrees above the horizon. At first the object appeared star-like but after approximately 5 minutes it appeared as several dots of light arranged in a horizontal row, each of which appeared to give off light. The observers noticed that the object seemed to move from side to side and then would seem to stop suddenly, then resume its movements. It was evident on the unknown object.
The object made several changes of location, each time traveling at a speed greater than that of military aircraft known to the observers. At one point the object hovered motionless for some time before resuming its movements again. According to W.E. Downs, APRO member who interviewed the observers, there did not seem to be any sound to be observed in relation to the object's maneuvers. The intensity of the object's light varied somewhat during the maneuvers. This but did not appear to be correlated with its motions. Observations were terminated by the observers' need to attend to other matters, and the object did not appear to leave or disappear.
