The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a silhouette or outline of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The text accompanying the image mentions that the writer called the Washington Post Newspaper and reported a "flying saucer", but all they received was a recording saying how many "objects (manmade) were in the sky, etc.". The writer has enclosed two diagrams showing the "approximation of the location of both saucers (or whatever they were)..." and states "Hope it is helpful!"

Gentlemen:

I called-up the Washington Post Newspaper, a few evenings ago, and reported a flying saucer......... The reporter told me to call y'all, but all I received was a recording (most delightful!...didn't know it existed!) saying how many objects (manmade) were in the sky, etc.... 

Well, anyhow..., anyhow, here's the scoop...

Enclosed are two diagrams showing the approximation of the location of both saucers (or whatever they were)......

Hope it is helpful!
