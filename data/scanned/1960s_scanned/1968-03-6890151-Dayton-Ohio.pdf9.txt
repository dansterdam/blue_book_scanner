This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document page from a Project Blue Book UFO report. The text on the page is a list of various UFO phenomena descriptions, such as "Move in a straight line", "Suddenly speed up and run away", "Break up in parts and reappear", and others. Below the list, there are two sections labeled "A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?" and "B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?", where the witness has written responses to these questions.

Project Blue Book was the U.S. Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.
