The image in this document appears to be a diagram or illustration, rather than a photograph. It shows a compass-like image with various labels and instructions related to observing and drawing objects in the sky.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curves show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" where you first saw the object.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
