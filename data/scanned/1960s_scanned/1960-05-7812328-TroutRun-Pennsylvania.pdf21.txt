The text of the document is as follows:

Dear Sir,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 4 May to Mr. Maurice Rice, Department of State, regarding the sighting of an unidentified flying object. 

Your letter contains insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, I request you complete the attached Air Force Questionnaire in regard to the sighting and forward the completed report to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Sincerely,
