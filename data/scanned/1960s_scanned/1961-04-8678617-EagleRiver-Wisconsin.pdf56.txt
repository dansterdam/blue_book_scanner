Well, was it a joke, Mrs. No, it wasn't a joke. I saw it in the sky just as plainly as I'm looking at you now. I would say that it was the first words that was seen it in Eagle River.
He is the plumber in Eagle River who reported that he even visited the animals in his garden.
Are you familiar with him? Have you known him before? Mrs. I have. You know reported that he had talked with the inhabitants, what was your reaction?
Well, I haven't known anything about this situation, How about now.
Tell I believe it. I, of course, was just in the house, and I came out looking, and about 20 feet above the ground, I saw it. And what did you see? Well, I just saw something fly over, just like the guy in Eagle River described except that the same thing, but together. It seemed to me at that time, to come from up above and go down.
Well, I saw it for maybe two or three minutes. That's all I have any military authorities or government agencies questioned on this thing? No, they haven't. I'm trying to get in touch with you. Are any of your people familiar with Judge in Eagle River? Who will do you know him and have you ever heard of flying saucers. According to Eagle River which concerns itself with the study of unidentified flying objects, are you or your people familiar with this organization.
