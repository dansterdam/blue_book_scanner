TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

ON 7 JULY 1968 AT APPROXIMATELY 11:15 PM EDT, I WITNESSED A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SOUTHERN SKY OVER DAYTON, OHIO. THE LIGHT WAS MUCH BRIGHTER THAN ANY STAR OR PLANET AND WAS STATIONARY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. IT THEN BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY WESTWARD AND FINALLY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THE MOVEMENT WAS VERY SLOW AND STEADY, NOT AT ALL LIKE AN AIRCRAFT.
