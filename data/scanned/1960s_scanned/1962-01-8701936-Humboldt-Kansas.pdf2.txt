On the 6th of january 1961 at about 730 pm a light was observed in the sky northwest of Humboldt Kansas. The object appeared to be hovering above a pasture approximately 2 miles from Humboldt on highway 169. This object was observed for about one hour and 45 minutes. The witnesses described it as circular in shape and emitting a pinkish orange glow. It appeared to be about the size of a large automobile. The object did not make any sound and remained stationary throughout the observation. When the object began to move away it accelerated rapidly and was gone from sight in about 10 to 12 seconds. There was no evidence of the object returning. No other witnesses were found in the area. This report was investigated by the USAF and the case file was closed with an explanation that the object was a weather inversion and the lights were from a nearby town. The witness remains unconvinced by this explanation.
