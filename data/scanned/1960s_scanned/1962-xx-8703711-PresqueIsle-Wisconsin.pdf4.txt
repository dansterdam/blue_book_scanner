NO. Case (Information Only) 
3 January 1962 
Woonsocket, Rhode Island

Jan. 2 - Mr. ___ reported three maneuvering lights observed near Pawtucket Dye Works Plant, along with many other observers. During 1962, I was able to uncover two top UFO stories, which never would have reached the news wires, had I not made sure they were followed to proper conclusions. These two reports were only two of many that I personally received and investigated. There had been a number of sightings and incidents reported from the Woonsocket area during this period. 

LT. These two reports concerned the sighting of three discs that maneuvered over Woonsocket, Rhode Island and were sighted by Mr. ___ and a group of other eyewitnesses on January 3, 1962.
