PROJECT 10073 RECORD

TELETYPE
REPORT-29 TECH. INT. CENTER
CLEVELAND OHIO 6 SEPT. 1961

SUMMARY:
HAVING NOTIFIED MAJOR JAMES, AT 7:00 P.M. 6 SEPT 61, THAT I WOULD BE ON ROAD THAT NIGHT TO WORK DETAILS OF THIS CASE. I ARRIVED 7:15 P.M. ON SITE.

THE FIRST OBJECT NOTICED WAS ON AUG. 24TH AT 11:10 P.M. WHILE DRIVING FROM BUCYRUS TO BELLEVUE, OHIO. THIS WAS A GOLDEN COLOR WITH A TAIL THAT WOULD DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR BRIGHTEST. OBJECT ROSE UP AND HOVERED THEN HEADED NORTH AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER ANOTHER OBJECT APPEARED IN THE WESTERN SKY, MOVING SOUTH. IT WAS BRIGHT WHITE AND SEEMED TO HAVE A TRAIL BEHIND IT. IT PASSED OVER A GROUP OF TREES AND I COULDN'T SEE IT ANYMORE.

I CHECKED THE SKIES FOR THE NEXT 10-15 MINUTES AND OBSERVED NOTHING FURTHER.

ON SEPT 1, AT 2:45 A.M., NOTIFIED A BRIGHT OBJECT ABOUT 1/2 MILE WEST OF MY LOCATION. IT SEEMED TO BE MOVING VERY FAST AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS.

ON SEPT. 2ND, OBSERVED TWO OBJECTS DESCRIBED AS ABOUT 75-100 FEET WIDE, SHAPED LIKE A HALF MOON, BLUISH IN COLOR. THESE PASSED OVER THE FARM WHERE I WAS OBSERVING AT AN ESTIMATED HEIGHT OF 500 FT. AND WERE TRAVELING ABOUT 150 MPH. THEY WERE SEEN FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES.

ON SEPT. 3RD, AT ABOUT 8:30 P.M., OBSERVED 3 OBJECTS, BRIGHT WHITE IN COLOR, TRAVELING IN A TRIANGULAR FORMATION ABOUT 500 FT. HIGH. THESE WERE VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 5-6 MINUTES.

ON EACH OF THE 5 OR 6 TIMES THESE OBJECTS WERE SEEN, THEY ALWAYS APPEARED TO BE COMING FROM THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION AND RETURNING THERE. 
AT NO TIME WAS I ABLE TO GET A GOOD PHOTOGRAPH AS THE OBJECTS WERE ALWAYS AT SUCH A HEIGHT AND DISTANCE. 
I ESTIMATE THAT DURING THIS PERIOD ALL THREE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED A TOTAL OF 15 TIMES.
