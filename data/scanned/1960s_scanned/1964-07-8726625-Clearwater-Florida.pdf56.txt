The page appears to be from Project Blue Book and contains a handwritten list of "Convention Officers" including names such as Allen, Breen, Lincoln Park, and Taylor. The image also contains some sketched or drawn shapes and markings, but no clear or distinct object that could be identified as a UFO.
