TDER/UFO (Maj Quintanilla/70916/WsA/26 Sep 67)
UFO Observation, 22 August 1967

Sir: Minnesota 55731

Reference your observation of August 22, 1967 which you reported the Air Force has previously investigated your observation.

The aerial phenomena branch did perform an investigation on your sighting and found that your comments contain excellent detail of your observation. The object was described as a dark, elliptical shape at approximately 45 degrees, at an elevation of six degrees, maintaining an even speed and altitude. The speed was estimated as approximately 15 degrees per second. At one point, the object gained a noticeable gain in speed and altitude. This phenomena was again observed on your reporting of the 22 August 1967 incident.

I have interpreted your comments on the new identified flying object (NFO).
