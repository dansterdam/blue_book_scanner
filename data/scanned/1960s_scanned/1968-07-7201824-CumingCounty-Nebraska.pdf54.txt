Observations on CB July 1964

Von Dal Chamberlain, Project Director 
"Report for (Rapid) Analysis of Fireball Trajectories"
AFCRL Scientific Report No. 64-815
Contract No. AF 19(628)-2253 
Last Review: 8 Aug 1964

OBSERVATION: Our fireball trajectories projects is an interim report on work done on 23 July 1964 concerning the fireball event observed over the north-central U.S. on 2 July 1964. This report is very interesting in the fireball and satellite observations made at that time. You can provide data on the trajectory of the fireball, along with any information on associated phenomena that you may have. This information would be appreciated and 1964 would be most useful.
