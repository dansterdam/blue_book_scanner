interests me very, very much, because I can't exactly figure
out that they were stars.  This diamond formation that you saw
- now how did it differ from the stars in the general area.
S: Well, you should see that it was lower. I mean - it stood out
like something that would be a mile high as opposed to something
that was/2O miles high.  You could see that it was definitely
lower and that it wasn't a star. The color was different, the
brightness - it was brighter, much brighter.  You could see it
wasn't a star. There were many, many, many stars in the sky.
H: This is a point that I am very much interested in getting down,
because I know the Air Force will surely say: "Well, it was stars
they saw."  And I want to be able to say - well, how do you
explain this then, you know, is the same thing of course
those - if you hold your thumbs straight out in front of you as
far as you can and had held this up over the diamond formation
would the thumbs have mass covered the thing, or not quite, or
Si: Oh, no - I would say the thumbs wouldn't cover two of them.  You know,
one directly above the other.  But the others would be - you would
have to face your thumb in the other direction (H: I get you)
to get them all.  If I recall correctly, they were quite
a bit apart.
H: You've given me something new that I didn't get from Mr Moore.
the impression that they were lower down than the sky, so to speak.
S: Yes.
H: Now, were they all of exactly the same brightness?
S: Well, I would say yes, they were, except for the interest of the
light seemed to change.  I mean it would set brighter, then a
little duller or all, not together, but individually.
