Bilston boy sees saucer
A 12-year-old Bilston boy claims he saw a flying saucer hover over Bilston town centre last night and saw four figures inside it. The boy, David Harlow, of Hinck's Street, Bilston, said that at about 10:30 p.m. yesterday he was walking home from football training when the saucer appeared, hovering over the centre of the town. He said three friends with him also saw the saucer, which was circular in shape, bright and seemed to emit rays of light. Harlow said the saucer hovered for several minutes, moving slowly up and down. Then, while the four of them watched, it shot away at terrific speed in the direction of Wolverhampton. Harlow claims he saw four figures inside the saucer, which he says was about the size of a double-decker bus. Bilston police say they have received no reports of any such sighting, and that the incident remains unidentified.
