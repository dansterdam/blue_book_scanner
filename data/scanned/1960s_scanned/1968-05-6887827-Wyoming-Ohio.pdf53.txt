MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Reference UFO Observation of 31 May 63, Ohio.

12 September 1963: Colonel Lewis called to say that he had finally completed his form and was going to send it to us or bring it down to the office. He also wanted to know what we had found out about his sighting. I said that I didn't remember it. Colonel Lewis gave some of the details over the phone. OF particular interest was the fact that he was located quite close to the Linden Co. Airport and called them at the time of the sighting. They did not paint the object; none of the Incidents aircraft reported it, and the tower personnel couldn't see the lights either. Colonel Lewis will probably call back Monday, 16 August 1963.
