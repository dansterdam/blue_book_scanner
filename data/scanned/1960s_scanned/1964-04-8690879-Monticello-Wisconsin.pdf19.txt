As an OCR system, the text contained in the document is as follows:

"The witnesses, I find it impossible to dismiss this instance as a product of excited imaginations or as a desire for publicity, etc. Indeed, these witnesses had no intention of telling their story originally, the only factors, I believe it is, is a Marine and felt it was their duty to report it.

On the way home, all of us agreed that no formal questionnaire can bring out the sense and detail of a sighting or an adequate estimate of the reliability of the observers, that a personal interview can. But we also agreed that failing a personal interview, a request for a simple narrative statement from the witnesses, answering only a few specific questions would be preferable, at least in the first instance, to a questionnaire. 

In short, we have the witness tell in his own words, guided by just a brief outline as to what the incident seemed to be, as to what is was he saw, when was it day or night, what was the duration of the sighting and how many persons were with the observer. We can get the names, telephone numbers, etc. better if the time seems appropriate. In addition it has often been our experience that skillful questioning can unwittingly lead a witness, so a questionnaire may not be the best approach.

It can't be an unguided narrative. Just a few prepared questions. Besaides, most people would regard questionnaires as somewhat governmental, bureaucracy and may be afraid to say nothing or shying away from overcoming the normal hesitancy of telling such a report. If, on the other hand, they are asked to answer simply an oral narrative as they were telling it to a neighbor, I think we would get an added dimension that somehow has to be dealing in actual human beings and not just impersonal questionnaires. And I realize that I had to admit to having the particular questionnaire view, but I think it certainly seems an approach in any case."
