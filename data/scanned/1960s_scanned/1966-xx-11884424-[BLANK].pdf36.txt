SUBJECT: UFO Reports and Case Histories 

TO: Dr. Anthony Cacioppo
FTD (TDCS)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Dr. Cacioppo,

I am enclosing communication from Dr. Carl Sagan who is a member of the SAB Ad Hoc Committee on UFOs. Dr. Sagan has looked into the UFO matter and several items he thinks would be fruitful for the Committee to discuss at the 3 February meeting. I have cleared with Dr. O'Brien and we will appreciate your assembling these case histories and reports and making them available to Dr. Sagan and the Committee.

If the reports are not classified it might be advantageous to loan them to Dr. Sagan so he can review them prior to the meeting.

Sincerely,

HAROLD A. STEINER
Assistant Secretary
USAF Scientific Advisory Board

Cy to: Dr. O'B
Dr. Sagan
