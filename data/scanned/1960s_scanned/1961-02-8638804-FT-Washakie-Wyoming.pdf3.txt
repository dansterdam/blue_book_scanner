Dear Mr. Wilson:

When 2nd McCIoskey visited you on 29 March he requested that he would advise you as to the results of his examination of the matter of the object which you found or to determine the nature of same, which is in this case either some as automobile or from a light aircraft. It is entirely possible that it may have become detached from some aircraft. It is entirely possible that it may have become detached from same aircraft and fallen to earth and that it is not whatsoever connected or related to any activity that might be described as an explosive item and therefore not harmful in this situation.

2. Thank you very much for your courtesy in drawing the matter to the attention of appropriate authorities concerning the nature of this object in Washakie, Wyoming, and I remain with expressions of warmest personal regards.

Sincerely

FRANKLIN A. JOSEPH
