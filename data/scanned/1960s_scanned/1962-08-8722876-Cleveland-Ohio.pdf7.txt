Concerning our telephone conversation this morning, I am enclosing the Project Blue Book Report on the Unidentified Flying Object observed last night by one of our neighbors on Aurora Avenue in Cleveland Heights.

This sighting was made approximately between 9:05 and 9:20 p.m. EST on August 8, 1962. The object was described as being round, glowing golden or orange in color, and moving from the east to the west at a fairly rapid rate of speed. It seemed to be at an altitude of approximately 2000-3000 feet. The object appeared to be larger than the full moon, and flashed intermittently. There was no sound associated with the observation.

Based on the relative timing and location of the observation, it seems probable that this UFO sighting may have been a part of the same overall phenomenon witnessed by a number of other observers in the Greater Cleveland area during the same general time frame. These other sightings are also being reported to Project Blue Book.

I trust that this provides you with the information requested.
