The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page discusses the results of a Navy investigation and analysis of information supplied to Project Blue Book about an unidentified flying object reported by the Patuxent River Air Station on December 29, 1964. The document indicates that a check with an independent radar complex at Patuxent River revealed no unidentified radar sector centers on the east coast.

Based on the results of a Navy investigation and analysis of the information supplied to Project Blue Book by the Patuxent River Air Station, it has been determined that the target reported by the Patuxent River Air Station as an unidentified flying object on 29 Dec 1964 was a valid target. The shape and illumination of the target indicates that it was created by some other electronic device within the vicinity of the radar set itself or was caused by some disturbance within the circuitry of the radar set. A check with an independent radar complex at Patuxent River and with the east coast radar sector centers revealed no unidentified radar returns.
