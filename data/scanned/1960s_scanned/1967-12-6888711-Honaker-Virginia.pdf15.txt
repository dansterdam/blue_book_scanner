The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. There is no photograph present on this particular page. As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? no

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes (Don't know)

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) No (Don't know)

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound A strange - unlike any sound I've ever heard
b. Color Bright white with a reddish-orange light flickering on 
   and off

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object would have been covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? IT'S IMPDSSIBLE-CDgER

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects, label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the direction the object was moving.
