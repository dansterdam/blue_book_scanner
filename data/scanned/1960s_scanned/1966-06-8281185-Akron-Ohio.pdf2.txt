OCT 11 1966

Dear Mr. and Mrs. *****

Reference is made to your unidentified observation on June 28, 1966. Contact was made with the Federal Aviation Agency at the Akron-Canton Airport for information regarding this incident. You were observed by the Goodyear Aircraft Company in Akron. The FAA informed us that the Goodyear blirfp was flying in the Akron area around the same time.

We, in turn, contacted Mr. ***** of the Goodyear Company to obtain the following information:

"On June 28, the Goodyear blirfp was flying in the Akron area - 11:30 - 11:50 p.m. The blirfp has the normal running lights that are required by the FAA, and it landed on its home base at 11:50 p.m. The blirfp flies at an altitude of 1,000 - 1,500 feet and the speed is about 50 mph.

We were puzzled that such a craft would be flying at night, but the blirfp was in the air until 11:30 that night. Adverse lighting conditions such as this are often mistaken by persons because of the lighting configuration and because of the relative speed and altitude of the vehicle. You will note that you observed this blirfp, especially since it was in the immediate vicinity and was coupled with the lighting conditions.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force and to assure you we do not reieaoe.
