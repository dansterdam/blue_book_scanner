Extracted text from the document:

"On Monday, July 20, 1964, I called the U.S.A.F. office in Dayton, Ohio and reported the incident. I was told no one was available to investigate it at that time but that someone would call me later on July 20, 1964 (Sunday). 

On July 22, 1964, a Capt. J. Holt Hargrave came to see me. He was most interested and said he would make a full report on it. 

On Monday, July 20, 1964, I also called the U.S. Air Force Tracking Station. I was told we had in all probability seen a distant reflection of one of the missiles that were being fired that day as part of a test program. However, I do not believe this could have been the case, because the object was solid and sharply defined, and it did not appear to move or change shape. The tracking station said that it was quite possible for a nearby object to come to a point of observation and disappearance, and that is not what the book says the Air Force should do. This is not what I saw.

July 17, 1964. (At the same time this occurred, there was a Mercury launching scheduled for that date, but it was postponed and moved to 1:16 P.M. on the 18th.) On this date, residents spotted a large, high-flying object hovering above and apparently sighting their location. It was a bright, silvery object, which hovered briefly, then sped away at a terrific rate of speed. The object was observed by a number of witnesses, all of whom were amazed at its sudden appearance and departure. It was a very bright, nearly motionless object which seemed to hang in the sky for a few minutes and then suddenly accelerate and disappear from sight. The weather was clear and the object was constantly illuminated, which was what made it so impressive to those who saw it."
