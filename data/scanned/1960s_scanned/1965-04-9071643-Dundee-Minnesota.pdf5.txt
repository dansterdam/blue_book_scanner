AN INTERVIEW BY THE INVESTIGATOR WITH THE OBSERVER REVEALED THE FOLLOWING FACTS OBSERVED LIVES ALONE ON A FARM ON THE WEST EDGE OF KINDRAE, MINN. HE IS A RETIRED MAIL CARRIER AND DIVORCEE. HE HAS LIVED ALONE FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS. DURING THE INTERVIEW THE OBSERVER STATED THAT A SIMILAR INCIDENT (WHICH HE DID NOT REPORT) OCCURRED WHEN 2 RUSSIAN MIG AIRCRAFT APPEARED ON HIS FARM. HE INDICATED THAT HE SPOKE WITH THEM DURING THIS TIME. HE WOULD OFFER NO FURTHER INFORMATION OF THIS INCIDENT. IN VIEW OF THE IMPROBABILITY OF SUCH AN INCIDENT IT IS THE OPINION OF THE PREPARING OFFICIAL THAT TOTAL CREDIBILITY OF THIS OBSERVATION IS DOUBTFUL.
