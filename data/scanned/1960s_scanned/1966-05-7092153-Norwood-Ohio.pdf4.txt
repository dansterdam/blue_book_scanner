There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): YES No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): YES No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what
in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Noise unnatural sound white bright object
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size: Held a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
1. 1/8 of the object would have been covered by the match head
2. A smaller portion would have been covered by the match head

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
