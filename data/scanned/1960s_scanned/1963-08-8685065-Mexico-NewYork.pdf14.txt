Rowley Meteor
Or Georgetown
Pyrotechnics?
Rowley, Aug. 4 - A huge flying meteor about 3000 feet high was reported to have lit up the sky over eastern Massachusetts shortly before midnight Friday. Police and Fire department officials in many areas, Butler said the light was visible over a wide radius and some remarked that at the highest point the object seemed to break up and pieces came tumbling down. A Georgetown use of the municipal fireworks display that evening seems to have coincided with the sighting, leading some to doubt the meteor theory. However, one witness said the light was visible long before the fireworks celebration began."
