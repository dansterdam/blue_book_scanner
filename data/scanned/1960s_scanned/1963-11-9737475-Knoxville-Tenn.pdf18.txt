THE SALTWOOD MYSTERY
Strange happenings in Kent

The evening of Saturday, November 16, 1963, was clear and bright. The moon was full, and many people were out walking in the area known as the Saltwood village... It was a quiet scene, with people going about their normal activities. Suddenly, a bright light was observed in the sky, near the Saltwood Castle. This light seemed to be moving rapidly in an erratic manner, zigzagging back and forth. It would flare up brightly, then fade almost to invisibility, only to reappear again.

The light was first noticed by a group of people walking along a country lane. They stopped to watch the strange manifestation. The light seemed to be descending towards them, then abruptly it would shoot upwards at a tremendous speed. This happened several times, to the amazement of the onlookers. 

The light was also observed by people in other parts of the area. A couple on a country road stopped their car to watch the aerial display, as did several other motorists. All were intrigued by the rapidly moving light, which appeared to be the size of a large star. It was seen by many reliable witnesses over a wide area.

After a time, the light suddenly disappeared behind trees and a few seconds later, reappeared in a new position. This happened several times, giving the impression that the light had wings and was maneuvering behind the trees. 

Another witness, John McCandrick, said he saw a circular object, about the size of a small aircraft, also in the sky. This object had flashing lights around the rim and seemed to be moving silently. It suddenly shot upwards at tremendous speed and disappeared from view.

The strange aerial phenomena were seen by many people over a wide area and caused much speculation and discussion. Some thought it might have been a spacecraft from another world. Others suggested it was some kind of experimental aircraft. Whatever the explanation, the incidents caused much excitement and interest in the Saltwood district on that November evening.
