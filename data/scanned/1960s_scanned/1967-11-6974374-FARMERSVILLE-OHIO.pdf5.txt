Text from the document:

CASE: 5 Nov. 1967 Farmersville, Ohio
Longitude of Farmersville west of the 75th meridian, and corrects for the difference in the meridian of observation. The observer estimated the size of the object to be about as large as the moon, and stated the moon had a southern declination, and the fact that he didn't see the moon makes the observer almost certain three makes
it brighter than the moon, wasn't quite as large as the moon. An observation-more like a 4-8 piece, but that's a normal exaggeration. The observer indicated his object was smaller than observer indicated his object was smaller than the moon, but I do not think this was a serious, also, he said he thought it was smaller than the "moon wouldn't be visible" - well, it was.
