CHEMICAL CLOUDS TO BE VISIBLE ALONG EAST COAST

A National Aeronautics and Space Administration chemical experiment, beginning January 17, will send huge and easily visible colored clouds wafting along the eastern coast of the United States.

Weather conditions permitting, the first of five vapor cloud launchings is scheduled for Monday at 5:38 p.m. EST. The other vapor experiments are to be fired one and one-half, three, and six hours after the first launch, with the remaining experiment scheduled for about 6:45 o'clock Tuesday morning.

The dusk-to-dawn firings for meteorological research in the upper atmosphere will be at NASA's Wallops Station on the Virginia Coast.

Both sodium vapor and trimethylaluminum (TMA) experiments will be conducted in this series. Two-stage solid propellant Nike-Apache research rockets will be programmed to eject trails of vapor from about 50 to 125 statute miles altitude.
