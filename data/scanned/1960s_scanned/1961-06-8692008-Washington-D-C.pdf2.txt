The object appeared over the Potomac River. The witness was standing on the bank of the river when he observed the object. It appeared to come from the direction of the airport, and the witness watched it as it flew directly overhead and then seemed to settle into the river. The witness then went on foot to the location where the object seemed to land and searched for some time to give some investigation to the incident to determine if any other physical evidence might be left at that spot.
