There is no photograph present in the image provided. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"1. One notable meteorological condition that may have contributed to the sighting is the unusual weather pattern stated that heavy overcast clouds from the north prevented a full moon on the night of the incident. A descending balloon would have appeared very similar to the observed object.

2. The observer reported his sighting lasted 20 minutes 4 seconds. After first observing it, he watched it for 10 minutes before it went behind a cloud. After finding no clues that it was an aircraft, it was assumed to be a balloon. No aircraft were found in the area.

3. As the descent of the object was not observed, it would be difficult to determine that it was an aircraft. The lighting around the Williamsburg airport may have given the impression the it was nearer, and higher, than it actually was.

4. A check was made with the FAA facility at Richmond by Colonel, and no flights were reported at the time of the sighting.

5. This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert Eazor, 1st Lt USAF Langley Air Force Base, Virginia (63-13), Logan C. Brooks, Civilian, Project Blue Book," and provides no additional information that would cause me to conclude anything other than what is stated by the document.
