Dear Miss Hunt:

It sighted the object on the ttin last Sunday night (October 31st) at approximately 8:30 p.m. outside my home in Efland, North Carolina. It appeared to be slightly larger than a small merchant aircraft about 50 feet in diameter. The object was stationary and was located at an angle between land and directly overhead. The object was illuminated in front and sides with a blue-green color increasing and decreasing in intensity from time to time as the object was slowly rotating. There were no sound or exhaust flame observed. The object would move to the left or right, move closer or move away to the television station at one point. It set up a camera on a tripod and that caught the object on film. I informed the nearest air force bases and several other people in this area had also seen the object. However, I'm not certain that my sighting has been made known to NASA or other proper authorities. Since the object was sighted by many people through the duration of the observation, the description that has been given seems to be perfectly reliable."
