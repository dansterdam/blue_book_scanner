   This statement is in regard to an observation I made on the evening of December 8, 1960. At approximately 9:00 PM, I was driving along a highway in the Bronx, New York when I observed a peculiar object in the sky. The object appeared to be round in shape and had a glowing light around the perimeter. It seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly across the sky. I watched it for several minutes before it disappeared from view. I am unsure of the exact nature or origin of the object I observed, but I felt it was sufficiently unusual to warrant reporting.
