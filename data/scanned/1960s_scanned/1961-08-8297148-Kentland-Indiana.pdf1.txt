10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Radar operators were part of a routine training mission on 3 Aug 51 when an unknown target was picked up on radar. The target was tracked for approx 10 mins and was observed to make several abrupt changes in course and speed. Target was lost when it climbed out of range. No visual sighting or photo. Conventional aircraft could not do what this target did. Possibility that it may have been a remote controlled or radio controlled model. However, this seems unlikely due to size and maneuverability of the target.
11. COMMENTS: Brief description as indicated above. Radar operators were experienced and reliable. Phenomena of such nature as to indicate something out of the ordinary. Could not be identified as any known type of aircraft or other object. Movements and performance characteristics were inconsistent with any known aircraft.
