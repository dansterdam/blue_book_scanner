Dear Madam,

1. Referring to your letter dated 14th March, 1963, regarding the request for information, I regret to inform you that as indicated by the Director of Electronic Warfare Research, Headquarters Joint Intelligence Bureau, the Department of Air has no conclusive evidence to substantiate the existence of unidentified flying objects.

2. However, we are aware that there are reports of sightings of unusual aerial phenomena in many ways similar to those objects classed as unidentified flying objects. The Department of Air is continuing to investigate these reports as diligently as possible.

3. I accept this opportunity to emphasize to you that while the Department of Air is sympathetic to your interest in this matter, we are unable to do more than record reports and endeavour to identify the source of the sightings. Our firm conclusion is that the nature of the object or phenomenon observed cannot be satisfactorily determined.

Yours faithfully,

A.R. Vallance
Air Officer Commanding
