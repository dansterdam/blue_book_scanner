This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads as follows:

"Note added after main report typed:
This additional may have a bearing, although a rank, but moving lights have around the area of Indiana for some time; enclosed is a one correspondence card relevant to this possibility. There appears to be considerable evidence all in regard to the activities of the Warrick County Sheriff's department in Booneville, Dale and Evansville, that there are falls of glowing material that move through the air at various speeds. Officer told me that this has often made of seeing them, and this was years ago, so it is certainly no phenomena. I see no reason to doubt that some such phenomenon conceivably exists though it is difficult imagining at this institution recognition of it. I assume that the phenomenon is a supernatural or related to visits from of course i have no way of such other theories."
