17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - None
b. Color - Luminescent white to yellow
c. Size - Appeared to be the size of a small aircraft

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered? The object was extremely small, less than 1/4 the size of the match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing the estimated size, shape, color, and specifically shown trails or motion. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[Handwritten notes describing the object as a bright, small round or pear-shaped luminous object that moved slowly and silently, disappearing gradually.]
