NEW ZEALAND
Unidentified Photograph
The original copy of the photograph described below was made in New Zealand on April 23, 1960. It shows an unusual and brightly lit oblong object in the sky. 
The witness reported that the object remained stationary for about 15 minutes, then rapidly gained altitude and disappeared from view. 
The witness concluded that the object was artificial and not a natural phenomenon. An analysis of the photograph by a photographic expert indicated that there was no evidence of hoax or trick photography.
