This witness states that she was frightened and ran to the window. She found that "water-birds" all the cows seemed to be.

The strange object that she observed was estimated to be at least half a mile (unless there is a closer view than the one the investigator.s found), and thus much larger than the one the investigator.s found), and thus much larger than the "flying saucer" reported earlier on this date.

The shape of the object was determined roughly by showing the girl three rectangles, one square, one with a length-to-width ratio of about 3 to 2, and one with a ratio of about 2 to 1. She picked the middlc one, adding that the comers were "rounded slightly".

The object appeared about half or each side cut off, about 4 inches, and about an eighth the picked the dash-dot-dot picture. She indicated that it was not like the "flying saucer" picture labelled "Figure A", which some authorities object to show as an example of what is meant.
