Dear Sir:

My classmate and I are very interested in UFO's. We also have a date in Britain on that subject soon. We'd appreciate any information you can give us to aid with informative information to the public, but we thought you might be able to send us something regarding UFO's. Please send us any information you can or will.

On the night of March 2, 3, and until 6:00 PM on March 4, 1964 my mother and I looked out windows and saw a bright yellowish object. It looked at it through binoculars and through an instrument that standing still at about 230 degrees west of our house. My mother came to the window and verified what I saw. Then after a few minutes she kept looking again and it disappeared.

Sincerely,
(Signature)
