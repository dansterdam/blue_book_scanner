I have had many sightings of such objects over the past several years, which I have observed quite closely. My interest in the subject is strong and I have given considerable thought to the possibility that these objects represent some form of extra-terrestrial intelligences. I have discussed the matter with many persons, both local and national, and it seems to me that there is much more to this subject than the public is generally aware of. The instances of sightings are so numerous and the reports so consistent that it would appear to defy any normal explanation.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?

I DISCUSSED IT WITH SEVERAL FRIENDS, THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO BELIEVE ME FULLY.
