K. Comments of Investigator: I was able to talk to
only the male, and to obtain statements from the two
police officers who were on the scene. The chief
of police and additional patrolmen were taken. The
female companion is Mrs. Stankievicz, and she was
also interviewed. Miss Klem was described as being in a state of shock
but rapidly recovering from the incident. The two
who were present at the initial interview, there appear
to be discrepancies in descriptions between Mr. Fibbert
and Miss Klem.
