The image contains a handwritten description and sketch of a strange object witnessed. The text states that the object was "ONE LARGE WHITE GLOW BREAKING INTO TWO WHITE GLOWS, AND TRAVELING OUT OF SIGHT". The sketch shows an elongated, branching object. There appears to be no photographic image present in this document.

My analysis of the text in the document is as follows:

OTHER STRANGE OBJECTS WE'VE SEEN:
ONE LARGE WHITE GLOW BREAKING INTO TWO WHITE GLOWS, AND TRAVELING OUT OF SIGHT.
My husband and brother-in-law saw this sight while traveling on OCT. 4, 1966.
