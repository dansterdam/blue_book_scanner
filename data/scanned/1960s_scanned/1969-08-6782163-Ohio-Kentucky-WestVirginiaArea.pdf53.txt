SUBJECT: Fireball Sighting, 5 Aug 69

Observer: Carlisle, OHIO 45005
Telephone Nr: 743-4795

Date: 5 Aug 69
Time: Approximately 0130 hours
Duration: Few seconds

Description: The observer sighted an object (light) similar to a well-lit torch with a greenish case. The light lit up the sky and traveled at a tremendous speed parallel to the ground. It appeared to be moving in a trail consisting of several second-small fragments. Observer was near Gratis at the time.

Comments: Told the observer that the stimulus was probably a fireball and that I would like his permission to complete an AF Form 117 so that I could give the report to Dr. Olivier.
