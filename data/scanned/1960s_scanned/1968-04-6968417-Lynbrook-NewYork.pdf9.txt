DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL A MOMENT?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
SEEM TO PULSATE AND EXPLODE?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE SHAPE?
PLAY OR BE SEEN TO DISAPPEAR?
SAN LIKE A TOY?
MAKE A NOISE?
APPEAR OR SEEM TO ATTRACT PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
IS IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

IT DISAPPEARED WHEN SO MANY OTHERS BECAME AWARE OF ITS PRESENCE.

DID THE MOTION MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING?
