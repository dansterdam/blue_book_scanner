NAHA (OKINAWA) 
8 OCTOBER 1962 
CASE NO. 62-10872
FINAL EVALUATION - PROBABLY EXPLAINABLE PHENOMENON 
1. This case is based on a report from USAF authorities on Okinawa concerning sightings on 8 October 1962. 
2. The first sighting occurred at 1730 hours when a number of round unidentified objects were observed flying high and fast in a south-north direction over Okino Erabu Shima. Airman 1st Class M. A. Pringle and two other airmen at Kadena Air Force Base observed the objects through binoculars. The objects appeared to be dark in color and flying at an estimated altitude of 40,000 feet.
3. The second sighting occurred at 1900 hours when seven round, luminous objects were reported to be maneuvering over Naha Air Base. Lt Phillip K. S. Platt, 18th Tactical Fighter Wing, described the objects as being about 8-10 feet in diameter, light in color, and very bright. The objects were reported to descend slowly from an altitude of 40,000 feet to about 10,000 feet, then accelerate and disappear. Lt Platt estimated the speed of the objects to be 600-700 mph. 
4. The final evaluation indicates that the first sighting was probably the re-entry of a space object and the second sighting was most likely a meteor or a meteor-like phenomenon.
