UFO SIGHTING, 27 SEP 65

TO: USAF SAFOJCO (Mrs Hunt)
REFERENCE: YOUR ATTACHED LETTER DATED 5 OCT 65 IN WHICH YOU REQUESTED THAT A COPY UNDER GO YOUR VIEW. THE UNCLASSIFIED FILE COPY OF THIS REPORT WAS FORWARDED TO MRS HUNT AS REQUESTED ON THE DATE OF 5 OCT 65. 

SUMMARY: ON THE NIGHT OF 27 SEP 65, A USAF OFFICER STATIONED AT RICHARDS-GEBAUR AFB, MISSOURI OBSERVED AN OBJECT IN THE SKY FROM HIS HOME. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE AND MOVING RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SKY FROM WEST TO EAST. IT WAS REPORTED TO BE EMITTING A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT THAT COULD BE SEEN FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE. THE OFFICER STATED THAT HE COULD NOT IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC OBJECT. HE BELIEVED IT WAS SOME TYPE OF AIRCRAFT BUT DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS. THEREFORE, IT IS PROBABLE THAT HIS SIGHTING CONSTITUTES AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
