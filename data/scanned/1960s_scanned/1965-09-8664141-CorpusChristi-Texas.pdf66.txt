The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing a "Rocketdyne Saucer" that was observed. The text reads as follows:

Rocketdyne Saucer
Form: The object sighted was a metallic, disc-shaped craft, estimated to be about 20-25 feet in diameter. It appeared to be of solid construction, with no visible protrusions. The top surface was dome-shaped and had a dark, dull finish. The bottom surface was flat and gleaming. The craft appeared to be hovering at treetop level. 
Behavior: The craft was observed to be ascending and descending slowly, and moving east to west very fast.
Remark: The witness is an employee of Rocketdyne, and thanks for consideration.
