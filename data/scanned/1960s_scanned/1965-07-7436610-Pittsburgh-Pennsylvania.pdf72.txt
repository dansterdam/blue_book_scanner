The image does not contain any photograph or visual content. It appears to be a handwritten document with text written in cursive.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Some description of phenomenon as seen. A bright light moved rapidly across the sky. It seemed to be descending slightly at first then leveled off and moved on a straight course for about a minute and a half traveling north to south at an estimated speed of 1000-1500 mph. The object was not visible, but a bright light reflected in the clouds below it. The light was a steady white, not blinking or pulsing.

I consider this report evaluatively potentially significant. The time of observation, location, and description of the observed phenomenon suggest it may have been an authentic UFO sighting.

Thank you.
