I have watched the object arising for well over a years time. Note on question 29. The object which arose, has no set pattern, and when it first appeared, the object across seemed almost straight up, lately, as time permitted me to watch it, it has driven much erratically, from horizon. The object has become larger, by size, some 15 miles northeast, which should but the object well on my left as I return home.

I have shown this object to men who served in the Air Force, particularly, who admit being trained to recognize aircraft, they admit it could not be a natural phenomenon nor an aircraft or any other recognize object. I saw a large object arising over the hill in the rear of 3.M., and it still in California, about S-C Fremont, when my wife saw the flashes, she went in and brought out a pair of small binoculars. It was while looking at it, the larger object arose from behind the hill.

This object seen through a 40x60 scope- is round.
