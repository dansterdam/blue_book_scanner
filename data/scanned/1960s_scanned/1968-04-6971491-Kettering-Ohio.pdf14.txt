WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

It appeared, it seemed to come here with great speed, it seemed to be about a mile away from me, and it seemed stationary for about two minuets, then it just disappeared.

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

It simply faded methodically from sight, rather than an abrupt disappearance.

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

It was floating and hovering in the central southwest direction, not in front of or behind anything that I could see. It did not make any noise that I could hear, and did not have any tail or trail behind it that I could see. It had no flashing lights or colored lights, but was just a bright, white, luminous glow, and was quite a ways off. When it finally disappeared, it didn't seem to gradually go out, but rather just faded out of sight.
