PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 8-11-1960
2. LOCATION: Danbury, Conn.
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2050
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: 1 Ground-Radar
5. SOURCE: CAFTI
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 25 min.
7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
9. COURSE: Northeast to Southwest
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Object was round, pinkish-orange in color, glowing, and traveling at a high rate of speed. It was observed by radar at a distance of approx 35 miles. Then sighting was in agreement with visual observation at nearby Mt. Catrigali.
11. COMMENTS: Suggestion responsible for this sighting was probably "ball lightning". It was described as a round shape with a reddish-orange glow, quite brilliant, and moving rapidly at an altitude of around 35,000 ft. This phenomenon can be fit in the sidereal description given by the witness. Disappearation of lightning may occur due to change of temperature which causes a color change, and an explosion may occur which causes the phenomenon to disappear. This is a doubtful case regarding the nature of the observation.
