En route to pick up a friend, I noticed several odd shaped objects in the sky... some weaving around in an erratic pattern appearing and disappearing. Others were hovering, motionless in the sky. I pulled the car over and watched them for about 15 minutes. There were around 4-5 main objects that were visible at any one time, although others would appear and disappear. The objects seemed to be reflecting sunlight in a rather odd manner, and would occasionally emit a sudden burst of speed and then resume their hovering or erratic pattern of flight. I found the objects to be rather awe-inspiring and have thought about this incident many times since then. I am unable to offer any explanation as to what these objects were, but they were definitely not any type of conventional aircraft that I am familiar with.
