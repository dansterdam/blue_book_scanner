I felt it is about a report to be seen as a sighting to be considered to have been an unusual phenomena occured. They stated that they reported the saw a strange object in the sky which they were unable to identify. What they said that they estimate its size as approximately about 35 to 40 feet in diameter and the object 15 to 20 feet over the ground and perhaps a triangle to triangulate. 
If some of the visual Air Force scientists could not explain this sighting then it seems to be very strange aircraft. If so, it should be reported to their Air Force personnel. Possibly, the thing seems to be floating in the air with no apparent source of propulsion. And one of the main points would be the last one to inprect that he could not how he tell them about. 
I would not a little more detailed if we will be appreciate any clarification you may have on this incident. Sincerely yours,
