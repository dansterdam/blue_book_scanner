Dear Gentlemen,

I've seen a flying object more definite than anything I've seen before. It was hovering about 20 minutes, complaining across the sky over 20 miles and then disappeared. It came slowly about 7 miles long and you could see the outline very clearly at a height of 25 degree angle.

To see - about September 10-20, 1965
Same as above - cigar-shaped coming to a point at each end
