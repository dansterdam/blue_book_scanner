Sheboygan, Wis.
May 4, 1966

Appeared in a magazine. It seems that a large airplane, (or plane) with unusual lights, was observed over the Sheboygan area that night. The lights were reported to be glowing brightly. One witness stated that some white lights were glowing beside the craft. The other sighting, which by the witnesses seemed to be contained in the same report, was that of a missile shape, with two other lights at the rear. At one point there were 4 or 5 of these objects in the sky, moving separately and seemingly at a much higher altitude than the large plane-like craft.
The object seemed to be fairly close at the time and had size enough to allow a clear observation though details coul 1 not te made out. Not all I could make out of the t~xtO the witnesses, but that is the substance of it. No photograph - just a report with a very brief sketch of the sightings.
