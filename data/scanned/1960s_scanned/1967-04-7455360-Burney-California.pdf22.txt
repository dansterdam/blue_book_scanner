INTELLIGENCE OFFICER 26 NORAD A/D. INFORMATION FROM RED BLUFF AFS STATED THAT THERE WERE
NO BALLOON RELEASES BY DET 3, OFFICE OF AEROSPACE
RESEARCH, CAMBRIA RESEARCH LABORATORIES, CHICO,
CALIF. AT THE TIME THE OBJECT WAS SPOTTED, THE FAA
REPRESENTATIVE, MR WISE, REQUESTED A RADAR FIX BY
THE 839 RADAR SQ., RED BLUFF AFS, CALIF. THIS WAS
ACCOMPLISHED WITH RANGE AND HEIGHT FINDER RADARS. 
THE RADAR THEN REVERTED BACK TO SAGE OPERATION
AND DID NOT TRACK THE OBJECT. IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT
THIS OBJECT WAS THE AEROLOGICAL BALLOON THAT WAS
SHOT DOWN 20 APRIL, HOWEVER, THIS POSSIBILITY DOES
EXIST. NO OTHER ANALYSIS IS OFFERED AS TO CAUSE.
