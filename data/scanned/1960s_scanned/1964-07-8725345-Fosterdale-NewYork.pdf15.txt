August 29, 1964
On this date I had called the air base in advance to announce my intention to fly over three different observed UFO appearances at approximately 2200-2230 hours. I was authorized to proceed from a base and the flight plan was filed accordingly. 
As I flew an observation course, I observed three different objects for periods up to 20 minutes. The first one (A) appeared as a bright star-like source which held its position and then its light blinked off and on, as if someone had turned the light off and on again. This object held a steady position and did not appear to move.
The second one (B) was an object about the size of a small aircraft and had a pearly color. It was at an estimate of 2,000 feet altitude. This object remained stationary for about 30 minutes and then suddenly disappeared. The third object (C) was a larger object and did not remain stationary, but traveled from the southeast to the northwest at a speed estimated at 500-600 mph. I estimate the object was about 10,000 feet in altitude. 
I was most impressed with the deliberate manner in which these objects maneuvered. They all acted in a very intelligent and purposeful fashion and their performance was such that it could not be explained by any known aircraft. I am quite certain that these were not conventional aircraft nor any known space vehicles. While I may have misinterpreted some of the details, I am sure that the objects seen were of an unusual and unidentified character.
