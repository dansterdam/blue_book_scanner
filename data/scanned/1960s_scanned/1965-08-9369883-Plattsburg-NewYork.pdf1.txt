11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
GCA radar experienced indications of an a/c visual contact with the object for a period consistent with the duration of visual observation. Object maneuvered, moving higher and lower, altering course as it was observed. Disappearance of the object may have been due to its loss in the clutter returns at 1 to 2 miles. Other tracks included a circle with 1/2 mile radius. Items were high speed at 3-5 miles. After circling for 2 minutes the object flew away to the west at high speed, flight consistent with a/c on a gunnery mission.
