The image does not contain any photographs. It is a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a form or questionnaire with instructions and illustrations.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it.

28. Draw a pier, that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

No more. 

I do not see any human faces in the image, so I will not describe or name any individuals. I have simply extracted the text from the document as requested.
