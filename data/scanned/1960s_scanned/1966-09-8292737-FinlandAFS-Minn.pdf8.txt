REPLY TO 
ATTN OF:  TDEER/Mr. Bryant/pk/70401

SUBJECT:  UFO Evaluation  

TO:       TDETR (Maj Quintanilla)

1.  The comment of the 29 NORAD Div Intelligence Officer, paragraph 3, 
    dis-CUSS Div IV-l letter 167 Sep 66, indicating the concurred 
    with this UFO Report.

2.  The UFO Report, 19 Sep 66, attached to the above referenced letter, 
    states that the "return moved away" from the two F-89 interceptors
    when they approached the object. According to the clouds, it would appear 
    almost impossible for the pilots to have not observed the target
    visually since the clouds were reasonably clear. There is no 
    estimation of the size of the "target" or "moving" jet clouds.

3.  The slight temperature inversions mentioned may have caused erratic
    and unpredictable radar returns. The fact that cluster on the height
    finder extended to 30,000 feet altitude at ranges from 13 to 24 miles
    suggests such a condition. Figure 220, Volume 2, FIST photograph of
    a height finder scope with clutter caused by anomalous propagation.
    (This appears to support graphically the conditions described.)

4.  The movement or "flitting around" of the target, always on the
    270- azimuth, suggests the conditions of a fixed ground target, due or
    course to anomalous propagation.

5.  Lacking more complete details, it is not possible to give a more
    definite conclusion as to the radar report and confirming visual
    sighting. The height and airspeed of the target appears to rule out the 
    usual types of aircraft, unless the height/speed does not designate the
    object as that location.
