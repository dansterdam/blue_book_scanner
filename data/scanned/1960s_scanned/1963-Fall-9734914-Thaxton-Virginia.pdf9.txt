Right to the air wave for November 1, 1963 
Information, SAFH-PB
Wilmington, Del.

My dear sir:
On October 3, 1963 I was sick in bed, 12 y+8 M old, 5 feet 11 inches weighing 220 Ibs. The 0 air time. 9:00 a.m. 9:20 a.m. my TV set operate ABNORMALLY WELL. True it was that I have been 117 days away END. 24 years since I was. 
Station air, AP radio news and WELM Wilmington local newscast, within 5 minutes 3 events unrelated happened all similer, in EVERY DETAIL.
There was in reality an Air Force maneuver over many farm fields in Brandywine Hundred, Del. 

Where I may a sketch Air Force activities over my farm field. This is a TRUE statement, on U.F.O. U.F.O. the term "unidentified flying object" is not properly USed for this incident. Suffice it to say, that I observed a LIGHTED craft, that was ROUND DISCOID SHAPED, no portholes or openings, that hovered at 150 to 200 feet above the ground and was ILLUMINATED. This craft seem to be operating by SOUNDLESS POWER.
I watched this CRAFT, (which did make no engine SOUND WHAT SO EVER) for about 30 minutes, Estimating its diameter to approximately 60 to 70 feet. When it was leaving, it moved in a southeasterly direction, the LIGHTING going out COMPLETELY and it disappeared at a high rate of speed and altitude, like a FALLING STAR. 
I definitely believe here was a scientific experiment or MANIFESTATION performed over my farm on Oct. 3, 1963. There were no unusual happenings when it departed. The very next day, Oct. 4, 1963, I informed the U.S.F.O. Headquarters at Andrews A.F.B.
