They noticed a bright light in the sky to the north which appeared to be moving erratically. They watched the light for about 5 minutes when it suddenly disappeared.
Upon arriving home, they reported the incident to the local police. An officer responded and proceeded with the witnesses to the area where the light had been seen. A search was conducted but no physical evidence was found.
