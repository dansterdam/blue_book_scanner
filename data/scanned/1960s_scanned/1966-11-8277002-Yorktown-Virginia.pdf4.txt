II. Meteorological Activity:
Radar activity in the area of the sighting was probably increased due to the changing weather conditions. The wind speed and direction as recorded by the Yorktown Naval Weapons Station was 17 knots from 050 (approx. 330 degrees) at the time of the sighting. A colliding front was moving in, causing considerable haze and poor visibility. Travel was difficult and more hazardous than normal.

III. Air Traffic:
High performance, single-engine jet traffic is very dense in the Langley Air Force Base/Oceana Naval Air Station areas. On a clear night the jet aircraft noises can often be mistaken for unexplained light phenomena.

This report was prepared by Captain Robert K. Germann, 4509 Air Base Wing (ADC) on 8 November 1966. Further details were gathered in a personal interview with airmen who apparently observed the object. The interview confirmed the report, particularly the statements regarding the jet aircraft noises which easily explain the sightings. It was also learned that what the witness may have seen a "shooting star" is also stated that he was surprised that the light (sic) were only visible for a short time, probably a meteor. It could also have been the tail-pipe exhaust or afterburner fire of a jet aircraft.
