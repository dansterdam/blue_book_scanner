railroad tracks, and the other witnesses said nothing about having heard anything.

The location where the police car had been with its siren on, the night of the sighting, was described as "one-half mile north" of the residence. However, the residence is about one-half mile west of the highway, so that the total distance is closer to three-quarters of a mile. Also the highway goes through a deep cut and is generally 50 feet or more below the level of the hill on which the residence is located. It is possible that sound propagation depends heavily on weather conditions. It is hard to reconcile the outcome of the experiment, however, with the description of the sound as being so loud that the witnesses had to cover their ears.

The boys described the light they saw as being bluish; this could possibly be tied to the blue rotating light on the state patrol car. The description indicates, however, of a brilliant spotlight having the color and brightness of a welder's arc. This light is not consistent with the idea that it was reflected light caused by the impression, or that of his headlights. The line of sight given by the witnesses at the house barely (possibly) have passed closer to the road than one-half mile, so that the location of the house from the highway remains a further investigation.

Further investigation, it appears now that what the boys saw and heard could be ascribed to the police car; the sound to its siren, and the moving bluish light to the light from the rotating blue light of the state patrol car.
