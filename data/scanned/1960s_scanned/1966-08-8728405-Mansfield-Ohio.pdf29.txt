The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed text document describing a UFO sighting.

(from the West, after a pattern turn) the object began to change shape; first it became egg-shaped (long axis vertical), then like a column of smoke, with the base at slight altitude, then becoming sharpened shape with the angle pointed east. It then faded out. This report has been given to Truax Field, and Mr. [ ] has filled out a form and sent it in. Landed at 12:45.
