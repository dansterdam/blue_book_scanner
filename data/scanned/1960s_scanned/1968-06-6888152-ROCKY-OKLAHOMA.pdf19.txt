1. Under the provisions of AFR 80-17, Investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects, a report was made on 19 June 1968, at Clinton Sherman AFB and 4 miles South & 2 miles East of Clin ton Oklahoma by Captain S. Leonard Jr., 70th Bomb Wing SAC (DOGO) Clinton Sherman AFB, Oklahoma 73632, to examine all aspects of the allegation made by 2 Farm Hands that a UFO was sighted by them at approximately 0630 hours, 19 June 1968.

2. The investigation is accompanied by pictures, letters of certification and AFR 80-17 (Gl) questionnaires, on sighting of unidentified phenomena from personnel investigative of the 2 farm hands by Captain Leonard, at the sight of the phenomena. A radioactivity check was made in the area with negative results.

3. Conclusions reached by my limited knowledge in this investigation are inconclusive. The only determination of cause I would suggest is a conclusion of that weather and a probable object from course route by the area.
