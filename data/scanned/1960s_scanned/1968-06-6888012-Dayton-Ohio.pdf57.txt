The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing text describing the results of an X-ray diffraction analysis on a metallic sample from an unidentified aerial object.

The text in the document states:

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the metallic portion of the sample was interpreted as representing diffractions from the following compounds:

1) Predominant constituent: face-centered cubic compound with unit-cell dimension, a = 3.62A approximately; corresponds to a gamma-iron solid solution as found in austenitic steel (austenite), e.g. nickel-bearing and manganese-bearing types, and to meteoric iron (taenite).

2) trace constituents: quartz and calcite.

The X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the small amounts of not-well-known material on the surface of the aerial object was essentially as follows:
