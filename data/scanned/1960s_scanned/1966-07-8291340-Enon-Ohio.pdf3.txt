The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram, but does not contain any photographs. The text indicates that the image is from a Project Blue Book document related to a UFO sighting in Enon, Ohio in 1966.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass when you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
