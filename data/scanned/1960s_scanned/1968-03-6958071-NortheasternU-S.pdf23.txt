Dear Sir:

I am writing this letter in regards to the satellite that was seen on March 3, 1968, around 9 P.M.

On that date, I saw something in the sky that looked like a ball of fire. As I was watching, it broke into three different parts, each part disappearing at different times. I'd say that there was approximately three to four seconds between the disappearance of each (this is a rough estimation). One part could be seen longer than the others, but I can't tell you if it also died out or not. I did not hear anything like a clap of thunder.

If I can be of further help, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
[Redacted], Pennsylvania
