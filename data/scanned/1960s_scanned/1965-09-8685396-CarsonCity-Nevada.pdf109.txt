Virgence Staffs Plagued by 'Objects' for 20 Years
Seven former military jet pilots, who prepared training flights, have been plagued by strange phenomena first experienced in 1945. Strange lights flashing, all have red left winking, green right warning lights, and white tail lights, and most have the orange-red flashing anticollision lights above and below the tail light. As these military jets and airliners pass overhead, the sighting relative position of the ground objects remains unchanged, and the strange light phenomena do not change in sequence or intensity. The article describes these strange light phenomena as a potential threat to aviation safety.
View's Range 12-20 Minutes
The article states that as recorded, these satellites are in view from 12 to 20 minutes. Since observers have noted that this point, one or another of these strange objects normally appears.
