To my fellow earthmen,
This sighting by the witnesses Connerville Landing shock ne up somewhat. The pesky little boogers got away with it so nicely. No more saw them than I did - but I know that when another so called air force spokes-man state air security crashed out "unidentif-ied aircraft over our Thule Radar on Christmas eve" all tho enclosed are all my sightings that amount to much except one checked for fact or fiction, I have identified about 15 of these as hot air balloons or nothing more than cars. Since I hope something more is secured to limit information of witness unreliabiliit, I have been busy for four months) I hope something more is secured to limit this "under the radar" vest.
It looks like its cowooys and Indians all over again--this time your under the radar vest.
