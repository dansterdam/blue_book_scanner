Dear Mr. & Mrs. [REDACTED],
Thank you for your letter of June 15. I have no idea what it was you said you have given no few facts. In the first place, I do not in any sense believe that you saw a dirigible. I do not believe it was any form of a ship. It had nothing whatever to do with Cape Kennedy I am sure. And again I am quite sure that the ship does not come from outer space. My only point in writing you is to try to find out whether indeed you really saw something. And indeed, what kind of stimulus it was that provoked your reaction.
I am well aware of the mythical air ships of 1895-97. And indeed your description fits the recitals that I feel there is definitely some sort of relationship. I have discussed these sightings in books, "Flying saucers" published by the Harvard University Press in 1953, and in "The World of Flying Saucers" by Donald H. Menzel and Lyle G. Boyd, published by Doubleday. The second one is still in print and available at your bookstores. It is second one that may be of greatest interest to you and available in print and available in print.
Your descriptions are too detailed, too pat. If something of this sort had been in the area we should have had hundreds of reports, not just a few. 
We do not know whether the sky was clear or cloudy or many other things. One explanation that occurs to my mind is that a bright searchlight on clouds might have produced something similar to what you reported.
Sincerely yours,
Donald H. Menzel
