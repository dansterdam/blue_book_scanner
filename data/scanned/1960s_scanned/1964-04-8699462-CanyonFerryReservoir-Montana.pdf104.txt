there are boys who have electronics experience or walkie-talkies. perhaps the electrical antennae or dials will be the vital region, looking for trace elements, to see if there is evidence of burned gunpowder? Or there is a char charred material on the bushes. See if these may have some evidence of some constituent of gunpowder? Perhaps some unburned nitrate? bat it was just a CO bomb? as I have suggested, perhaps that is harder to detect.

Given the much of a clue.  we must act the event.  It may be difficult because one canno equal the meteorological conditions.

Watched as these hypotheses are with you would, I look that we are sure constipated. any day in our receiving. I will recall that Handin of and the G-2 Polish official, both knowed, came from a field of medium by, producing, by entirely natural means, the phenomena in the field of defense of the county. I bring you the same.

Looking forward to hearing from you and with our very best regards, we are.

Cordially yours,
