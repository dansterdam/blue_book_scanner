There is no photograph contained in the image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a record of the U.S. Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

The text in the document reads as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Dear [Redacted],

Reference is made to your letter of 17 May 1961, in which you inquire about a report of an unidentified flying object (UFO) observed in your area on 8 May 1961.

The description sounds very much like what is known as a bolide, or a very bright meteor. Your description of its almost instant disappearance is typical of a bolide, which burns up completely in the earth's atmosphere and leaves no remnants. Such occurrences are common and are usually explainable as natural phenomena.

If you have any further questions, please let me know.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
