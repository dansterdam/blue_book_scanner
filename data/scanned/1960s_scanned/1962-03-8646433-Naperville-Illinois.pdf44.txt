16. Detailed Description of Sighting:

At approximately 7:30 on the evening of March 8, 1962, my wife and I were in our backyard when we observed a bright light in the northern sky. The light appeared to be moving in a northeasterly direction at a rather rapid speed. As it approached our position, we could see that it was a disc-shaped object with a glow around the edge. The object appeared to change direction several times and then disappeared from view. The total time of observation was approximately 5 minutes.

The object did not appear to be making any sound and seemed to accelerate and decelerate rather rapidly. There were no known aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.
