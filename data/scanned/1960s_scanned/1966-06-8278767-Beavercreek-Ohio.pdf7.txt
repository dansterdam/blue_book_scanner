The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on a document.

Concerning your question on this, I saw another flash of light about a mile to the north northeast at the same spot. The object appeared to be hanging motionless for 3 minutes or so in a brilliant light. Apparently it went off in the same direction It had come but at a much higher speed and seemed to slowly disappear in the distance.

I have told you of everything I have seen concerning this. Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you,
