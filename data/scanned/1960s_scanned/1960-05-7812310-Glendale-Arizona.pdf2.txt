After watching this strange whirlwind, he observed a white object come in over the Dust Devil at a very high rate of speed. He was sure it was something else. At first he thought it to be some object picked up by the wind. However, when the object continued to travel on a straight course at a very high rate of speed, he was sure it was something else.
