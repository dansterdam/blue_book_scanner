The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a table titled "Project Mercury Major Rocket Tests" that lists various booster vehicles, their objectives, and the purpose of the tests.

PROJECT MERCURY
Project Mercury is now 2 1/4 years old. Since its inception, an extensive series of ground and flight test programs has been carried out, involving hundreds of wind tunnel and airplane drop tests and 15 successful major orbital flight tests. These have provided valuable information contributing to the development of a completely new and reliable system for manned space flight.

The Mercury Project has survived a number of problems and setbacks, but it has successfully matched major milestones one by one. Close cooperation between industrial associates, government agencies, and tracking stations is nearing completion. Table III contains the current planning, level requirements for the worldwide tracking and communications network.
