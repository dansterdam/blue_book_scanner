Transcription of the text in the document:

Unidentified UFO Sighting
Marimonnet) The name of the cameraman was probably invented.

Carol and Jim Donegan of the Garland (Illinois) Research of (Palo Alto, California) were apparently doing some diving on the Caloosahatchee River. They took some very good pictures of this UFO sighting.

They said the object was hovering for a fairly long period, probably 3 to 5 minutes, and then accelerated straight up and out of sight at a very high rate of speed. There was no sound and no visible means of propulsion. The object was disc-shaped and very metallic in appearance.

I have made several inquiries of the US Government agencies dealing with UFO's and have not been able to find any factual information on this sighting. I would appreciate your checking your files and see if you have any information. More detailed and accurate information on this sighting would be most helpful.
