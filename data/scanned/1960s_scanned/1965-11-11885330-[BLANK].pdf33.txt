Text from the document:

only a portion of the observed events, and even those which are characterized by the fireball hypothesis show deviations. One such deviation is the frequent appearance of a pion which accompanies one of the nucleons after the interaction. This pion is thought to be the decay product of a nucleon resonance produced in the interaction. There is clearly a great deal yet to be learned about the interaction mechanism for proton-proton collisions in the 1,000 BeV energy region. The above paragraphs serve to suggest that the present proposal would allow an analysis of cosmic ray events along conventional lines, but with far more precise information about each interaction, which could be used to test the several existing models for cosmic ray interactions. In addition, there are numerous other experiments proposed for super-high energy accelerators that would also apply to balloon experiments. (1) More than likely, this would be merely a starting point, and the ability to examine events in detail not previously available in a relatively unexplored energy range would bring to light new phenomena requiring further investigation.

IV. Experimental Techniques and Design of the Experiment
The experiment we propose to build is a complex undertaking and has a strong developmental aspect; inasmuch as some of the techniques planned for it are novel and some of its components will have to be carefully designed and modeled in prototype. In this section we describe the elements of the experiment and examine the pertinent developmental problems of each from the standpoint of physical and engineering plausibility. The design we present is by no means a final one, but shows that it is possible to meet the experimental criteria within the weight and environmental constraints. Although it will be necessary and desirable to make use of computer solutions in the final design, we believe that such a study will present no essentially new results to the analysis presented here.
