PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 11 Jan 61
2. LOCATION: Wichita Falls, Texas
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2315
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: Yes
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 min
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The object was apparently in view during the early afternoon, but no one else saw it until the observer and his wife saw it at around 2315 hours. This object was circular in shape, was bluish-green in color, and was observed for about 30 minutes. The object moved very slowly, almost imperceptibly, during the early afternoon, but was motionless during the time it was observed by the observer and his wife. No sound was heard. Newspapers reported a sighting which could have been the same object, but due to there being one witness, the report remains partially unresolved.
13. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient Data to Evaluate
