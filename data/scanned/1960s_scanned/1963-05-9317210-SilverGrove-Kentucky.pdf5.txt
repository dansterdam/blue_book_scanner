20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
A/////  >->->  /C

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
About the size of a quarter at full arm's length.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
1/2

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It dimmed and faded from view.

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a type of object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
About the size of a quarter, bright white light, slightly elongated, with no wings or other detail visible. It moved smoothly and silently across the sky.
