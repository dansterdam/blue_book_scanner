A. SUBJECTI RICHARD S GIROUX SAW STRANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY. 
WHAT FOLLOWS IS RICHARD S GIROUX'S ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE SAW:

ON 1964 AUG 2 AT 0030 HOURS I SAW LIGHTS SICXLY CITY APPROACHING ME AND COMING TOWARD ME. THEY WERE QUITE CLOSE AND THEY WERE RED AND GREEN AND BLUE. THEY WERE ROUND LIGHTS AND THEY WERE SO CLOSE THAT I COULD MAKE OUT THEIR DETAILS DISTINCTLY. THEY WERE MANEUVERING VERY RAPIDLY. 
I RAN TO GET MY WIFE TO LOOK AT THEM AND SHE SAW THEM ALSO. THEY WERE ABOUT 1000 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND ABOUT 500 FEET FROM ME AT THEIR CLOSEST POINT. 
THEY WERE MANEUVERING VERY RAPIDLY AND THEN THEY SHOT OFF AT TREMENDOUS SPEED AND DISAPPEARED. I WOULD ESTIMATE THEIR SPEED AS BEING APPROXIMATELY 1000 MILES PER HOUR. I COULD SEE NO WINGS OR EXHAUST AND THERE WAS NO SOUND. IT WAS A VERY STRANGE EXPERIENCE AND I AM POSITIVE OF WHAT I SAW EVEN THOUGH OTHERS IN THE AREA DID NOT SEE IT.
