METHODS OF DETERMINING MILITARY DEVICE ANGLE  
FOR ELEVATIONS A, B, AND C, PAGE 17 OF REPORT:

Situation a: Witnesses at the Garden Court Apartments (location C map page 15) observed object (page 1 and 2). Observers indicated position of object in sky, relative to buildings.

Situation b: A group of people (location B map page 15) observed red light, approximately 15 degrees from the horizon.

These two independent groups observed flashes, explosion and mushroom cloud approximately 11:52 p.m. 2/5/60.

Plotting this information on map (U.S. Geological Survey Map, the location indicated by witnesses) the intersection of sun's elevated trajectory (11:57 p.m. 2/5/60) was the observation of Sunset.

Section 3: The ninety degree angle shown to correspond by the observers to the object's apparent size, suggests an altitude approximately 26,000 feet.

Section 4: Police officer at Police station, Wilcox and De Lancy (location B map page 15) observed red light, azimuth given 345 degrees (true north).

Witnesses at Curran and Hollywood Boulevard (location F map page 15) observed red light, using celestial navigation as reference point.

These two independent groups observed the red light at the same time, as it hovered (Point C map page 15) and watched final take off.

Plotting this information on the U.S. Geological Survey Map, the lines intersect at a point over the Hollywood Freeway.
