The sky was clear and the moon shone brightly on the  night of September 8, 1960, in Akron, Ohio. At approximately  11:20 p.m., the witness, a man, was looking out of a window  in his apartment when he noticed an unusual object in the sky. 
The object appeared to be elongated in shape and was accompanied  by a trail of white lights. It moved slowly across the sky in a straight line  before disappearing from view. The witness reported the incident to the  police, who in turn, notified the Air Force. An investigation was conducted,  but no explanation for the sighting could be determined.
