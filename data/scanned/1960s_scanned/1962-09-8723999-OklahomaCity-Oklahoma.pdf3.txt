To Norton it may concern,
Briefly - Enclosed is a case of unusual things which a city official of Oklahoma City witnessed and was able to verify with another witness.
On Sept 7, 1962 at about 10:35 PM, two city officials were driving near the city limits when they observed a bright light moving rapidly overhead at an elevation of about 2000 feet. They watched it for about a minute as it moved west at an estimated speed of 500 mph. This was not a conventional aircraft, but a round, disc-shaped object about 20-25 feet in diameter, glowing with a whitish light. Both officials observed the object, and felt this was a unusual observation worth reporting.
No significant effect or evidence was left behind, other than their account. They felt this was a definitely an unconcerned object, possibly of mechanical origin, that warranted further investigative attention. As a city official, I felt this case merited being called to your attention.
Respectfully yours,
