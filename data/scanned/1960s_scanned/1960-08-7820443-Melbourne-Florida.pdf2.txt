Police had called the Duty Officer of Oceana Naval Air Station Saturday night (13 Aug) and reported an unidentified object had been sighted and recovered. The object was then transported from the Langley AFB area to the Security Police Maintenance Area.

This party departed Norfolk Naval Air Station the Sunday morning (14 Aug) consisting of Sgt. Stein, A02/C Bennett, and AM2 Semanski. They proceeded by car and jeep to Langley AFB, Va. where they were met by State Police officers. The party was then escorted to the Security Police Maintenance Area at Langley AFB, Va. and traveled another 5 miles to the right on Ft. Eustis. (Lt.

Johnson further stated that detectors were attached to the object and that pictures had been taken of the object. However, the investigating party was unable to obtain the photos or the detectors used on this object.
