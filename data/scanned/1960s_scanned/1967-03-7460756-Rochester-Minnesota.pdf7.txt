Local Lad Photographs
A Nearby Flying Object

By JOHN NOVOTNEY
If "don't really believes in flying saucers, there is at least one local youth who can't doubt their possible existence.
Mark Ifrtchitz, 12, son of Mr. and Mrs. Dick Ifrtchitz, 3144 3rd Ave. NE, made the remark after sighting the peculiar object.
They are the first reported observers in the Rochester district to get a photograph of what appears to be a flying saucer.
Mark said he looked out the window of the family home at about 5:15 on a Sunday evening and "just happened to see this thing there."
"We thought at first it was a plane, but it didn't move like an airplane and it stayed there for quite awhile." Mark said.
The object was over the street when he first saw it, but moved over the streets a little more and then "just shot up and out of sight."
Most of the boy's classmates at Washington Junior High School saw the object, "and they are really shocked at what we were able to photograph," he said.
