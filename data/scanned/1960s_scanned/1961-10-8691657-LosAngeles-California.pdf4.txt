38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
It was a very strange sight. I have no idea what it could have been. It was neither an airplane nor a helicopter and it was something I have never seen before or since. It just seems to hang in the air and move very fast and also it had some running lights on it. My opinion is that it is some kind of secret test craft from some government or private research organization but I don't know for sure just what it could have been.
