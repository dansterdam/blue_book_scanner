My Dad, an aeronautical engineer, , an engineering student going to Cornell University, and myself were having a family picnic at Lone Pine, California. This was around 1:30 p.m. when we sighted an unusual object. 

The object appeared to be a jet airplane going maneuvers - but it's speed and maneuvers were so great that we thought they would tear the plane apart. It was traveling at a terrific rate of speed - back and forth - up and down - weaving in and out of the mountains. It would disappear completely and then reappear a half mile away in a split second. The object seemed to have shot out of whatever it was doing - and would come back to the original spot the same way. 

At times it would appear to stop completely - then dart off at tremendous speeds. The object seemed to have shot out of some lower altitude cloud bank and return diving back into the same cloud bank - moving in an up and down and back and forth pattern. It was making very sharp impossible turns. The whole performance lasted for about 10 to 15 minutes and was completely out of the ordinary.
