The object was round and appeared to be rotating at a high speed. It was traveling in an erratic course, making sharp turns and changing directions rapidly. It appeared to be under intelligent control, the motion was too precise to be a natural object. It had a steady glow, not flashing, and no sound was heard. It was visible for about 5 minutes. It seemed to come from the Northwest and traveled Southwest. We were watching a meteor shower at the time, and this object seemed to be much closer and of a different nature. Nothing familiar, no aircraft or satellite. A weather balloon or some natural explanation seems unlikely. This was an unusual and impressive sight.
