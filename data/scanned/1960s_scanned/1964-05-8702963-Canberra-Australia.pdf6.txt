Another unusual incident, subject of an official State Department report, occurred on May 7, 1964, at Canberra, Australia. Just before dawn, several ground observers near Canberra saw a large white-glowing object traveling northeast across the dark sky. It moved with an odd wobble as though losing power, or partly out of control. Then the observers saw a smaller object, visible with a faint red light, hovering ahead. The large white device flew straight toward the small UFO and appeared to strike it, bouncing back. Then the large UFO turned, no longer wobbling, and raced out of sight. The small red light sputtered and then disappeared. (It has been suggested that this could have been some unknown type of refueling or recharging process.)

The observers' report was investigated by the Scientific Attache of the American Embassy at Canberra, Dr. Paul Siple, and by two NASA engineers. They concluded that the objects were not any known earthmade craft and they had no explanation for the sighting. The report was sent via Airfram A-894 to the State Department, which forwarded copies to the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, NASA, the Army and the Navy.
