The image appears to contain a schematic or map-like diagram, but there is no photograph present. The diagram seems to depict some kind of topographical or hydrographical information, with labels indicating "HIGH" and "LOW" areas.

As an OCR system, I will now attempt to extract all the text found in the document:

HIGH
LOW
RUSH
LOW
