Proposed reply to letter from Mr. August 22, 1957

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Thank you for your report of the unidentified flying object that you observed in November 1966. Although a scientific investigation would be impossible to conduct at this time, your report will be retained as part of our data base. If you are fortunate enough to observe another unidentified flying object, please contact the nearest Air Force base immediately, for they are in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.
