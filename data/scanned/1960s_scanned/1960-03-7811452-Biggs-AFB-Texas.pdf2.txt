ACTIVITY OF AERIAL PHENOMENA RESEARCH ORGANIZATION

1. Reference attached copy of a letter from the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization to Major Lawrence J. Tacker, dated 18 April 1960.

2. The Aerial Phenomena Research Organization has not been included in the selection of certain ATIC/UFOB Liaison Officers. It is hoped this can be remedied.

3. It should be noted that APRO is converting the meaning dated 11 September 1959, particularly paragraphs 5i and 5j, to our knowledge the information claimed by APRO has not been verified.

4. On 25 March 1960, at 18:25 (6:25 p.m.), a flying object was observed by several reliable witnesses and as described varied reports received by ATIC. The witnesses described the object as glowing, bluish-white in color, and moving at very high speed. The witnesses all agree the object was travelling in a generally east to west direction, and disappeared below the trees or mountain.

5. For your information this sighting was classified confidential under the category of "Unknowns" and retained in the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) files.
