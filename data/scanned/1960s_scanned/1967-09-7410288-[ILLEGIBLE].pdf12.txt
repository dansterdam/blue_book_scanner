Dear Major:  

In reference to your request for comments on the observation of Catherine Manter made on 2 September 1967, at Boulder, Colorado, the evidence strongly points to the planet Saturn as the stimulus. The planet Saturn would be quite bright, but would not twinkle.  

The fact that the object was in view for one hour and forty-five minutes, appeared as a star but with its light steady and clear, leads me to consider Saturn to be the stimulus for this observation. According to the well-known phenomena which arises from observing, nothing is said of the magnitude of the object, and only an obscured consideration of the well-known influence which arises from observing.  

The report has several minor inconsistencies in it but, all in all, it is nothing in the report that would seriously contradict the conclusion that the planet Saturn was the stimulus. The statement that the elevation was approximately 30 degrees, if believed, would, I believe, confirm the general tendency of people to estimate horizontal angles greater than they actually are.  

Sincerely yours,  
J. Allen Hynek
