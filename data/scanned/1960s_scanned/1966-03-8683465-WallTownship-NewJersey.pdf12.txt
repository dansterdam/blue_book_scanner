The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is a letter from the Chief, Civil Branch, Community Relations Division of the Office of Information, addressed to "Mr. ___", forwarding a UFO report and negatives for analysis.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr. ____,

Your letter to the Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base forwarding a UFO report and negatives has been referred to this office for reply. Project Blue Book, the Air Force UFO program, has evaluated the photos taken by Mr. _____ on ________ and negatives are enclosed and we would appreciate your returning them to Mr. _____.

Information for a more detailed analysis would include focal length of the camera and lens data. Due to having only the front position available, a check was made of local sources to determine the focal length. We found no such camera, but a check of this type normally would be standard procedure to establish the focal length.

Further analysis would require reliable estimates of distance parameters to the object (range) for each photograph and exact focal length of the camera.

In view of the foregoing, we have placed your report in our Unidentifiable Data Category. Reports containing such as this are those for which one or more elements of information essential for evaluation are missing.

Thank you for your interest in our program.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. PEDERAL, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
