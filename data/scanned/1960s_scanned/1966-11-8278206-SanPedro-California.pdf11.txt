REPORT OF INVESTIGATION SUBMITTED THRU CHANNELS

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING - Beverly, Massachusetts - 11/15/66

ATTENTION: Richard Hall, Assistant Director
SIGHTING BACKGROUND: 
I met Dr. Richard Symmes after lecturing to a group at the First Unitarian Church in Beverly, Massachusetts on 11/15/66. Dr. Symmes dispatched investigator George Skypeck to interview me re: a sighting of a strange object they had made the previous night. This object was tracked on RADAR 17:55 and sighted near the Beverly area about six miles away from them in the Northwest. The object was about the size of a full moon and appeared glow with a yellow-orange colored light around the periphery. It made some jerking motions and then while looking away, the object apparently vanished.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT: 
Dr. Symmes and Mr. Burkes were hunting duck in a small boat off the direction of Beverly shortly after 5:30 PM when they noticed a strange object in the sky some six miles away in the Northwest. The object was about the size of the full moon and appeared to glow with a yellow-orange colored light around the periphery. It made some jerking motions and then while looking away, the object apparently vanished.

EVALUATION:
It is hard to say just what was observed. Neither observer was able to determine the distance or size of the object, which would have moved quite a distance in fifteen minutes if the lower of the distance estimates is correct. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that this sighting involved an extraterrestrial vehicle. The object appeared and disappeared in a manner which suggests that it was some natural phenomenon the nature of which is not clear from the information received for this time and date.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler
