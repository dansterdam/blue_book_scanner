The brief summary and analysis states that the observers were watching TV when a loud noise was heard outside their house. They rushed outside and observed an object traveling slowly, almost east to west on a very slight southward course. The object was reported to have had various colors. One witness said the object looked like a star and was moving very fast. Another said it looked like a "white ball of fire". Still another said the object was flashing; very low and had red and blue lights. The red light was blinking off and on. The object was described as larger than a shooting star in one case and as a star-like object in another. The data is inconsistent in several ways, particularly in color of the object and the description of the object.
