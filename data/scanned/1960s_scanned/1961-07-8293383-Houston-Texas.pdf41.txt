THE REPORT/GIR MOODY

I do not think this is actually a strange sighting. The reported radar/visual sighting may have been caused by terrestrial aircraft. I do not think this is a case of detection of foreign/extraterrestrial vehicles at this time. I respectfully assume that either or of these is the bright target acquired visually.
