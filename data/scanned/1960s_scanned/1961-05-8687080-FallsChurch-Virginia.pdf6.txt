The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet used for recording details about a reported event.

U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filled and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write as complete a description of the event that you observed. You may use your observations that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments. If more space is needed, additional pages of the same size paper may be attached.

There is handwritten text that fills the remainder of the document, describing the reported event. As an OCR system, I will transcribe this text verbatim:

On a gentle incline area southwest of Falls Church, Virginia, at least 33 resident witnesses observed a strange aerial object described as very bright, elliptical, and about the size of a Cessna aircraft at an estimated altitude of 800 to 1000 feet. The object remained motionless for several minutes and then accelerated at very high speed and disappeared to the south. Some witnesses estimated the speed to be in excess of 2000 mph. The object was reported to have no wings, fins, or any other visible appendages. It was observed over an area of approximately one mile and was estimated to have been in view for about 5 minutes.
