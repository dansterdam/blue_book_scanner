The image appears to contain a compass rose diagram in the center and two sketches below it. The compass rose diagram indicates different cardinal directions and is accompanied by a note instructing the reader to "place an 'X' on the compass to indicate the direction to the object." 

The sketch on the left appears to depict a wide landscape view with a human figure standing in the center. The sketch on the right shows a close-up view of a similar landscape with some cloud formations.

OCR Text:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE . PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE OBJECT WHEN FIRST SEEN . PLACE A "P" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE OBJECT APPEARED TO MOVE .

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "P" AT THE POSITION TO WHICH IT APPEARED TO MOVE. CONNECT THE "X" AND "P" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE PATH OF THE OBJECT. AS SMALL SKETCHES OR ZIG-ZAG LINES CAN HELP EXPLAIN THE OBSERVED MOTION, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
