Crescent Over Hawaii

On the night of March 11, 1963, a crescent-shaped object passed over the area north of the island of Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands. It was traveling at a very high altitude and was very bright and some observers said it left a trail of fire and appeared to fall into the sea.

Two Hawaii Air National Guard pilots, while flying at 40,000 feet, saw the object and Capt. Jon Parish said he felt the object was some type of rocket or space object flying at a tremendous speed. The object appeared to be very small, like a missile flying at a very high altitude.

Ground observers and military officials said hundreds of other people saw the object and military officials would provide no explanation.
