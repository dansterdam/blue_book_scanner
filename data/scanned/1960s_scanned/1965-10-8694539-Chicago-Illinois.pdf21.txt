This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document page from Project Blue Book, containing various notes, sketches, and annotations.

Extracted text from the document:

Saw that when turning
I thought I saw a fog
Vehicle on mountain.
Looked to assist and
found to be illuminating
and gradually stopping
Exhibit 2-complete and
detail of first approach
and later very brightness
must have scared me.
