Dear Miss _____,
This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you could not identify on the night of 6 March 1965.

Your description of the object, its flight characteristics, and the duration of two to three seconds are in accordance with reports of a similar object observed that night, which was faster and smaller than a fireball and was lower in altitude than you observers which you have previously observed.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
