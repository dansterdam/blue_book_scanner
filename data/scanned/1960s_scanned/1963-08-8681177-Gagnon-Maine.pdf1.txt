The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, specifically a "Project 10073 Record Card" dated August 1, 1963. The report describes an observation of an "Elongated (2ft x 10 inch) red flashing object" near Caribou, Maine, which was observed in level flight from East to West during the day. The report states that insufficient data is available for further evaluation.
