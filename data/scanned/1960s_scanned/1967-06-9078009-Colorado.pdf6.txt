Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text contained in the document, transcribed using OCR:

Dear ... Garden L... 

I have a a rereport of a strange object observed by his children in the town. They were outside the house and looking up saw what they described as a very bright and fast moving object which was unlike any plane or satellite they had seen before. It appeared to be about the size of a quarter held at arm's length and was very bright and moving at a tremendous rate of speed across the sky. The object was seen for only a few seconds and then disappeared. The children were very excited and frightened by what they had seen. 

What I would like to know is whether there were any UFO reports from this area on this date, and whether any other people saw the object. If so, I would appreciate any information you can give me about the sighting. Thanking you in advance,

Yours truly,
J.A. ...
