UFO SIGHTING
Observer: Mr. Gordo USA, 17 August 1962
Location: Ogden, Utah
Occupation: Union Depot Company, Ogden, Utah (for 37 years)
Time: Local 3:48 pm 17 August 1962 Length: 10 seconds
Description: Shape was difficult to define - it was a little different than that seen previously. The objects were approximately square with rounded corners. The objects were in a line, very close together, and traveling very slowly. The objects were observed for a total of approximately 10 seconds. The observer was in the yard when he saw the objects. They traveled from the northeast to the southwest. Other persons were not able to observe the objects. The observer was unable to tell whether objects were real or imaginary. The objects were lit up but with no lights. Observer said his mother-in-law might have been lighting the objects with her window shades or curtains.
WX Conditions: It was fairly light out. Stars and faint outline could be seen. The witness looked out of his watch and observed the same objects again. He again watched them for a few minutes. They completely covered the area in a few minutes and disappeared. This object was only a few hundred feet high at the most.
Optical Aid: Observer wears glasses but did not have them on at the time of the sighting. He had vision of 20-20.
