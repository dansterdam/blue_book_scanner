The brief summary and analysis indicates that the observer watched a light travel across the sky, and compared the light to an aircraft light, but concluded that it was not an aircraft because it was too high and traveling too fast. The observer stated that if it was an aircraft, they would have heard something, but they did not hear anything. The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation, and it is concluded that only a light was seen at all times.
