There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a text document, which I will now transcribe:

I thought, Well, he has a busy schedule and he obviously had to make other plans. I know university very well, and I thought, well, possibly they insisted on taking him to dinner that evening or something, and knowing that, I just excused it.

As much for that. You'll be probably somewhat disturbed to hear that the Air Force has tentatively classified - now I didn't - the Air Force tentatively identified your sighting as a hot air balloon.  

I see.

Because, now the basis for it, however, they did have some basis. It was, your Chief of Police down there, Claude E. Short, finally answered their letter. He wrote, "We are sorry that we have not answered your letter before now." However, I was absent from my desk for several weeks and upon my return I inquired about any complaints being received on any observations of this kind and received word that we did have complaints, so first off let's check what those complaints were. Upon further investigation personally it appeared that some local kids had placed a substance of some sort in a plastic bag that the cleaners use when they return garments to customers after they have been cleaned, and after inflating the garment bag in some way the substance gives a lighted effect and it floats off into the air." And this was signed...

And I even know the boys that did it.

Excuse you do?
