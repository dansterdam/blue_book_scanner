The text on the document is as follows:

Headquarters USAF
Tndex
Washington 25, D.C.
Attention: SAFOI
Dear Sirs:
Captain Moore of the USAF New Haven Office has indicated that the matter involved here was an unusual sighting of a possible unidentified flying object.
At 2:30 to 3:45 a.m. on December the 14th, the writer was proceeding from the Connecticut-Pennsylvania-New Jersey State Troopers station in Stanford, Connecticut. At that time, he noticed a very rapidly moving red light on the left horizon, traveling from northwest to southeast. To his left, rear and directly upper part of the windshield of the car, and proceeded across the center line or our vision traveling in an approximate Westerly direction.
Initially, the object glowed bright red and left a trail, then extinguished and appeared periodically as a visible luminous change was noted. Similar to a flash bulb going off, then the trail changed to a flickering glow concluding above the horizon.
The object appeared to be much closer than a normally viewed meteor or satellite. The intensity was considerably brighter than the writer had ever observed for falling stars, and the speed was faster than the writer had ever witnessed for Satellites or airplanes.
The writer would be pleased to supply any additional information he might develop and believes he could accurately pinpoint the location of the automobile to within one mile if necessary.
Very truly yours,
