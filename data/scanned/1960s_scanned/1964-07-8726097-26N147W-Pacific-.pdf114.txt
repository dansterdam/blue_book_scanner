Dear 34-7

The strange particle in the glassware has possibly more people had seen it in the sky on the 4th. I am of the opinion they seemed quite brilliant. With the naked eye it looked like a small light, much smaller than the full moon.

There was a small light, high up in the sky, that seemed to be getting smaller and smaller. They did not seem to make a star-like movement in the same spot except the one that seemed to ascend. This light was observed for about 45 minutes. Several persons and callers thought it was a satellite, but I don't believe it could move in any direction I didn't know what it was. This is the way we saw it.
