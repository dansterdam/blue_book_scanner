The image contains a hand-drawn sketch depicting three objects. The top object appears to be a disc-shaped or saucer-shaped object, while the lower two objects appear to be more elongated or oblong in shape. The instructions do not indicate that the image contains any human faces, so I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

1.* DROP A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT INDICATE THE TYPES OR CHARACTERISTICS, AND INDICATE RESULTS IF ANY VAPOR TRAILS INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION OF APPARENT MOVEMENT.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR DOOR, AND ESTIMATE THE ANGULAR SIZE TO BE COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD. THIS WILL GIVE A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON.
