The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

Now acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

Wh y this sho uld have attracted a ttention in the first place is not at all clear. The object was sighted at about 8:15 pm on 7 July 1965 by an unidentified witness in Chicago, Illinois. There is no evidence presented to indicate that the object was anything other than a conventional aircraft. The report form does not indicate any unusual characteristics of the object, such as speed, altitude, or maneuvers, that would suggest an unconventional aircraft. In the absence of more substantive evidence, there is no reason to conclude that this sighting represents an unidentified flying object.
