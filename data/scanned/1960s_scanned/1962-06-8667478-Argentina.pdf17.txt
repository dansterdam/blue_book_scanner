MAY 31 - A strange globe-shaped machine speeding over England at 8,000 ft. Capt. Gordon Pendleton, former Royal Air Force pilot, stated he sighted the UFO's tracked under his plane at a distance of about 6 miles. He said "it was quite clear," he stated. "It was oval-shaped, with a bright white light in the center and a pulsating bluish-green hue about its periphery. It gave off no exhaust or vapor trail, and paced his plane for about 20 minutes at an indicated airspeed of about 600 mph."

Pendleton called the Cotswold Airport control tower but the object disappeared from both sight and radar. The tower confirmed the sighting. Pendleton's description to Flt Lt Murphey confirmed the captain's account.

Air Ministry are investigating.
