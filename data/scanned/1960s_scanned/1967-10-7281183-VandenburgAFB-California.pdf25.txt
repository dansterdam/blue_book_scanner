Vandenberg Sighting Report

2100-0200 - (Times uncertain because of the confusion, although this could, very laboriously, be checked by examining the computer printouts from the radars and by listening to the tape of Ralston's conversations with the radar operators and with the other military bases, these materials being available at VAFB but not in the Colorado Project files).

Radar observations:

a. Up to 14 targets were seen. 
b. Velocities ranged from 0 to 80 knots, with rapid changes in altitudes.
c. The radars would lose their locks and then reengage.
d. NORAD surveillance radar on the base did not see anything, but the operator did talk about having a "good deal of clutter or perhaps jamming." (The surveillance radar operates at a frequency quite different from the tracking radars.)
e. Point Mugu reported a target "bigger than any flat-top at three miles."
f. As the radar activity increased, the number of visual observations decreased. The radars attracted all the attention.
g. The target that went directly overhead is the one that produced an 80 db signal. Three persons went outside the radar shack but were unable to see it.
h. One of the strongest target of all really "moved out in azimuth." A total of eight objects appeared on the radar to emerge from this one. After the separation, the original target continued on.
