Text from the document:

it suddenly disappeared, and its speed in maneuver was such that it was estimated to travel at a speed of 900 mph. This object was silently observed moving in a general southerly direction, and they could not hear any sound emitted from it. The duration of this sighting was approximately 2 minutes.

These witness reports confirm that what they saw was a real, unfamiliar object, and not a familiar aircraft. The witnesses were reliable and experienced observers, and they have no rational explanation for what they observed. I commend their careful observations and explanations of what they saw.
