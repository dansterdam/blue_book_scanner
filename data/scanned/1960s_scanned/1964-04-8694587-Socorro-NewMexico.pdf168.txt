Flying Saucer Reports Spread
In New Mexico

New Mexico's perennial addiction to flying saucers has taken hold of the state again with more "objects" reported to have been spotted over various parts of the state.

The latest, which brought out the Air Force and the FBI, was spotted early Sunday morning at La Madera, about 50 miles north of Santa Fe. State Police Captain Ray Shriver said they definitely saw "something there."

Orlando Gallegos of Santa Fe said he and State Police Officer Alfred Crollett within 200 feet of a huge metallic object that looked like an "airplane without wings" and flames spurted silently from numerous jets around the bottom of the object. The object was about 14 feet in circumference, he told police.

A similar report came the same night from a Socorro policeman who said he spotted an object near Socorro Airport. The officer reports the object rose slowly from the ground and then shot away at a tremendous speed "about 20 feet off the ground." The Socorro reports came in about 10 minutes before the La Madera sightings.

In both the Socorro and the La Madera reports, the object was reported to have landed. Additional reports said the objects were about 20 to 30 feet in diameter and left "paw prints, like a mountain lion's" as well as "indentations" in the dirt.

Until the weekend spotting, the most recent UFO sighting in New Mexico came from several motorists including a Las Vegas campus policeman at the University of New Mexico who said they saw a "silvery looking" object. It disappeared over a mountain in the western sky at the same time.
