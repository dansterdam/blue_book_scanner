The object was encountered at 9:30 pm. Directly overhead. It was walking across my lawn to my house with Bob Ellison. It noticed us and hollered "Bob it's cold". The object was moving out past (illegible) 50 mph. Emission of light was noted to to assumption that it was an atmospheric condition at the time. It was haird light after Bob it'll mail the report. We were shook up, and it was hard for Bob to fill up the national report. He was willing.
