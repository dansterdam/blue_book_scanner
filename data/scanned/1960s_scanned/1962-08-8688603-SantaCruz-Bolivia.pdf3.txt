The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Illumination of my immediate surroundings resulting from the object. As I did not have on my person any light producing device (such as a flashlight, etc.), I cannot describe its original appearance. As I first saw it, the object appeared to be a clear sky, with a small amount of smoke and haze. Wind was from the northwest. The object was in my view for about two seconds before that. Its disappearance occurred in an almost instantaneous manner in brilliance and sharpness. The object appeared to be a clear sky with a small amount of smoke and haze.
