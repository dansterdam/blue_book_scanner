"This remark is made in passing, but perhaps you too have wondered about the fact that many of the "flying saucer" reports carrying on a manner that they are today (at least I like to think that sighting of unidentified objects in the past wasn't as continuous as the good people of flying saucers would have us believe). You are in a better position to see what is going on than we are.

Recently I saw a vague remark in a discussion going on in January, concerning the fact that a certain individual has mounted a concerted and comprehensive attack on the "flying saucer" theory and the USAF's stand that "there isn't anything to it". The individual (should) his name is being withheld, and the report indicated his attack was quite devastating, to the point of eliminating the better cases. This, of course, means will have to be included in any publication of the USAF or Project Blue Book report, since they want to be completely honest. We are working over against and hope to better than July for a batting average, details on those cases which didn't make it until 15 February). When you in a position to give us the dope, we will be most appreciative. We are waiting over eager and hope to better than July for a batting average, since details are the fact what (didn't make it until 15 February).  When you in a position to give us the dope, we will be most appreciative.
