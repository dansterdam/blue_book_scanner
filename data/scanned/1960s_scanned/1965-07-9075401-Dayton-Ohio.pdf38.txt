The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

On 14 Jul 65 Mr Al Morris called from NEAR he had Mr Vince Lalloy in his office. Lalloy had a news clipping of the Azores, he thinks it was one of his balloons on its second go around. On 23 Jun 65 they launched a couple of unusual super pressures balloons, to check out how stable they are, one was a conventional balloon 10,000 feet, tracked for a few days, another balloon was at around 6500 ft, two balloons tied together, 20 ft long 18 inches in diameter, they were just strapped together, looked like one long cylinder, with payload, if it would have survived it would be at an altitude of 6000 ft.

In order to clarify, would have to find an observer who would say it was long, size of the balloon is not important, the payload should be vertical, can we check this for NEAR. Talky will be flying from New Zealand on a 4project starting in September for 127 nations. He mentioned that the Air Force Cambridge Research Lab is flying things but won't tell.

Should talk to a Tom Kelley 27-6100, ext 3013.

We talked to Cambridge Massachusetts again and they said no they didn't have any classified balloon projects at present and all balloons were accounted for.
