Dear [Redacted],

Project Blue Book Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has evaluated the UFO sighting you recently reported.

The observation contained in your report is possibly explainable. The sighting was of a high altitude aircraft contrail, which had just set off while the sun was low on the horizon, producing a temporary effect of brilliance that may have suggested a UFO.

Also, it is not likely that a balloon or similar aircraft could have produced the observed maneuvers and attitudes to the extent that was described. The object was visible for only about 15 minutes. This represents about the normal time that condensation trails from high altitude aircraft remain visible.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
MAJOR, USAF
