The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text discussing an encounter with an unidentified flying object.

Text from the document:

I have this object, I was about 300 yards from it. It was disc-shaped, about 50 ft diameter, hovering about 50 ft off the ground. It was very pale in color, reflecting the moonlight. I have this object on film, but the film is of poor quality and will not show much detail. There was no sound at all from the object. It hovered for about 2 to 3 minutes and then suddenly it began to accelerate at an incredible rate of speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. I cannot estimate the exact speed, but it was extremely fast. I am a photographer by profession and I am quite familiar with aircraft of all kinds. This was definitely not any known aircraft. It was a metallic disc-shaped object, solid in appearance, with no visible openings or parts. Whatever this object was, it was certainly real and I am convinced that it was some type of advanced flying machine, far beyond present-day aircraft capabilities. I hope the film I took will show at least some detail, but as I said, the quality is very poor. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
