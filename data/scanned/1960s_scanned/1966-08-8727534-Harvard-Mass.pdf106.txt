Sat. 8/6/66
Mr. Richard Henry 
Rt. 2, Box 171 
Harvard, Mass.

Sighting report of UFO on Aug. 5, 1966. At approx 9:30 p.m., I was outside on my lawn looking up at the sky when I noticed a bright object hovering in the western sky. It was about 30 degrees off the horizon and appeared to be a steady white light. The object gradually moved to the northeast and disappeared over the horizon. The object appeared to be much larger than a star and was brighter than the surrounding stars. The object moved in a straight line and the flight was very steady. I observed the object for about 2-3 minutes before it disappeared. I have seen many unusual objects in the sky over the years but this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.

Sincerely, 
Richard Henry
