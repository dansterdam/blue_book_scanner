March 28, 1969

Dear Sir:

Ordinarily, if I am a person who doesn't like solving UFO cases and has informed others in the parapsychology field that I am a debunker - a person who does not believe in UFOs and has a closed mind - I probably would not be writing to you. However, I have had a strange experience, and I feel a need to relate it to someone who specializes in UFO research and may be able to offer some helpful information.

On the night of March 2, 1969, at approximately 8:00 p.m., I was looking out my kitchen window and was attracted by a bright light in the southern sky. At first I thought it was an airplane, but it was moving too slowly and steadily to be an aircraft. I observed it for several minutes, and it appeared to be a disc-shaped object, giving off a brilliant white light.

After a while, the light began to dim, and the object started to move upward at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight. I am a fairly rational person, and I must admit that I was quite shaken by what I saw. I have no explanation for it, and I would appreciate any information you could provide about the case.

As a result of this sighting, I find myself with a changed attitude toward UFO research. I am now more open-minded and willing to look into the subject objectively. Please let me know if you would like me to provide any additional details about my experience.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted]
