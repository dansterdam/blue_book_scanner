The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten observation report describing the sighting of a bright orange-yellow object moving slowly across the sky. The report includes a timeline of the object's movement and a series of sketches depicting the object's changing appearance over time.

Observation of object - Sept.7, 1968

I looked out the window and saw a bright orange-yellow objectificating slowly across the sky. After about a minute of its moving across, it stood still for about 15 seconds. Then it started moving slowly again. After about another 15 seconds. After that it started to fall apart, parts falling off and burning out until it was all over.
