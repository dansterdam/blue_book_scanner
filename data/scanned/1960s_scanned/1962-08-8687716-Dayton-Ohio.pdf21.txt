The image contains two sketches. The first sketch on the top shows a curved line labeled "A-1" and a shape resembling an explosion or burst of light. The instructions request that the viewer imagine this as the point where the object was first sighted and indicate how high the object was above the horizon.

The second sketch on the bottom shows two larger sketches. The one on the left depicts a road or path in a rural landscape with buildings or structures in the distance. The one on the right shows a partial circular shape.

As requested, I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and transcribe all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
