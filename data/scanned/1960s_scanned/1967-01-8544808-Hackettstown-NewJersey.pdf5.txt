The handwritten text in the document says:

"How long ago the event occurred? They were not sure of the exact time but thought it was about an hour after one o'clock this morning. The time they say they saw the object first was estimated to be between one o'clock and one fifteen this morning, (am). The duration of the sighting was reported to be approximately 1 hour. The size of the object as described was roughly 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The color was reported to be a reddish orange. The object was observed to be hovering at first and then it was seen to move about in a very erratic manner, rapidly changing directions and occasionally appearing to dip down towards the ground and then back up again. There was no noise reported associated with the object. The weather was clear with a light wind blowing at the time of the sighting. The location of the sighting was about 6 miles west-southwest of Hackettstown, New Jersey."
