MARTIN didn't Cary not when or did he but also it was seen. SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED HERE. THE THING, the mechanics of this, 5 or 6 feet in diameter, EXPLODED into the 1LUE SKY. There explosion was great, but possibly the size of one of those fat jet liners you see today. This thing may have had some type of force field around it that held it together, ONCE THE FORCE FIELD WAS BROKEN APART, IT EXPLODED. IT SEEMS THERE WAS MUCH MORE GROUND COVERAGE THAN ONE USUALLY HEARS ABOUT. MARTIN was plowing, and saw the thing suddenly explode. He was about 220 million miles from the Earth when this happened and was afraid to get any closer, don't ask me why, but he did not report it until HE WAS 150 FEET AWAY. His story checks out in every respect. The EARTH IS NOW a very difficult PLACE TO LIVE.
