The image does not contain any photographs. It consists of two sketches.

The first sketch shows a curved shape above the horizon line, with instructions to mark "A" on the curve and "B" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon when the observer last saw it.

The second sketch shows a road with trees and buildings on the sides, with a person standing in the middle of the road. This is described as a larger sketch to be used as an example of how to complete the first sketch.

Transcribed text from the document:

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete this.
