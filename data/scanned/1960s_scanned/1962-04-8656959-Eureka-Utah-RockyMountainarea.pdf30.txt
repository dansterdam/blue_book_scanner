Many times I have seen, and again tonight, objects in the sky on night again seems real. Not as unreal as some think. Sometimes I can't find the words to describe exactly what I saw. Have seen 3 different type of objects on June 9, 1962 at approximately 11:00 p.m. in the Northern Rocky Mountain area near Eureka, Utah. I have observed these objects on many occasions and believe them to be some types of unidentified flying objects.
