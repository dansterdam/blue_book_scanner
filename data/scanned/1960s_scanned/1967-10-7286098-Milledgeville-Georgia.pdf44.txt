The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed text description of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting incident.

Talked to the Univ of Colo. about the sighting. The boy was sitting on his ground when both pictures were taken. The boy then moved to his right and took the second shot. The boy could give no reason for sitting down to photograph the object.
