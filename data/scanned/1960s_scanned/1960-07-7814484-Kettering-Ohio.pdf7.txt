The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with questions and spaces for handwritten answers.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
The image contains a hand-drawn diagram showing a straight horizontal line with an "A" at the beginning and a "B" at the end, indicating the motion of the object.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
The handwritten answer indicates the object was about 1/3 the size of the match stick used as a reference.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or known length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The handwritten answer mentions that about 1/3 of the object would have been covered by the match head.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The handwritten answer states "It did not disappear".

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
The handwritten answer describes the object as "a ball of light from 10 to 20 feet in diameter, white in color and traveling at a high rate of speed".
