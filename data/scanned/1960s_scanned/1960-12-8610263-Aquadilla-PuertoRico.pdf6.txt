The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing a UFO sighting.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Appearing very close in the space and a little bit behind a small, elongated object (but it was not a balloon) which moved very fast at a constant speed. I watched it closely and it appeared to me as a rather large, oval-shaped object, white in color, emitting a pale bluish-green glow, no wings or tail fins, and having no visible means of propulsion. It moved with a slight wobbling motion, ascending very smoothly and disappearing into the sky.

In case you could find a bit of time to make an investigation in this matter, I would like to hear from you as soon as possible and let me know the result of your findings.

Yours truly,
