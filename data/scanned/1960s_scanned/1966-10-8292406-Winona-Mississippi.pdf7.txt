27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the compass where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.
