AT 1457 z, 11 April 61 an unidentified flying object was sighted on radar in the vicinity of Cape Canaveral. Three experienced observers watched the target on an FPS-16 radar for 30 minutes and estimated its speed as ranging between 1500 and 6000.  These observers reported that the object orbited 6 or 7 times along an azimuth of 126 degrees from Cape Canaveral and distance of 50 to 85 miles. The radar observers' estimates of the height of the UFO did not agree, some reporting the object as very low and others that it was extremely high. A range surveillance G-2 was vectored to within 2-1/2 miles of the object but reports from the aircraft were negative. No other intercept action was accomplished because GCI FPS-20 radar picked up the UFO only intermittently.
