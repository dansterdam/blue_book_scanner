No Case (Information Only)

Previously 12 May 1962 report of four similar looking objects in the sky between 4:20-4:55 PM near a transport plane leaving Hanscom Air Force Base. In all three of these July 1962 sightings, no recognizable circular or disc-shaped objects were seen under good weather conditions and good clear edge outlines - no haziness or lights. In this report, Hanscom Field authorities there stated that there were unconfirmed reports of a previous sighting in that same area of UFOS over or near Hanscom in recent weeks. The Director of Personnel and Training, who is highly doubtful, did not report his sightings to the Air Force until the 12 May incident occurred.
May 13--Boston Patent Lawyer Robert K. Biddell reported four saucer-shaped objects maneuvering near a transport plane leaving Hanscom Field near Lexington, Mass.
