Policeman Recalls Night Which Changed His Life
By JAKE BOCHER
Socorro, N.M. - (UPI) - Police Patrolman Lonnie Zamora says now he can hardly believe what happened to him one night two weeks ago in the isolated desert southwest of here.
It was about 5:45 p.m. on a Wednesday afternoon-evening shift and Zamora was investigating what sounded like a dynamite explosion in the hills about five miles from this city.
What he found kept him on the scene for nearly two hours. He says it was something he can't explain, and the encounter has changed his outlook on life.
"I was more frightened than I've ever been in my life," said the 55-year-old officer, who has been on the force 17 years.
The 31-year-old father of five said he has convinced about 1,000 state and federal officers - including the FBI, Air Force UFO investigator, Allen Hynek of Northwestern University, and state police - that he saw something strange that evening. He said he radioed for assistance and stayed on the scene until other officers arrived.
"I don't know what it was," Zamora said. "I just know I saw it."
The officer said the experience has had an impact on him. He now tries to keep more to himself and wonders what more would be revealed if other policemen would come forward about similar experiences.
Zamora said he and his wife are trying to get back to normal. They were today going to have dinner in their patrol car for the first time since the incident.
"I don't know what it was and I'm still trying to figure it out," he said.
