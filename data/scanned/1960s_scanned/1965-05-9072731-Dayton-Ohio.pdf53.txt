[Redacted] called and gave me the information described in this form. As he said it looked like a light on an airplane but had no wing lights, or better yet it looked like a satellite. Then he asked if we had any satellites in the area tonight because that is what it looked like. I got all of the information from him that I thought was required to complete the form. The weather information was obtained from the Patterson weather station at 21h55. He did not ever call the light an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO). He seemed more interested in finding out if we had any satellites out in the area tonight.
