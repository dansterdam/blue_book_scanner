The image contains a detailed diagram and sketch related to a UFO sighting, but does not appear to contain any actual photographs. The diagram shows various angles and directions, and the text describes instructions for imagining and drawing the motion of the observed object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object appeared above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was observed (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

And here is my attempt at OCR:

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
