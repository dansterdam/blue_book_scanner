Dear sir,
I was coming home from a church meeting at approximately 10:30 pm on the night of January 9, 1966. It was a very clear night. As I was driving east on the Woodman Rd. I cam to the end of the street and was about to turn south on Richmond Rd. I have appeared in the sky directly in front of me a large brilliant object. It seem to be hovering or stationary about 100 to 150 feet off the ground and about 50 to 75 yards in front of me. Although it was no longer visible when I turned south, I continued to observe it in my rear view mirror for several minutes until it disappeared from view.
