SCIENTIST REFUTES AIR FORCE CLAIM THAT UFOs ARE "STARS": Unidentified objects which were picked up on radar on August 2nd at the Wichita, Kansas, weather bureau, as well as elsewhere throughout the Midwest, and west, were said by the Air Force to be the planet Jupiter or assorted stars. Robert Risser, Director of the Oklahoma Science and Art Foundation Planetarium in Oklahoma City (where numerous sightings were also made), said that local residents certainly did not see Jupiter or any of the stars which the Air Force listed in their explanatory report. Said Risser: "This (statement by the Air Force) is as far from the truth as you can get. Somebody has made a mistake. These stars and planets are on the opposite side of the earth from Oklahoma City at this time of year." 

The sightings in question came in during the early days of August from Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming. In addition to numerous radar sightings, there were dozens of reports by private citizens as well as police. But the Air Force stated, after a very superficial investigation, that the sightings were probably of the planet Jupiter or the stars Rigel, Canella, Betelgeuse, or Aldeberan.
