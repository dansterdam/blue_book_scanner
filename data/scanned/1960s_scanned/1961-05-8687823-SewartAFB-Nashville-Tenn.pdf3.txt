Transcribing the text:

Dear Sir,

Thank you for your letter of June 25th.

You shall attempt to be more explicit regarding the sighting you reported to the Air Force Technical Observer on this same date.

Your letter does not contain a description of an aerial phenomenon which you observed, and which would be classified as an Unidentified Flying Object. It appears that you are merely describing the operation of a series of weather balloons that were released from the field at Sewart AFB on June 23rd.

The release of these balloons is a normal routine operation in the Department of Defense, and is not considered a matter of intelligence interest. From two to twelve balloons of various configurations are launched daily from this and other Air Force installations. The diameter of even the smaller balloons is so high it exceeds five feet, and the balloons are generally high altitude devices intended for upper atmosphere research and instrumentation. They are classified as unmanned, non-operational balloons and serve a variety of scientific purposes. Their release is in no way connected with any unusual or unidentified aerial activity.

Since your letter does not describe any aerial phenomenon which could be considered an Unidentified Flying Object, I am unable to take any further action. If you have observed something in the sky which you believe to be of intelligence interest, I would appreciate a more detailed account, including the date, time, location, direction of travel, size, color, shape, and duration of the sighting. Only then could this office properly evaluate the matter.

I trust this explanation clarifies the situation. Please feel free to write again if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
