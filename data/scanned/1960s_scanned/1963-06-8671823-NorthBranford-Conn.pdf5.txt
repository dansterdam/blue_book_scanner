The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, but it does not contain any photographs. The text on the page appears to be handwritten responses to a questionnaire.

The transcribed text from the document is as follows:

"The object was without fear. Moved back and forth about the same way sea jelly brush and then was gone up with no sound of air. So say that people did not hear anything of the deal."
