Portugal Reports UFO Sightings
Sightings of strange objects through the country continue to baffle the Portuguese weather bureau and the military-observer corps. Descriptions of the objects, which remained stationary and seemed to defy gravit were similar to those reported earlier this month in the Antarctic, where six mysterious flying objects appeared in the northern skies of the U.S. Antarctic station and were seen by the weather bureau-classed interference from one among our electronic equipment such as meteorological rockets. Descriptions of the objects were strikingly similar to official Air Force reports of sightings in Antarctica.
