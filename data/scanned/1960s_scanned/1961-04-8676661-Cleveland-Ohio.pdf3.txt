(PLEASE QUESTION 7) LOOKING OUT WINDOW WEST AROUND 9:30PM, OHIOAN AIRCRAFT AND A BRIGHT LIGHT APPEARED STATIONARY AROUND IT CLOSER TO ME THAN THE AIRCRAFT THAT I CAN SEE PRETTY CLEARLY. THIS BRIGHT LIGHT SUDDENLY STARTED TO MOVE UPWARD AND AWAY FROM THE AIRCRAFT AT TREMENDOUS SPEED. IT MOVED AT LEAST FIVE MILES ACROSS THE SKY IN ABOUT 2 SECONDS. IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A STAR OR A VERY BRIGHT STAR. IT WAS MUCH LARGER THAN ANY STAR I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE . THIS LIGHT APPEARED TO BE SELF LUMINOUS, MEANING THAT IT WAS NOT REFLECTING LIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT OR ANY OTHER SOURCE. THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED ON ITS REGULAR FLIGHT PATH, WHILE THE LIGHT DISAPPEARED IN THE DISTANCE. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.
