AS TO THE EXACT CAUSE. IN OVER 20,000 REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTs NO ONE HAS BEEN HARMED BY THE OBJECT ITSELF. IT APPEARS THAT SOME REPORTS OF OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN FABRICATED OR EXAGGERATED EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY. REPORTS OF ENCOUNTERS UNDER UNUSUAL CONDITIONS OR CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT JUSTIFY ANY ALARM.
