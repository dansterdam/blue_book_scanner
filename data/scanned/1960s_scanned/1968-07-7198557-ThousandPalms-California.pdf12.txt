Dear Mr.--

This is a reply to your letter postmarked August 3, 1966, in which you state that you have seen another unidentified flying object (UFO) and would like to report it to the Air Force.

We are enclosing another questionnaire and an envelope so you may complete it and return it to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Also enclosed is a list of Air Force bases in the United States and their addresses. In the future, please send any UFO reports directly to the Office of Information Services, so that they can be brought to the attention of the investigating officers at the nearest Air Force base.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. ATKINS
