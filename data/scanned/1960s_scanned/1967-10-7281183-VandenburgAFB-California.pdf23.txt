Details of the Sightings
2000 to 2045 - Atherton observed visually from his house near Lompoc, for one half hour, an object at azimuth 290째. He called also at home, three miles to the south, who confirmed the sighting at an azimuth of approximately 290째.
At an altitude of 10 to 15째, Atherton observed the object through 7-50 binoculars and reported it looked to be the size of a large thumbtack, elliptical in shape - a red and green light separated by a small distance, like the wing span of an aircraft. But there was no motion. It was fuzzy, like a top spinning.
2045 Ralston called Ralston at Range Control Operations (located at an altitude of 900 to 1,100 ft.). Ralston confirmed the visual observation said it appeared to have white, red, and green or blue colors that did not vary. They "looked like the running lights on a stationary object." Bearing 290째, cut several miles, at approximately 19,000 ft. altitude. It was suggested that the object looked like a helicopter.
