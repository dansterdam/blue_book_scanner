UFO
N.A.S.A. Washington, D.C.

Dear sir:

On January 13, 1964, at approximately 4:55 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, a light was observed over the Gainesville, Florida area. The light was silvery in color and appeared to be somewhat rounded in shape. It was estimated to be about 400 feet in diameter and was descending and moving in an easterly direction. The light remained visible for approximately 15 to 20 seconds before it disappeared. It made no sound and left no trail. The light was observed by a number of people in the area, including several university professors and staff members. Their observations were consistent with the details provided above.

We would appreciate your assistance in determining the nature of this observation. If any further information is required, please let me know.

Sincerely,
