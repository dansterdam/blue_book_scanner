There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

THE ENCLOSED ARTICLE IS ALL I HAVE FROM THE LOCAL PAPERS ABOUT THE OBJECT IN VIRGINIA. TWO SOAS OCCURRED TO ME AS A RESULT. SINCE YOU HAVE NOTED THAT ALL MY SIGHTINGS WERE MADE OUT LAST OF HUNTINGTON, MY WAS IN A GENERAL LINE LAST THRU CHARLESTON, WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS AND INTO VIRGINIA TERRITORY WHERE YOU NOW HAVING A SLIGHT SECLAM. THE VIRGINIA SIGHTINGS ARE COMING ABOUT A YEAR AFTER MY SECOND SIGHTINGS AND MY SECOND PAIR THIS PLACE ABOUT A YEAR AFTER MY FIRST SIGHTINGS. 

IT STRIKES ME THAT A NEW FACTOR HAS ENTERED THE PICTURE. YOU RECALL FROM THE KEVENS WRITING THAT HE MENTIONS TWO MAJOR PERIOD OF SAUCER ACTIVITIES: WORLD WAR II AND THE ATOM BOMB PERIOD INCLUDING THE POST-WAR EXPERIMENTS. 

THE FACTOR INFLUENCING THE SAUCER VISITS WAS--- WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE--- NOW IT SEEMS WE HAVE A DIFFERENT ENTERED THIS PICTURE. THAT IS THE DECISIONS OF THE SAUCER PEOPLE THEMSELVES. I HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THEY MAY HAVE AN IMPROVED SAUCER AND ARE ABLE TO PINPOINT OBSERVATIONS--- IN THIS CASE, VA. & W. VA. TERRITORY. THE PROXIMITY AND POSITION OF THE SAUCER HOME BASE, SPEED AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS, MAY ALLOW SCHEDULED OBSERVATIONS IN ONE YEAR CYCLES INSTEAD OF RANDOM OBSERVATIONS AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS.

P.S.---
ARE OUR SATELLITES CARRYING ANYTHING LIKE THE TELE-PHOTO EQUIPMENT TO MAKE AND TRANSMIT PICTURES OF ANY ONE EXAMINING THEM WHILE THEY ARE OPERATIONAL IN SPACE?
