Dear sir:

Thank you for your letter concerning your possible observation of the sighting of Sputnik IV. We have forwarded your letter to Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official project for the investigation of unidentified flying objects in the United States.

Information concerning Soviet satellite activities is not appropriate, as the Air Force's knowledge of activities in space is appreciable.

Sincerely,

DANIEL W. MCCLAND
Colonel, USAF
