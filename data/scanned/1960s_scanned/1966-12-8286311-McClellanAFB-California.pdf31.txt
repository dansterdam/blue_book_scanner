High-flying "Phenomenon" Sighted Near Equator by CPA Pilot, Crew
MEXICO CITY - Unidentified flying objects were sighted over the Pacific Ocean by the Canadian Pacific Airlines crew, it was reported by Canadian Pacific Airlines officials here. The incident occurred while the 'plane was flying from Lima, Peru, to Mexico, when the pilot, Capt. Bill Vogt, and his crew, including Navigator Mike Mois, trainee, sighted two lights in the sky.
In the words of Captain Vogt: It was about midnight when I spotted two lights off in the distance. They seemed to be miles apart and moving towards each other. I called the co-pilot, Wolfgang Pepper, and we both watched them come closer. At one point they seemed to shoot straight up and then came back down, again spreading apart and moving together, this went on for a couple of minutes and then they disappeared.
There was no sound and no exhaust from these objects which were estimated to be traveling at several thousand miles an hour, far beyond any known aircraft speeds. The crew was quite disturbed by the experience, but added that the objects might have been some kind of atmospheric phenomenon, beyond the scope of their flying career.
