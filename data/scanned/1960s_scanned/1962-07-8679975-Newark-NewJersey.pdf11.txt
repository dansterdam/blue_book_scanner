Text from the document:

It is suggested that this was an aircraft of some kind. It was daylight, clear weather, and the object was revolving around a point in the sky in a circular motion. There were no "circular base" or other usual features associated with the classic type of flying saucer. The windows were all about the same size and were all around the circular object. There were colored lights inside which were visible through the windows. The witness stated the area surrounding the windows was opaque and the interior could not be seen clearly. The witness could not estimate the size of the object. The rings put put was obscure, the red light and blue light designated by the witness we so arranged that they gave the appearance of stability or aids of some kind to the motion. This was the most stable and regular motion I have ever seen reported by a witness. But this case is quite similar to a number of other cases I have become acquainted with in the past. There is no proof offered, no photographs, sketches, or other physical evidence to confirm the details of the report. This case is one of those of another indication of the reality of the aerial phenomenon, but the details remain obscure and difficult to pin down with any great precision. This should be considered seriously with an open mind as to the possibilities it may suggest.

As I am convinced that this was an aircraft of some kind. It is difficult to arrive at any firm conclusions. I would appreciate any comments or suggestions you may have regarding this case.

I hope this information is of help to you. I would appreciate any comments or suggestions you may have.

Sincerely,
