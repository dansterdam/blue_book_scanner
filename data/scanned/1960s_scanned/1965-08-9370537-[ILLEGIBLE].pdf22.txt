There is no photograph present in the image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is an old UFO report.

The text found in the document is as follows:

Dear Mr

Personnel at the project office which handles reports, photographs, and miscellaneous data on unidentified flying objects have viewed material submitted to close formations.

There is no reason to believe that the objects indicated cannot be attributed to close formations.

We appreciate your interest in forwarding these photographs to us.

Sincerely,

Chief, Project Blue Book
