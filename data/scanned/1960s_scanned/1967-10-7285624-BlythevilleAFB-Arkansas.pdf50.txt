TRANSCRIBED TEXT:

There were two bright - one slightly smaller of the other. My first thoughts were that they might have been airplanes -lights on the wings, lights on the tail. However, their behavior as they closed on us I could see the change.

They appeared to be circular craft travelling at a tremendous speed. They appeared to be under intelligent control. They seemed to close on our aircraft. We made an abrupt turn - the three headed straight for us and then under full power they shot away at an unbelievable speed. We were left startled and troubled as to what they were. We could not give chase as their acceleration was beyond our capability.

We discussed this phenomenon carefully amongst ourselves and felt we had encountered something quite out of the ordinary. More questions than answers came to our minds.
