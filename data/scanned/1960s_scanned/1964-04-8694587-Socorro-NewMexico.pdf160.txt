Girl Says She Was Burned While Watching UFO Land

Patrolman Lonnie Zamora said he was pursuing a hot rod when he sew two objects in the sky that appeared to be landing. He stopped his car and observed two small beings near a strange looking craft.

The craft took off and disappeared as Zamora approached. The next day he noticed scorched earth and broken shrubs at the site. He notified the FBI and the craft was later listed in Project Blue Book files.

Another witness, Sharon Stull, said she was burned and felt ill effects from watching the UFO land. Her doctor said the burns indicate exposure to some type of energy or heat.

The article states that one official said it would be the first verified landing of a UFO and they wanted to get to the site as soon as possible to investigate. However, the article mentions that they were unable to find any balloons or other equipment at the site, leaving them with no knowledge of what Sharon Stull saw at the time.
