There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows the contents of an old UFO report document, specifically page 8, which appears to contain handwritten notes and text.

OD'S note:
Because Mr. Carolla was no longer at the scene, I did not question him extensively (he was calling from a distance non-collect from totals), but asked him to write down his recollections on paper so that he would be able to recall the observations clearly in case of further need of information from him. 

He said he also heard something on a 3 Months(?) (Canada) radio about a sighting, the same date almost exactly similar to what he saw.

I wonder in a case on the Detroit or proximity will of companions at 011s when the occupants observed lights in the sky as described in above this papp.
