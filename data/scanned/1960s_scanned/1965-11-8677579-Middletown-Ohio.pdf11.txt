There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a page from an old project Blue Book UFO report document. The image shows a typed letter from the Armco Steel Corporation in Middletown, Ohio, dated November 26, 1965, addressed to Major Hector Quintanilla, U.S.A.F., Chief Project Blue Book, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

The text of the letter is as follows:

ARMCO STEEL CORPORATION
GENERAL OFFICES - MIDDLETOWN, OHIO 45043

WALTER C. FAGUE
MANAGER AIR TRANSPORTATION

November 26, 1965

Major Hector Quintanilla, USAF
Chief Project Blue Book
Wright-Patterson AFB
Ohio 45433

Dear Sir:

In reply to your letter of 15 November, 1965, with reference to your investigation of an unidentified flying object, I am submitting the following information:

The pilots aboard the Armco Steel Corporation aircraft 11-37-A were interviewed and the unidentified who are employees of the company.

a. There were no unusual lights or other aircraft observed during the approach to the airport.

b. The time of landing was 10:40 EST (23:40Z).

c. The approach path and the aircraft was from the northeast over the field after which a right turn was executed and the aircraft then proceeded westbound until entering a downwind leg on the southwesterly heading in preparation for landing.

d. There is no afterburner used on the engines.

Insofar as there are wing tip and tail flashing strobe lights installed on the aircraft which we operated at the time, as well as top and bottom running lights, nothing unusual helped in your determination.

We hope that the above will be of some assistance to you.

Very truly yours,
[Signature redacted]
Pilot
