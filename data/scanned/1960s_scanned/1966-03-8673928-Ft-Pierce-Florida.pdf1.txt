11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Two young observers were going to Scout's and while on their way through the woods when they noticed a bright object. They first thought it was a rocket but then scooped and figured it was a balloon painted with fluorescent paint. As they went on the object got brighter, it got so bright they couldn't look at it. They thought it was hovering, and found it on the ground. As soon as they got close enough to see what it was, it blew up.
