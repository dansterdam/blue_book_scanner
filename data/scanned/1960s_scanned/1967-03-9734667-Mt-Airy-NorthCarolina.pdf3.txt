The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

Mr. and I both observed with 7x50 binoculars, as well
The weather was clear, no clouds and no moon. The stars were brilliant, and the night was cold.  We can't think of anything else that may be of interest at this time other than the information that you can see in the report.
As I said before, this is all I can say about the incident. I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you need anything else.
Very truly yours,
