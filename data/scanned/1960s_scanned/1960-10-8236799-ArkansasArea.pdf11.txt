Dear Dr. Humphrey:

You may have been receiving further reports on some of the
events related to the Air Force case to which I have had a chance to
give official reply. This is to confirm that I have had to decline to
appear your request in the attention of others that there are no
such things as cosmic spacecraft.

Sincerely yours,
Donald H. Menzel
Director

Col. Major Gaevernman
Ldr Field
Don't you have anything in your files that relates to the reported
sightings?
