Further Speculation
We have made no chemical analysis of the markings and do not
intend to do so. In my previous letter I attempted to suggest the possibility
that the markings were placed upon the paper by stamping or printing rather than by an instrument such as a pencil,
which would tend to disrupt the fiber structure. Some of
my colleagues feel that this, the markings could have been made
with a special type of pencil used in photographic touchup
work and graphic arts processes. One example is
the MARS-Lumograph Dz, available thru J. S. Staedtler in this country.
Further speculation about the nature of the markings brought
out the comment that these markings appear to have been made
by a person with skilled hand and confidence in his ability.
Someone who was painstakingly and hesitatingly following a set pattern with
no previous experience. This again suggests the possibility
that a commercial artist, or someone with similar skills,
may have been involved in preparation of the coded message,
either for the incident under consideration or for some
previous occasion.
If there is any way in which we can be of further assistance to the Air Force
or to any agency investigating related aspects, please feel free to call
on us.
Very truly yours,
