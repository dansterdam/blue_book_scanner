PHOTOGRAPHY
P BN The 620 negative and print
QUALITY Fair
1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order 67-76 submitted by Major Quintanilla, (CIETRO)
2. ANSWERS: The submitted photography appears to be genuine as far as content is concerned;
however, the print is of a rather poor quality, having many scratches, finger
prints, and blemishes. The condition of the negative is also poor, having many scratches
and imperfections. Retouching over some of these imperfections was obviously attempted
prior to processing. The photography indicates some static electricity having occurred
prior to processing.
