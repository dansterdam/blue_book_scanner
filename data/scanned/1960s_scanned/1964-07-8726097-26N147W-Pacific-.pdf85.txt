Subject: Red Light Phenomenon Over Clearwater Beach
Fla.

Saturday Evening around 8:30 p.m. on July the Fourth 1964, while 
viewing the fireworks at Clearwater from the Belleair Beach Causeway, my wife 
and I saw a red light hovering approximately .5 mile out from shore. This light 
was approximately 100 yards in diameter.

There were five of them staggered in a north-south line and they would dim and 
brighten alternately as if taking turns. After watching for a short while I looked 
away for a moment to look at the fireworks and when I looked back they had 
vanished. I watched them for perhaps 3 minutes. I thought possibly a helicopter was 
dropping flares, but when they dimmed and brightened in unison, and then disappeared 
suddenly rather than dropping down, I realized this was no helicopter. The causeway
was crowded and there were approximately 200 people watching the display. Most of 
them also saw the lights and were discussing what they had seen.

I hope this information will aid you in your study and turn up by observation.

Thanks for your interest.

Clearwater, Fla.
