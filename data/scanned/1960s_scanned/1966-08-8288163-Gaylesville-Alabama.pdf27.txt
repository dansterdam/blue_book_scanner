Personal Comments:

1. After considering the facts as stated in the report as to the Air Force's have concluded that the unusual aerial phenomena that we observed were caused by natural atmospheric conditions combined with the electrical field near the ground and the magnetic field of the earth.

2. I believe that the "lights" were gases, electrically charged, which derived their energy from the natural electrical field and the magnetic field of the earth.

3. I think others, working in the field of U.F.O. or U.A.P. (unusual aerial phenomena) should be made aware of this observation - especially the "LINK" which occurred when the two subjects in the photograph came under the influence of the cause or causes that created the phenomenon.

4. NASA should not ignore the U.A.P. since it could possibly lead to new ideas for interplanetary probes for purposes of mapping the magnetic fields of other planets.
