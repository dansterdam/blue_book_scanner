Lake City, Pa. 2-28-67

Gentlemen:

I would like to report what I believe to be the sighting of a U.F.O. over this area. On the night of February 23, 1967 at approximately 7:45 P.M., while I was driving home from work, I observed what appeared to be a very bright luminous object in the sky to the northwest of Lake City, Pennsylvania. The object was hovering motionless for several minutes and then began to move in a circular pattern, at times disappearing and reappearing. The object was a round, disc-shaped craft which appeared to have a brightly lit dome or cupola on top and a flashing red light on the bottom. It remained in view for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes before speeding away at a tremendous rate of speed in a southerly direction. I have never seen anything like this before and I am quite puzzled by what I observed. I would appreciate any information you might be able to provide regarding this sighting. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,
