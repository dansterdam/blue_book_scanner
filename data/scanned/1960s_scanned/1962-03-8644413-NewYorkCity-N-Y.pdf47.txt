The image contains two drawings. The first drawing appears to be a partial circular shape, possibly representing a portion of a larger object. The second drawing is a simple sketch of a globe or planet.

The text accompanying the drawings states:

"Place an 'A' on the report where you found some of the object or 'B' where you could not see up."

"Place an 'A' on the report where the object workers were found some the object or 'B' where they could not see up."
