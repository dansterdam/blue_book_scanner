This page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a questionnaire or form with instructions and questions related to a UFO sighting.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion, or the object or objects seen. Place at the end of the path a "D", at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the sighting.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match or pencil at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this at the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw.
