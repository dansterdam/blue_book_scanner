UFO SIGHTING: 30 MARCH 1966

1. Reference the attached UFO report and negative which were forwarded to the Civil Defense and Disaster Control Organization, Freehold, New Jersey. The photograph represents the property of the Civil Defense and Disaster Control Organization and a copy is attached for your information.

2. Information necessary for a more detailed analysis would include focal length of the camera, exposure, and film data. Since this data is not available from local sources to determine the focal length. This revealed only typical photographs which were probably made for premium distributions. A camera of this type would normally make approximately three inch images. Assuming an approximate 36 inch focal length lens, the object subtends an angle of approximately 0.027 degrees and appears to have an estimated size of approximately three feet. Assuming an approximate three foot object is supported as indicated from camera data available from the observer is found on the back or one of his previous photographs. A range of approximately 1350 feet is used to calculate the subtend angle and subsequent size estimates of distance from camera to object (range) for each photograph.
