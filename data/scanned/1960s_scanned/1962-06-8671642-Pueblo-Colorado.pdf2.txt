Transcribed text from the document:

About 9:10 pm, MST, April 4, 1962, while watching the sky through backyard binoculars, I observed a bright light moving from west to east in the southern portion of the sky. The light was moving steadily at a fairly high altitude, gradually descending. After observing it for a short time, suddenly the light turned at a 90 degree angle and quickly accelerated, making a sharp turn and disappearing from sight. The observation lasted approximately 2 minutes.
