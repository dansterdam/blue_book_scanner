Evaluation of Source Reliability: Unreliable
Analysis and Conclusions: The prints was submitted to photo analysis. The information reported is too meager to allow a valid conclusion. The analyst states that the objects are either very small and close to the camera or large and distant. They appear to be quite dark compared to the other dark areas. It is possible that the negative or original print is underexposed. In one print, the objects size increased, indicating that they were closer to the camera than in the other print. However, the other objects in the print also increased in size, suggesting this was due to the objects being closer to the camera. The background appears to be overexposed, but the objects are just as dark as in the other print. These prints are probably the result of someone attempting to perpetrate a hoax.
