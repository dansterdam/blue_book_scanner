There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing various questions and instructions for the observer.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "M" at the beginning of the path, a "T" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length. How many times wider is the object than the match stick? If you had performed this test, please give us the results of this measurement as the angular size of the object.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that we can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the motion of the object or objects which, when added to the size, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
