The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch and a compass drawing. The sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline) and an object above it. The compass drawing shows the cardinal directions.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place on "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? --2--. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling. 

All were separate objects moving in the same pattern
