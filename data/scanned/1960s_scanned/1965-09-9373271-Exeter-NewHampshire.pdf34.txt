WIDESPREAD UFO REPORTS IN SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE

KENSINGTON, N.H. - An unusual report of a flying object observed overhead by several people, including police officers, in a field just outside this town, was received here.

A farmer, Norman Muscarello, informed the police that a strange, large, red object with flashing lights hovered over his barn for about 15 minutes toward midnight.

Muscarello was returning to his farm at about 2:30 a.m. when he saw the object. He said it was about 40-50 feet in diameter and brightly lighted. When he attempted to approach it, the object rose silently and quickly. 

He immediately notified the police, who responded. Three officers in a patrol car said they saw the object hovering over some trees and the barn. It then shot straight up and disappeared from sight.

Similar reports of other people having seen the object were received from this area. The descriptions were similar, describing a large, round, red-orange object with flashing lights.

On subsequent nights, other residents reported seeing strange objects in the sky, and the two nights later the police received another call about an unidentified flying object hovering over a nearby area. However, when they arrived the object had disappeared.

During the investigation it was learned that another resident, an airline pilot, had seen a similar object while driving in the area a week earlier.
