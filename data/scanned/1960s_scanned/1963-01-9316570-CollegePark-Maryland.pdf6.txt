The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document titled "JOINT MESSAGEFORM - CONTINUATION SHEET" classified as "UNCLASSIFIED" and dated January 9, 1963. The document provides a report from the 1001st AB WG, ANDREWS AFB, WASH 25, D.C. regarding a sighting of an observed object, where the Washington ATC Center contacted at 0509Z, had no knowledge of air traffic or unusual radar returns at the time and vicinity of the sighting. The document states that the assistant to the chief of operations and training, 1001st Operations Group, witnessed dozens of students observing the object, but the forecaster was skeptical about inversion causing the phenomenon, and no conclusion as to the cause or identity of the object was made.
