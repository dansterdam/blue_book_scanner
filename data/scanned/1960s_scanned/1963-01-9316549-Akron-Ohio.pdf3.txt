NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
9 JANUARY 1963
RAVENNA, OHIO

The text in the document reads as follows:

RAVENNA - ROUSTOWN - Jan. 9, 1963 - 6:10 PM. Mr. Rice and two other observers were witness to a strange event in local skies... Their attention was drawn to a very bright light source almost directly overhead. As they watched, the light source described it as round. After ten (10) minutes the object split into three (3) parts; all three parts proceeded southward and disappeared. The object was like that of an auto headlight. The object was either very low or tremendous in size if this in fact was an estimate made at Arama Heights. (From KLYN's UFO program)
