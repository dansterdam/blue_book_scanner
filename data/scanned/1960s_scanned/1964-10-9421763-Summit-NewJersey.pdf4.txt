There is no photograph contained in this image. It appears to be a typewritten letter from Major William Connor, Kirkland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, addressed to "Dear Major Connor".

The text of the letter is as follows:

I am requesting all available data, including detailed personal interviews, and photographs where possible, regarding sightings of an Unidentified Flying Object at Socorro, New Mexico. If you are not the officer heading the investigation, would you please forward me his name and address. 

I would also appreciate an official statement by the investigating agency as to their findings.

Trusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience,
Very truly yours,

P.S. If you are unable to give me any of the information, the letter on is anyone you feel may be of help. Thanks.
