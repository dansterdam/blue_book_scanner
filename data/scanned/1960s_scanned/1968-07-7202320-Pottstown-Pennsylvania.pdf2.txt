HEAD FOR RECORD:
At approximately 2330, he had a phone call from Major Wilson, SAFLL, Lt. Col. ORI/33, who stated that a reliable source had seen a UFO sighting the previous evening for over one of B&L officers, Congressman Schweiker, 13th District of Pennsylvania, related to their office.
(Called Wright-Patterson on it, but called Benton (AS), the nearest base to the Congressman's home district and nearest the sighting (Congressmart: Montgomery Co., Pa.). Benton had no report, but told Wright-Patterson (Area 517 -- K75-5912) could be glad to investigate if one of the 32 witnesses would be available to interview.)
At 1010, called Major Wilson, SAFLL, and gave him the above information.
He planned to relay it to the Congressman.
