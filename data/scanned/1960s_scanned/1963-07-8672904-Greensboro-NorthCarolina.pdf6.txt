The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram or sketch depicting a UFO sighting scenario. The diagram shows a curved horizon line with various angles and directions marked, as well as a compass rose. The text below the diagram provides instructions and questions related to the sighting, such as drawing the motion of the object, indicating the direction the object was moving, and describing any multiple objects that may have been observed.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved horizon line the highest point you first saw of the object. Place a "B" on this line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" again on the line when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, and show any change in direction during the course. DOTTED LINE = SLOW
HEAVY = RAPID ACCE

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
