The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text on what appears to be a page from a UFO report document. The text appears to be a detailed description of a UFO sighting, including the date, time, location, and some observations made by the witness.

I will now act as an OCR system and transcribe the text from the image:

Persons who reported the sighting flight of September 7, 1966 in the Dover, New Hampshire area from 10:10 to 10:45 p.m. was -  

When called from Wright-Patterson AFB, A.F. D.D. on Div. F. AF was unable to elicit much information re: this or any other sighting. Due to inability, if seen different object(s) or watch it travel. We could well account for this since we know lights alone can be deceiving and it is natural for witnesses to "be careful" as to height, course & speed, etc. of object. It is quite understandable that they would be somewhat evasive or reticent in reporting details of an incident of this nature.
