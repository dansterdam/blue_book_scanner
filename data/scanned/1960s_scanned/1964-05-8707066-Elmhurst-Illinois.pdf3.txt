This image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text appears to be a letter from J. Allen Hynek, the director of the Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University, addressed to a Major Hector Quintanilla of the Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.

The text is as follows:

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201
18 November 1964

Major Hector Quintanilla
Foreign Technology Division
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

I am enclosing the equatorial crossing sheets for Echo I and Echo II for the year 1964, to the present. I shall need you copies of the new sheets as they come along, as I have a good reason now to believe they will.

With reference to the Altus, Oklahoma sighting, 21 May 1964, that definitely has proved to be Echo II, as reference to the enclosed sheets will show. I believe the identification is positive.

The case of the Northwestern student from Elmhurst, Illinois is in abeyance. The student is no longer here, but is now resident in the Virgin Islands. I regret I can pursue that one any further. The sighting, in any case, contained very little information, and it does not seem practicable to try to get more out of this chap at the present time. Since we have gone this far, however, if you feel it worthwhile, my going and I here send a letter to him to see what he might bring forth. But I don't think it's much worthwhile.

What are your plans on concluding to visit us next week or the following? As you know, the rash of meteor sightings is scheduled to be in Mexico. I hope to be in New Mexico.

With respect to the Altus case, would it not be a good idea to drop a note to Mr. ---- and to let then know that they had seen Echo II? Good inter-Air Force relations.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
