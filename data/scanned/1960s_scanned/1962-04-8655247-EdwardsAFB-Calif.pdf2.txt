X-15 PILOT SHOWS HIS FILM

HOW JOE WALKER NEARLY BROKE THE NEWS

ON APRIL 17, 1962 PILOT JOE WALKER OF THE X-15 ROCKET RESEARCH AIRPLANE NEARLY BROKE THE NEWS THAT HE HAD PHOTOGRAPHED WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) FROM HIS ROCKET PLANE ALTITUDE OF 50 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH.

WALKER'S FILM SHOWED A METALLIC DISC-SHAPED OBJECT MANEUVERING NEAR HIS X-15 DURING THE FLIGHT. ON RETURNING TO EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, WALKER HANDED THE FILM TO BASE PHOTO INTERPRETERS FOR PROCESSING. HOWEVER, BEFORE THEY COULD COMPLETE THEIR ANALYSIS, WALKER'S DRAMATIC NEWS WAS ALMOST RELEASED TO THE PRESS.

WALKER HAD STARTED TO TELL NEWSMEN ABOUT HIS FILM AND THE UFO SIGHTING, BUT WAS STOPPED BY AIR FORCE OFFICERS WHO ORDERED STRICT SECRECY ON THE ENTIRE INCIDENT. THE FILM WAS THEN RUSHED TO THE PHOTO LABORATORIES FOR THOROUGH OPTICAL ANALYSIS.

AFTER CAREFUL SCREENING AND STUDY, AIR FORCE SPOKESMEN REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT ON WALKER'S FILM APPEARED TO BE A SMALL METALLIC OBJECT, POSSIBLY ANOTHER SATELLITE OR SPACE DEBRIS, RATHER THAN A STRANGER CRAFT. HOWEVER, MANY OUTSIDE INVESTIGATORS HAVE EXPRESSED THE BELIEF THAT THE OBJECT WAS DEFINITELY A UFO.

MEANWHILE THE AIR FORCE HAS MAINTAINED STRICT SECRECY ON WALKER'S FILM AND THE INCIDENT. IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE FULL DETAILS AND CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THE PHOTO INTERPRETERS HAVE BEEN FILED AWAY IN THE CLASSIFIED ANNALS OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK, THE AIR FORCE'S UFO INVESTIGATION AGENCY.
