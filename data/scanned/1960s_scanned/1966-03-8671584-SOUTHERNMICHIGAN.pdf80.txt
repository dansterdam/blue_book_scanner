The text in the document is as follows:

"The lighting was poor, and the object was only visible for a very short time. However, a competent observer described it as follows:

The object was large, approximately 50 feet in diameter, and was circular in shape. It was hovering at a height of about 500 feet and was completely silent. The color was described as a dull reddish-orange with no visible markings or protruding structures.

Other observations during the incident included the following:
While the object was hovering, the witness observed that the surrounding area was strangely lighted. This illumination seemed to emanate from the object itself. 
It would seem that the conclusion of the witnesses, with respect to the nature of the object, in these particular cases, is very clear. No group of individuals observed any craft coming to or leaving the scene. The sightings seem to be localized there. Definite physical evidence was observed such as the overall illumination, and a strange feeling of warmth which persisted even after the object had departed.
It is quite apparent to me from the balance of the evidence that there was no misidentification of conventional aircraft of any type. The illumination and heating effects, the silent hovering, and the definite circular shape all argue against any conventional explanation. Furthermore, the duration of the sighting, which was in excess of 10 minutes, eliminated the possibility of a meteor or other fleeting phenomenon.
I emphasize in conclusion that I arrive at a court of law that this material provides very little in the way of concrete data that might be used to identify the nature of these sightings. It does, however, constitute a valid report that cannot be dismissed lightly. More data will be needed before any definitive conclusions can be drawn."
