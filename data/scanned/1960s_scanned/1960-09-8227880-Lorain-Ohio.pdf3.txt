The image contains two sketches. The first sketch appears to depict an object in the sky, showing its position relative to the horizon. The second sketch shows a landscape scene with a road leading into the distance. There is also a smaller sketch in the lower right corner that appears to show an object with a curved top. The text below the sketches provides instructions on how to interpret and compare the sketches.

The text found in the document is as follows:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the object as it appears above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it, and a "B" on the position of the object when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
