Colonel Brendle:

Colonel Adkins received following from Jack Crawford, California Publishing Co., California, Mo.:

Two local, reliable business men reported an unidentified flying object at 0100 this morning, 30 Jan. It approached from the east from Russellville and went over the farm at which point it turned northwest; and flew directly over California, Mo. The object had lights that were white, green, and red and death blue, very bright, similar to Xmas tree lights. They were cycling very fast, no sound involved, estimated 1/2 mile high. The object was going up and down at varying rates of speed. Cannot estimate size or shape but stated the motion was too slow for a plane and too fast for a helicopter.
