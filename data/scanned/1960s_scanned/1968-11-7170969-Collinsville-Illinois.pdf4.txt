The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with a heading that reads "INFORMATION WHICH WOULD BE RESTRICTIVE, BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN ALTERNATIVES PROVIDED FOR EXPIATION OF THE SIGHTING."

Text found in the document:

27. INFORMATION WHICH WOULD BE RESTRICTIVE, BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN ALTERNATIVES PROVIDED FOR EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.
