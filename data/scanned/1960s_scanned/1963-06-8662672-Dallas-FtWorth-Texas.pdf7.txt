The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Dear Captain ******,

The 13 slides, which were forwarded to the Project Technical Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, is an object moving upward and to the left across the sky. It is another cylindrical and missile shaped object. The object photographed are probably parts of the equipment which the photographer was riding.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
