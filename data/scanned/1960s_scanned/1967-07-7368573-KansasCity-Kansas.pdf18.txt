Honorable Larry Winn

Dear Sir:

After spending some time with you, I am forwarded that I give you copies of the complete reports, letters, etc. relating to the sightings of a UFO from our residents in Leswood.

(You will note the complete indifference to this sighting by the) Air Force which I am pursuing this. It is the full belief that the UFO sighting here was of such inconsequential importance - while at the same time conscientious United States citizens have been ridiculed and suffered indignities.

Of most importance, in my opinion, of this particular sighting was the photographic possibility of recording hardware or proof of the existence of these objects. To my knowledge only one other such exploration has been seen and that was in Brazil. 

I would appreciate your comments and the opportunity to discuss briefly not only the contents and details of the report but my suggested plan for proper disposition.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
