implication that Sputnik and its attendant publicity was responsible for many "UFO" sightings.
In July, 1952, a set of visual and radar observations of unidentified flying objects over Washington, D.C. caused some public hysteria. Government concern was reflected in the establishment, by the Office of Scientific Intelligence of the Central Intelligence Agency, in November, 1952, of a special panel chaired by Professor H. P. Robertson, of the California Institute of Technology, to evaluate these reports. The Robertson panel thoroughly investigated the UFO reports to that date, and concluded that all were very probably natural phenomena, erroneously interpreted.
There have been strange objects seen in the sky ever since men first looked upwards. But the testimony of greatest reliability should be that of the professional astronomer. Professor J. L. Greenstein, of Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatories, California Institute of Technology, has pointed out that a vehicle 100 feet in diameter, at an altitude of 50 miles, would leave a broad track on photographic plates taken of the sky with large telescopes, a track easily distinguishable from those of ordinary astronomical objects such as stars, meteors, and comets. Nevertheless, the 5,000 plates of the Palomar Sky Survey and some half-million wide-angle, fast-lens photographs taken of the sky for other purposes reveal no such tracks.
