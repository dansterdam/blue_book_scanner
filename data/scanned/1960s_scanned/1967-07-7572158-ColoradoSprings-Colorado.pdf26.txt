27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to represent the highest point that the object reached. Then place a "B" on the same curved line to represent the lowest point that the object reached. Draw a line from "A" to "B" to show the path of the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, or "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
