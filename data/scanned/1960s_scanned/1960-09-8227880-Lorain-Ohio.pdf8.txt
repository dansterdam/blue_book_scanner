The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely from the Project Blue Book archives.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

The sightable object was observed by the witness at approximately 9:00 PM EWT on 8 September 1960 in the vicinity of Lorain, Ohio. The object was observed for about 10 minutes and was described as being round in shape, about the size of a basketball, and glowing a bright white-red color. The witness reported the object hovered for a few moments and then rapidly accelerated out of sight. The object was observed at an approximate altitude of 1,000 feet and was traveling at a high rate of speed.
