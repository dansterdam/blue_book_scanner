The image contains two sketches. The larger one appears to be a compass rose with directions labeled around the circumference. The smaller sketch shows a person standing in a landscape with mountains or hills on either side.

AS YOU IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A CURVED OR STRAIGHT LINE THAT SCHEMATICALLY SHOWS THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW THE PATH THE PHENOMENON TOOK RELATIVE TO LANDMARKS OR HORIZON USING ONE OR 2 OR MORE SIMPLE SYMBOLS OR ABBREVIATIONS, EVEN IF NOTHING IS SEEN BEYOND ANY "A" OR "B" POINTS.
