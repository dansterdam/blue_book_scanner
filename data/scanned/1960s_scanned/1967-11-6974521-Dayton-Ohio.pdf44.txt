There is no photograph present in the shared image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with a questionnaire-style form. 

Text from the document:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIMES?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR? 
GIVE OFF SMOKE OR GAS?
GLOW WITH ITS OWN LIGHT?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPLIT LIKE A SHOT?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?

ANOTHER PERSON

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Reappearance

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
That about it could see, at least.
