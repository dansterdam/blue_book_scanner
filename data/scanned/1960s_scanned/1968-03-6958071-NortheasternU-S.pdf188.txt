As long as broad. No long enduring train was reported. As to brightness, it certainly was much less than full moon, and several reported it as brighter than Venus. It showed a definite disk. There was more than usual agreement that the color was white-red. More recently Wright-Patterson Air Force Base informs me that the object was the end of a Russian ZOND satellite.
