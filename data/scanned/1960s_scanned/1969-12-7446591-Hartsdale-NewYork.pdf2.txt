Dear sir,

I have seen 2 UFO's in a 2 minute period. One had light, one red, and were they flew around at a round white light. This was at 9:45 P.M. It was going bright then stopped and hovered for one minute then it started going dim then it disappeared behind some trees. While I was looking for it another UFO came out of nowhere it was only in sight for about 10 seconds. It had a red, white, and another red flashing on and off. It couldn't have been a plane because it was moving so fast.

I have already told you about another UFO so please send me two forms for the two UFO's that I have seen.

Yours Truly

P.S. Please let me know what you find.
