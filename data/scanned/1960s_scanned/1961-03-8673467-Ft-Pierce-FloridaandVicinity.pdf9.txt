7 April 1961

Dear Mr. Planck:

Per telephone conversation with you on April 5th, I am writing to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 3rd concerning several sightings of unidentified flying objects in the Fort Pierce, Florida, and vicinity area on April 1st.

We have you an idea of one type of report we receive on this subject. We have you information on UFO sightings mentioned on this date from several observers and radio stations located on the lower west coast of Florida.

The information forwarded to you from Washington National office concerning my views on public statements, etc., will be appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
