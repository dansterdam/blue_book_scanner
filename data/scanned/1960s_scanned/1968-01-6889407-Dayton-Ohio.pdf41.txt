My observation was on January 6, 1968 at about 6:35 P.M. while driving a light green 1964 Ford Falcon station wagon on a country road between Dayton, Ohio and Carlisle, Ohio. The object was hovering approximately 100 feet in the air and appeared to be lighted from the inside. It was circular in shape and was about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object moved slowly at first and then accelerated rapidly and went out of sight. I did not see any beams of light or exhaust from the object. I could not make out any surface details on the object due to the distance and the bright illumination from the inside. The object was visible for about 2 to 3 minutes.
