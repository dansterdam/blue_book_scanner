The National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) has reported a wide range of human reactions to the space program. Some persons appear to be greatly excited by the conquest of space, while others are quite apathetic or even mildly disturbed. A number of individuals have reacted with anxiety or fear, and a few persons have exhibited more serious psychological problems, such as delusions or hallucinations, for a few seconds and then there was nothing unusual."
