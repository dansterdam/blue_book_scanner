Dear Colonel Gates:

I had a Marinette policeman call me Wednesday evening, March 
30th at 8:55 p.m. and report an unidentified flying object.
The object was sighting at an altitude of something
above 5,000 feet. The object had rotating red and green lights
and other colors and seemed to be moving up, down, sideways,
backwards and forwards as well as forward. It flew in a general
southwesterly and southeastly direction.

The sighting was by a Marvin Erdmann, a patrolman of the
Marinette City Police Department.

He had attended church at St. James Lutheran Church in
Marinette and the observation was made by a fireman and by the police man.

The man did not know where to report the UFO,so he called
me, apparently at the suggestion of someone.

I frankly do not know where these reports should be made, that is,
whether they should be made to the nearest Air Force base or
Area Commander, etc. Perhaps, it would be well to determine
this and issue instructions to the wing membership in your next
wing bulletin as to where these items might be reported and
what data should be reported with them.

Very sincerely yours,

Michael J. Asuata
Lt. Col. - CAP
Commander, Area One
Wisconsin Wing
