There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten responses to a questionnaire.

The text found in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The 2 went behind some trees that were there.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):  YES   NO   Don't know.
If moved behind: no there were no clouds, it seemed to just go behind the trees.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):  YES   NO   Don't know. 
In front of: no

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Well clear a whistling, not but nothing like a jet.
b. Color: Dark blue circular and the glowing part was very bright and like a light.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. If you had performed this experiment at the time of sighting, how much of the match head would the object have covered?
I could not have done this experiment as I just saw it fly behind the trees very rapidly. The object seemed to be the size of a dime held at arm's length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the shape of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or flames, or glow if present. Also show the direction in which the object was moving.
