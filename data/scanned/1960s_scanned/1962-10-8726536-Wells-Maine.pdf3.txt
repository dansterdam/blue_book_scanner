There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The saucer had small lights on the rear. A brilliant light was emitted from the underside and the entire circumference of the craft was outlined by a narrow ribbon of green light. It moved in a north-easterly direction at a point about 90° from the northern horizon about 50° from the western horizon. (Moved in a 20° path from any original position the saucer was northwesterly directed.)

The saucer appeared to dour down and its flight was erratic. It was seen for about 70 seconds. During this period, it appeared to become increasingly brighter. Then it shot straight upward at a steep angle, disappeared. 

I didn't know what this was, but I think some good guess might be:

"A meteoric or satellite

However, the spherical appearance and the constant change in lighting intensity instead of the usual flare up and then fade out typical of meteors, as well as the erratic flight path and sharp vertical departure, render this unlikely. The entire thing was witnessed through an entire atmospheric condition with no doubt as to its reality".
