Text from the document:

Yes, it definitely was. When I first saw the object, that was my first impression; it did not represent the same thing as the incineration of a star. I had that immediate impression. 

What did you think when you first saw it? I noticed the first impressions are rather helpful. What did you think you might be looking at?

But as I say that thought was dispelled almost immediately because of the fluctuations of the intensity. The explanation now given is that of a planet reflecting sunlight. However, when it first grew in the distance, my thought was that it might be landing lights of an aircraft. 

Do you suppose it could have been an experimental craft of some sort trying to burn through here? Did it have the impression of being a craft?

No it was not.

I am trying to think - there wasn't anything going on in that area at that time. This is the direction we are going in to find out. Whatever the object was, it did not seem to be doing anything out of the ordinary that would have attracted special attention.

Now, lets go back to the motion: first of all, was there any identifying sound?

None.

Okay, whatever it was, then lets say something about the manner in which it disappeared, and its second phase of motion. As far as you know, it was moving the whole time...

It was coming down from its altitude and decreasing the altitude. Unfortunately, the two that were observing it at the time were younger. That was the impression.

But after observing the object for some 5 or 10 minutes in the bright moonlight, it disappeared into the distance gradually, and it would estimate the altitude went back up again. It is hard to approximate that accurately.
