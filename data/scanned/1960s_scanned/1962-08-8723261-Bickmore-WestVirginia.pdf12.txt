Dear Sir:
On Aug 20, 1962 I intent to report the first sighting of a flying object. this object and several more objects made a report and on that date.
On the 20 Aug 62 pm it was a bright sunlight day about 4:30 pm I saw a bright object that reflected the sunlight very bright. it was hovering at about 5,000 ft. it moved up and down at very high speeds up to 600 mph and at times just hovered. It made a humming sound and disappeared into the air slowly. There was a backup object at the same time I watched it and it did the same flying maneuvers as the first object. The air force report on these objects which I made on the 27th of Aug confirms this sighting.
I request some information on this unusual sighting. The air force report an appara of this information.
Thank you,
