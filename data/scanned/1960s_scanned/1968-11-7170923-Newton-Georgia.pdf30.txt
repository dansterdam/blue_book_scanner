There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

Of the country, if you should ever like for me to help you in any way, conduct any interviews, I would like very much to pursue this entire subject.

Well good, I will certainly keep this very much in mind, because every once in a while, well, I like to have people in various parts of the country, so that when something comes up in that area I can call on them to get me a first hand report as soon as possible, you see, before things get cold.

Yes sir. Well I'd like to pursue the subject because it's the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me, I assure you.

I suppose I should ask you some routine questions, such as when were you, when did you last have any illness, or what is the general state of your health, and are you happily married I think that sort of stuff?

Well, very happily married. I have the flu so that's my last major illness. I've had ha the flu for the last three days and I think I've just about beat it.

At the time of the sighting, what was the state of your health?

At the time of the sighting I guess it had been 2 years or more since I had been anywhere near seriously ill.

Well, then, I'm not worried about that aspect of it, anyway. I'm sure that I feel that you wouldn't have any reason whatsoever for perpetrating a hoax, there's no need to.

No sir, it's been kind of funny. Everybody, well not everybody, will but several people have asked me how much money have you made off it yet? I haven't made any money and I don't intend to; now I believe I could come up with a better money-making scheme anyway if I wanted to.
