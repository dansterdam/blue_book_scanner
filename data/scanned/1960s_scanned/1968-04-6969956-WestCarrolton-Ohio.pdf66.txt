The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

"BEVERLY -- What has
startled these viewers so
they won't talk?

A U.F.O., that's what.
According to the finest
town gossips, that's why
these Sunday night viewers
haven't told to a soul what
they saw. But the strange looking
thing in the sky is more than
they can bring themselves to
keep, as at one time, just for
granted during the early
evening hours. Gus, a 55-year-
old cruiser, came into town
and as he thought it
might have been, a number
of persons are now
afraid to say much.
'We don't know what the
answer is, ' said one confident,
'But somebody explains it I'm not
saying anything.'"
