It appeared very solid, yet oddly illuminated. The interior was clearly visible as a bright light was plainly visible in the center which obstructed the observation distinctly for about 30 sec. As it moved away it seemed to become translucent, yet the illumination was still visible. The observer watched it disappear 4 1/2 miles east of Hillsdale. Duration of sighting was from 9:15 to 9:29 PM.
