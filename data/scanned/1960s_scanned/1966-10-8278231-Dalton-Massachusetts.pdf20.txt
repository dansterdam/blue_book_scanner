The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch shows an object or objects in the sky, along with a compass rose and angles labeled. The text below the sketch describes the motion and arrangement of the object(s).

Text extracted from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, and an arrow showing the direction during the course.

Fluttered up an angle then dropped straight down - then rose up an angle to the side from what I could tell as it was dark outside just at dusk.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Got 4 - one rose up to the right and 3 stayed in a straight line, some different heights, flew from left to east (right as looking at it).

Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Different heights in a line going across from left to right (looking at it). May go from Northeast to East at first, then more South.
