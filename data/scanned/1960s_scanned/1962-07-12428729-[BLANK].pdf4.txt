The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report discussing UFO sightings and the Air Force's policy regarding information disclosure. The text describes the difficulty of documenting reports of ball lightning, the Air Force's use of Geiger counter readings to investigate sightings, and the Air Force's efforts to provide the public with as much unclassified information about UFO sightings as possible.

Transcribed text:

Of ball lightning, it is impossible to have good documented reports on this phenomenon. In most cases, witnesses have reported interference with vehicle ignition, lights, radio, etc. Such interference, if actually occurring, could be due to the presence of the lightning or to the fact that the witness in his excitement may accidentally stall the car. Because ball lightning usually occurs immediately following a severe thunder storm, such factors as wet ignition, atmospheric static, etc., may be the cause for the reported trouble.

The Air Force has taken Geiger counter readings immediately after sightings but has yet to find any readings which vary significantly from the normal background of the area. Radar sightings are often supported by visual sightings because the same atmospheric conditions which produce visual anomalies may also effect radar.

It is Air Force policy to provide news media with information regarding UFO sightings which reach national prominence and to provide information to individuals in response to their specific requests. Further, the next edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica will carry an article on unidentified flying objects. This article, approved by the Air Force, was prepared by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Chairman of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern University, who has served as Air Force consultant to the UFO program since 1948.

In order that the public be provided with as much information as possible, every effort is made to keep UFO sightings unclassified.
