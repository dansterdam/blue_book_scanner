Friday, Feb. 4, 1966, 5:30 A.M. Mr. and I were in the kitchen when we heard a strange noise coming from outside. We ran outside and saw a very strange looking object hovering over the trees. I cannot correctly be explained. I have never seen anything like this before. The object became brighter and dimmer. When I first saw it I thought a plane was just above the tree line. It was 40-50 feet across and looked like a big airplane with no wings. It made a complete circle and came back to the same spot. At a tremendous speed it took off straight up and the sky cleared. After it was gone we did not hear any sound of an airplane. We felt no warmth and the object was about 20-30 feet above the ground. The object appeared a copper color and more like a well-polished mirror. We felt no heat even when the object was very bright.

On one side of the object there appeared to be a portholes with a blinking light on the other side. I couldn't understand the action. It was very fast and the object simply disappeared in the sky. I didn't notice any landing or takeoff, it was just there one minute and gone the next. There was no smoke and no noise made by the object during the entire observation. We watched it for about 5-10 minutes. It's very hard to explain.
