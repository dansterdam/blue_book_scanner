Lifted 450 and took off toward the south and descended in 2 or 3 seconds, or "two seconds", as he also said. As it took off, there was a considerable blast from the pine trees, bending it severely although it came back to normal shortly thereafter. We examined the trees; there were some broken branches on it, but no stated that that was not caused by the ship but had been caused by a snowplow some weeks previous.

After we had taken a number of pictures, and went over numerous points with him, we invited him to dinner and bounded into town. In the meantime resting a car from a garage so that we could look up the other people in the case. We had a rather lengthy dinner in which I attempted to draw him out on various topics, people seemed eager to converse, and he was reacted as though he was a very respected member of the community. I excused myself and went into the bar to strike up a conversation with people there, and both in the bar and outside in the street by the men it appeared that the man was known, and I was told that, although there were some rather voluble skeptics, I was advised to talk with him further, a man named [REDACTED] who I was told could tell me quite a bit about his case. [REDACTED] told us that he was instructed by the secret service to do this and not to talk about it.

[REDACTED] talked with Judge [REDACTED] and experienced great difficulty in being admitted to the house. Apparently the judge thought he was from the government trying to investigate the flying saucer people around there. The judge admitted immediately in house and his library had one line their device entirely to flying saucers people and other studies were carried by desire to know more concerning these apparent visitations.
