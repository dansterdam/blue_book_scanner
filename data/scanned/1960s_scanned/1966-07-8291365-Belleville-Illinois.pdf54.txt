The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document that appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report. The text in the document appears to be a response to a questionnaire, discussing various aspects related to the reporting of a UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 3rd May 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: The objects they are most likely powered by a sort of electricity taken from the atmosphere. They probably would use very strong magnetic fields which would be more storage space for such extra atoms atomic energy in some advanced form could provide just that type of power without having to much of a payload. However, if large objects like this came within a thousand feet of us there isn't a weight factor at all. You ask yourself how can these ships stay airborne without using huge amounts of chemical fuel. Probably they create some attractive fields around themselves which partly negate gravitational effects, and then too these fields could have forces of repulsion as well as attraction so that they don't have to fight gravitation all the way. someone probably has the key to this and that's not a good thing.
