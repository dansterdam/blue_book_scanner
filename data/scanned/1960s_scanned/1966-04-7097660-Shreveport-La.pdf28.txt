Dear Sir:
My name is Foley, Massachusetts. I am interested in U.F.O.'s and would like to know some information about them. I have viewed some of them - as I am including some. I am merely curious, nothing has happened to me personally. However, I am very interested in these things - and would appreciate any information you could give me.

Sincerely yours,

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,
