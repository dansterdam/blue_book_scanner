The image contains a sketch or illustration of what appears to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object is depicted as a rounded, egg-shaped form with a flattened top and undulating or rippling lines extending below it, suggesting some sort of energy or movement.

The text accompanying the sketch reads:

"CHINA PLASTIC LOOKING OBJECT WITH 21616 STREAMERS EXTENDING BELOW ENTIRE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE OF A 21616 NATURE."

At the bottom of the image, there is a handwritten signature that appears to say "M. K. Gy. 1-12-62" followed by what looks like a partially illegible word or initials.
