doing. Thursday afternoon I (Col. Warren) called, with the personal opinion that we needed technical assistance at that time and that is what we requested and we didn't get it and we have tried to do what we could. Gen Hollingsworth is interested.

Anyway, I'm sending the RAPCON TAPES, PHOTOS, and an overlay showing a movement of the aircraft, description of the aircraft movement prior to VFR aircraft was going through maneuvers and it would be most impossible to track it perfectly since he was doing steep turns, "S" turns, and how time and duration of the sighting was in my message. figure out the B-52 was in the TOX. I only stated one radar in the message because there was only one radar set. The ADC equipment wasn't been used. RAPCON was getting, I.F.F. equipment was operating in the airplane. It's a fairly good size blip. Every time it sweeps it shows the blip. The object would have been covered by the blip. They do a large slow to the south, Anyway, they do not remember having any contact, identified object on the plane. The unusual part is the B-52 was in the middle of a sentence and the young just split transmitting right in the middle of the word. Because we had an accident a couple of weeks ago we were quite interested. Ground control asked them if they had any trouble to give radar equate, the altitude changes, both our aircraft to operate was requested, and each time to show that they could receive they hit the "dash" gives when could use it for it to transmit.
