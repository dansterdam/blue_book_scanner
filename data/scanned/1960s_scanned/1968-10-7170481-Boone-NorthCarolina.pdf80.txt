VISUAL OBSERVATIONS OF BRIGHT OBJECT NEAR BOONE, NORTH CAROLINA
ON OCTOBER 7, 1968

On October 7, 1968, at approximately 9:30 p.m. EDT, observers at Camp Broadstone, 7 miles south of Boone, North Carolina, sighted an unidentified bright object in the sky. The object was first observed in the northern sky at an elevation of approximately 50 degrees. It moved slowly in a southeasterly direction, decreasing in elevation as it moved, until it disappeared below the southern horizon. 

The object was described as a bright, round, luminous body, about twice the apparent size of a star, and was observed for a period of approximately 5 to 10 minutes. No sound was heard and no trails or exhaust were observed. Conditions at the time were clear with no clouds in the sky.
