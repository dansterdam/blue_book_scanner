There is no photograph present in this image from the old UFO report document. The document contains a sketch or diagram with various compass and angle markings, as well as instructions for the viewer to imagine certain scenarios and draw additional sketches.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that.
