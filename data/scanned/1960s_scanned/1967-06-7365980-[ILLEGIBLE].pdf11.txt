1. Reference your recent observations of an unidentified flying object. There are a few points which need to be clarified before we reach our final conclusion. We have two completed TD forms indicating that the sighting occurred on June 27, 1967. One form states that the sighting was on the other side of your state, while the other form you submitted states that the sighting occurred in your immediate vicinity. If there was actually more than one sighting, please clarify the details.

2. In your letter of June 11, you indicated that the large UFO was hovering in the direction of Eagleville, Pennsylvania. According to our maps, Dupont is east of Pittston, yet in your letter you stated that the UFO was in the direction of the Dupont area. Please clarify the direction in which the object was observed.

3. We would appreciate a note from you clarifying the above discrepancies.
