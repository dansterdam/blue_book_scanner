The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a handwritten document or report.

To produce the text from the document, I have transcribed it as follows:

To object a definitely identifiable saucer seemed to appear rapidly as though dropped from about 52 feet directly overhead, stationary at first, then suddenly accelerating rapidly to the north, disappearing from sight in several seconds. The object was observed under good daylight conditions and it was definitely not a balloon, aircraft, or any other natural or man-made phenomena known to this observer. I am firmly convinced that I have observed at first hand a classic example of the type of unidentified flying object commonly referred to as a "flying saucer". I would appreciate any information or explanations available from your organization concerning this sighting. Thank you for your consideration of this report.
