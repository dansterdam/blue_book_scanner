Narrative:
Out coon hunting with friends. He got [inked] at an airplane flying which took his attention out to a small disk-shaped object coming towards him. As it came nearer it began to climb higher and seemed larger in size, changing shape as it flew. It made no sound whatever but he did notice condensation trails. As it got over his position, he said it became very bright and high. He thought he had seen two of these objects but was only sure of one. These object took off at a terrific speed. One said "I don't like this, I think I'll get out of here." He said he could not take pics' as he did not have a camera. He said the object was little larger (than a) silver dollar and round. He noticed it gave off a bright light as it flew across the sky. The object took off at an awful fast speed and was out of sight in about 10 to 15 seconds. On the way home he was shaky and excited while his wife sid he was pale and excited when he got home. Background Information: His wife said he was pale and excited when this all happened and wanted to go out and investigate further but it would have been dark. He had not told anyone until several days later, waiting until we picked him up. He seemed to be a truthful person and this was my opinion of him.
