To Colonel George F. Freeman, Jr.,
Office of Information,
Community Relations Division,
Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF,
WASHINGTON, D.C.

Dear Colonel Freeman,

Thank you for your December 21st letter explaining the nature of a fireball.

In case you and your colleagues are not already aware of this case, will you please inform them that this is a new case that I was not familiar with previously. It is just an unidentified fireball and not a fireball that becomes my identifiable as your face would be if you were to seek identification now.

Sincerely,
