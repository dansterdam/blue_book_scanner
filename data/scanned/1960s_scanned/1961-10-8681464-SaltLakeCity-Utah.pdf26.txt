Well, more or less blotted out. It raised a slight amount from the time we started watching it to the time it disappeared - but the actual - the last part that I saw - it was just more or less blotting out.

In regard to this unidentified object, when did you first sight it?
Just as I was making my takeoff run on Utah Central Airport.

From the best observation you had, could you describe the shape of this object? Well, it appeared to be a circular or elliptical shape, and it seemed to rock up to one side, it looked to be a perfect circle - it was still about 3-5 miles away from me at the closest point, so I couldn't determine it was circular, but it was definitely an elliptical shape, and it seemed to rock up and down.

Would this be called circular or would it be a disc shape?
Well, it was disc shaped, it wasn't like a balloon. It was more like a saucer. Thicker in the center and thinner toward the edges.
