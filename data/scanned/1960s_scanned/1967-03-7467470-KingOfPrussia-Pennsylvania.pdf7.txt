The image contains three small sketches or drawings that appear to be the writer's attempt to depict a UFO sighting. The text mentions that the writer photographed this UFO sighting, but the original photograph is not included in this scanned document.

Gentlemen,
Could you please send me some information on UFOs? Also, I think you would be interested in my story of a UFO.
In late August about 9:30 p.m., I was standing outside my aunts house (in Darlington, Pa.) and suddenly I finished putting on my shoe. I turned and saw what appeared to be the windows of a saucer about 25 feet in diameter and about 10 feet to the bottom. It whisped up and my camera snapped. I pulled out the film, but it made come Believe it and saw the camera for another second or two before it took off suddenly. 
I photographed this one.
If you request the photo, I will send you the original and a blowup of the saucer. This picture is, I think, good because you can see the windows of the craft.
Thank you for your consideration.
P.S. My address is: [redacted], KING OF PRUSSIA, PA. 19406

As requested, I have transcribed the full text from the document, excluding any identifying information.
