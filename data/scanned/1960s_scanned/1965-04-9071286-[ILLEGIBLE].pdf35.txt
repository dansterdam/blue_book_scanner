The image appears to show a page from an old UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book. The page contains a handwritten text in the upper portion, and a redacted image or graphic in the lower portion. Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.

Transcribing the text from the document:

"WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN, (NAME REDACTED)
TO ADD THIS TO PROJECT BLUE BOOK
WHAT INFORMATION CAN BE TAKEN FROM THIS LETTER."
