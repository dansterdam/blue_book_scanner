20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" on the path to show the direction of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course of the sighting.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a pencil at arm's length in line with the object. If you had performed this part of the sighting, how much of the pencil would have been covered by the object?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw.
