OFFICER IN CHARGE
OF UFO RECORDINGS: 
DEAR SIR:
PER INSTRUCTIONS OF STATE C.D.
AGENCY, I AM FORWARDING A UFO SIGHTING MADE
BY A MR. [REDACTED] OF ASHBY, ALONG WITH
A RIDER-PASSENGER IN HIS AUTO ON THE EVENING
OF MONDAY, APRIL 25, AT 8:10 P.M.
AS REPORTED TO MYSELF, THE OBJECT WAS HELICOPTER SHAPED WITH
FIRE OR FLAME EMITTING FROM THE TAIL SECTION.
UNDER SIDE APPEARED TO BE OPEN-MOUTHED
SHAPE AND OBJECT SWOOPED DOWN TO A LEVEL OF
APPROX 100 FEET ABOVE AUTO, CAUSING OCCUPANTS
TO BECOME HYSTERICAL. A BRIGHT BLUISH
LIGHT SEEMED TO DOMINATE THE OBJECT, ALTHOUGH
THERE WAS NO SOUND, PERHAPS DUE TO THE FACT
THAT THE HALFTRACK AUTO WAS TRAVELING AT
40 M.P.H. THUS BLOTTING OUT ANY OTHER SOUNDS.
