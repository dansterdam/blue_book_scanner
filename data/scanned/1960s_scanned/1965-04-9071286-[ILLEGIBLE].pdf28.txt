There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page of text from an old document, which appears to be part of a Project Blue Book UFO report. As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

This occurred to some object in the sky. It appeared to increase in size and brightness, then to become dimmer and smaller. It was observed for approximately thirty seconds, during which time its position did not change appreciably. The observed speed of any motion and the changes in apparent size and brightness were very slow. No sound was heard.

The witness stated that this object was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any conventional aircraft. It was also definitely not a meteor, star, planet, or any natural astronomical object. He called it a "flying saucer" and stated that it was definitely an "unidentified flying object" or UFO.
