I pulled my car over to the side of the road when I first saw the object in the northwest sky. It appeared to be changing in shape and brightness as I watched it for several minutes. The object did not move in a uniform fashion but seemed to dart from one position to another and even changed direction at one point. I have observed many aircraft over the years but have never seen anything quite like this before.
