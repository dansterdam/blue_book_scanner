18 February 1965

Dr. Condon, New York

Dear Dr. Condon,

I am still very much interested in the sighting which you made last April, but I am no closer to a solution than I was before. I write this to remind you that you promised to send the sketches of the sighting which I believe you said your wife made.

You were not certain whether the original sketches still exist, but you indicated that if they did not, you would prevail upon your wife to reproduce them as best she can from memory. I hope that you will be able to favor me with this in the near future as I would like to include them in the case file.

I trust that everything else is well with you and that you are carrying your camera around with you.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
