The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The document describes an observed object flying over Bayonne, New Jersey on May 2, 1960. The object is described as overhead and fallout at 300 to 500 yards, with a height similar to a traffic light and a cracking noise that may have been part of a satellite. The document is addressed to the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Akron, Ohio.

Dear Sirs:

The following observed this date 9:10 P. M. - Object Flying from East and falling due North West emiting a "zoom" and then a cracking noise as it fell in the vicinity of 33 St. this city - Description of objects -

- overhead and fallout at 300 to 500 yards, height similar to traffic light. 
- a pale complete blackout after the cracking noise
- no explosion.  It may have been part of a satellite. 
I do not think it was a falling star as the trajectory was quite different.

Witnessed also by 33 St. at the time. 

Very truly yours,
/s/
