Medina, New York

Dear Sir:

On August the 27th, we had a rainfall in Western New York and a number of the on closed pieces of soil came down with the rain. No one around here seems to know what they are, so I am enclosing a few pieces.

I would not bother with them but I recall reading a while back where you shot some samples and they disappeared. I thought if these pieces are some of them you would like to know about them.

Yours Sincerely

SMG
