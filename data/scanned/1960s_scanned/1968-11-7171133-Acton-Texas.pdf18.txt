1. Reference the UFO photograph taken by Mr. Paul H. Freund on 19 Nov 69 near Acton, Texas. Photographic analysis of the negative has been completed by our photo analysis. The results are as follows:

a. Examination and technical analysis of the print and corresponding negative furnished by Lieutenant Colonel Carter indicates that no retouching or manipulation of the image is evident. The question is, then, what is the significance of the various shapes and patterns which appear on the image? One obvious cause is the appearance of the negatives to be secondary exposure or the "objects" appearing in question. There appears to be some form of foreign substance on the surface of the film which may have been introduced during processing or some other means. The spot would be impossible to analyze without destroying the image. It is queGition whether this substance was introduced by accident or whether the "object" itself may have been responsible for the formation of the image in question.

b. Facts concerning the exposure of the film on which image in question appears: tend to confirm the probability that the "object" is a result of physical phenomena occurring within the camera. The facts are as follows:

(1) The photographer did not actually see the "object".
(2) Eight photos were made (the assumption is made that more than one photo covers the same general area) but the "object" appears on only one photo.
