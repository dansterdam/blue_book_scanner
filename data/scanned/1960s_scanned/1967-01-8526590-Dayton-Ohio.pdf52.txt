3/9/57 
ON SIGHT OF A GROUP OF UFOS IN THE AREA, WAS FILED THIS REPORT BY A HUMAN OBSERVER. ACCORDING TO HIM, HE SAW SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OVER THE HOUSES OF RESIDENTS IN HIS OWN HOMETOWN. THE MAN STATED THAT HIS WIFE AND TWO DAUGHTERS ALSO OBSERVED THIS UNUSUAL SIGHT.

MYSTERY OBJECT SEEN NEAR HOUSE IN WOODLAND AREA - SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS FLYING SAUCERS. THEY SAY THEY ARE AS PLAIN AS DAY. THEY FLEW SILENTLY ACROSS THE SKY. THERE WAS NO SOUND MADE BY IT. ONE WITNESS STEPPED OUTDOORS AND LOOKED UP IN THE SKY. HE SAID IT WAS A DISTANCE AWAY, BUT LOOK BIG AND BRIGHT. HE CALLED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS TO LOOK. THAT CLOSE IT HAD TO BE REAL. THE REPORT WAS THE SIXTH IN THIS SECTION IN RECENT DAYS ON SIMILAR TYPES OF REPORTED OBJECTS.
