On June 19, 1964, a strange encounter took place over North Dakota. The pilots of a Northwest Airlines flight 21 from Chicago to Minot, North Dakota, owner of an insurance agency and really company in Fargo, N.D., reported seeing what they describe as a strange light in the sky over Minot, N.D., about 20 miles east of Minot at 9:15 p.m. Pilot Dunnick, copilot Briggs, below and behind them at 22,000 feet, saw for several minutes the bright light, described as round and larger than a star, changing intensity. At times it was as bright as a searchlight. After several minutes, the distant object speeded up, its brightness fluctuating greatly. It made an abrupt turn and disappeared in a few seconds. The pilots, who were questioned by the Air Force after their return, were unable to give a satisfactory explanation for what they saw. They believed and said they saw an unidentified flying object.
FAA near the event area had no record of any aircraft in that area at that time, and stated the object was not one of theirs. The pilots were professional and credible witnesses.
