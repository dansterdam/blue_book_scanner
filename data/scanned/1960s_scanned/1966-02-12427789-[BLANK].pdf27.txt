ASTRONOMICAL SIGHTINGS

101 Cases contained objects evaluated as meteors. Evaluation is performed by analysis personnel within the section on the basis of description, motion, and duration. These analytical reports are reviewed for final evaluation. These reports are then forwarded to Dr. Charles P. Oliver of the American Meteor Society for whatever action he deems advisable.

135 Cases contained objects evaluated as stars/planets. These reports are evaluated by analysis personnel within the section on the basis of the object characteristics or the motion. Again, Hynek must concur with the analysis prior to evaluation of a report.

The astronomical (other) category can best be explained by an examination of those cases evaluated and placed in this category. Some of these cases are evaluated by local astronomers having a knowledge of the particular phenomena because of the locale and atmospheric conditions. Examples: The A.F. Combat, Sub C. Moon, and a few by analysis personnel within the section and the evaluation is concurred with by Dr. J. Allen Hynek (Project Consultant). Cases of sun-dogs and parhelias are forwarded to Dr. Donald Menzel because of his particular interest in these case studies.
