The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document that includes a compass illustration and instructions for the viewer to draw sketches based on the information provided.

The text on the page reads:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the compass card to show how high the object was above the horizon (top of sketch), and place a "B" on the compass card to show where you first saw it. Place a "C" on the "A" where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
