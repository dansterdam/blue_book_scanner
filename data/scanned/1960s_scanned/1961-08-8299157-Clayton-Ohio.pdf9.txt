The text in the document is as follows:
"This was not in the usual sighting. Someone I know saw a huge silvery object appear out of the sky a few feet above the ground. It is very fast and disappeared behind some trees. There appeared to be a lot of electrical or magnetic disturbance in the area and it is reported that several businesses and homes reported TV and radio interference."
"I PERSONALLY did not see the object."
"Being a retired Air Force Master Sergeant, I was called at 2332 on the night of the incident, since the man who called needed more information on how to report the incident. He was given instructions, and I was notified by the State Police headquarters of the matter. The local commanding officer was also informed at that time, since it was within his area of responsibility. B.A. Minnium, Major, USAF"
