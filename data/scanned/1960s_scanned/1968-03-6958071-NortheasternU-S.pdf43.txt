The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a newspaper or advertisement clipping promoting an event called the "Great Lakes of the South Outdoor Show" in Nashville, Tennessee.

MORE THAN 80,000 people from all over the Central South are expected to converge on Nashville, Tennessee, beginning Tuesday, February 13 for the 12th Annual Great Lakes of the South Outdoor Show. It will conclude with a matinee stage show at 3 p.m. on Sunday, February 18. Gates open each day at 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.

There is no question in our minds that this will be the biggest and most varied display ever for the outdoorsman ever seen in Nashville, declared Roy Steber, show director.

In addition to the many merchandise exhibits visitors to this year's show will also see an all-new, top calibre stage show each night at 8 p.m. and at 3 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.

The acts include: The Pompoff-Thedy Comedy act, making their first appearance; The Aacal Sisters, Willy Necker's amazing leaping Dalmatians, the finest dog act on stage today; Colonel Senbright and his amazing way pole act; Dave Overton, popular WSM radio personality, will make his first appearance as master of ceremonies; and finally Jack Gregory and his show band will put music to Music City's top stage show.

General admission still the lowest known in America - only 50 cents for adults and 25 cents for children. The proceeds go to Sunrise charities. Advance tickets may be bought from members of the Nashville Sentinel Club and at a number of business establishments throughout Metropolitan Nashville. This great show is brought to you as a community service by The Nashville Sentinel Club and The Nashville Tennessee.
