Whenever your findings are published in book form, it must be remembered that, due to security reasons, certain details cannot be divulged. The same applies to those who will be studying the observations along with you. While the text that could be read seems to be encouraging observers to come forward, it appears that some information has been intentionally removed or hidden from view.
