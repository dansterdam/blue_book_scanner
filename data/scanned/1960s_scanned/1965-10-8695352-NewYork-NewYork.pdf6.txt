There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The text has been transcribed as follows:

The saucer-shaped object had strange markings on it resembling lights from searchlights. Whenever the object appeared, it seemed to cast a light on the ground below.  Although we could not see what the object was, its appearance and behavior were very unusual and intriguing. The motion seemed controlled from within, unlike conventional aircraft, and the reflections beneath the object suggest some kind of lifting or antigravity effect.
