The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this image, only text. I will proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the output of all the text found in the document:

Phenomena in the sense, for instance, of precise angular velocities, precise spectroscopic analysis of the light, detailed photographic evidence, and all of the many things that we have learned to associate with the progress of science. Science cannot logically be concerned with, for instance, religious flights or indeed with any phenomena which are heterogeneous or singular. Let us suppose, for instance, that once every 100 years the earth were indeed visited, without fanfare, by interplanetary or interstellar beings. Unless all the paraphernalia of science were around at the time of the rare visit - telescopes, cameras, counter, tape recorders, and at least 100 scientists who could cross-check on each other, the incident would be sure to be passed off as a bit figment of the imagination, an hallucination - mass hallucination if you wish - a hoax, or what have you. My point is that the visitation would have to be documented as no other human experience in order to be accepted.
And this quite frightfully so. If such visitations occurred much more frequently, say once a week in various parts of the earth, but occurred at random and without the presence of scientists and their apparatus, a thing like that could so on for decades before a sufficient pattern of action behavior could be accumulated to be introduced into the court of science. We need remind ourselves only of the case of the meteorities to see that this is so. And the time factor in the background, the longer it went on the more would it tend to take on the aspect of a myth. In the case of such an event for instance, the longer it went undetected, the longer it would take to achieve a rational position.
