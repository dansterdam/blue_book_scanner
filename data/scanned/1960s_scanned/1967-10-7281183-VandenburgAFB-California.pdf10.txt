PAGE 5 UNCLASSIFIED 
REDUCED METRIC DATA CONFIRMED TARGETS BETWEEN 33,377 AND 63,000 FEET IN ALTITUDE. ALL TARGETS WERE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE WEST TO SOUTH WEST AREA. WELL ABOVE THE INVERSION CONDITIONS WITH RANGES VARYING FROM OVERHEAD THE TP-3-I RADAR TO 63,000 FEET IN HORIZONTAL RANGE. TARGET VELOCITIES VARIED FROM 23/62 FEET/SEC.
VISUAL SIGHTINGS COULD NOT BE CORRELATED WITH RADAR TARGETS. WITH SIMILAR WEATHER CONDITIONS EXISTING ON 9 OCT, AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO DUPLICATE RADAR TARGET ACQUISITION EXISTING THE NIGHT OF 6 OCT 1967. THE SAME METRIC RADARS DID LOCK ON TO MULTIPLE TARGETS OF STRONG SIGNAL STRENGTH IN VARIOUS WEST QUADRANT AZIMUTHS AND ELEVATIONS. NO VISUAL SIGHTINGS WERE ATTEMPTED OR REPORTED ON 9 OCT. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS INDICATED METRIC TRACKING RADAR DID TRACK EXCEEDINGLY STRONG TARGETS, WHICH TARGETS ARE TENTATIVELY IDENTIFIED AS POSSIBLY BEING CAUSED BY SOME KNOWN REFRACTIVE CONDITIONS. THE VISUAL SIGHTING MAY BE RELATED TO A MIRAGE EFFECT. FURTHER RADAR TESTS, IF ANY, AND A FOLLOW-ON REPORT, INCLUDING STATEMENTS OF VISUAL SIGHTINGS WILL BE FORWARD UNDER SEPARATE COVER.
