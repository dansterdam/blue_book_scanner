that the signal will be detectable on exactly the date programmed 
for observation? Kotel'nikov's final conclusion is that it may
be possible to discover a civilization of our type by our present
radio means if it exists on one star out of 106. If this figure
is one star out of 107 the discovery will be almost impossible,
and if a civilization exists only on one star out of 108 its
discovery will be impossible unless the radio apparatus becomes
much more efficient. The criteria of one civilization per 106
stars corresponds statistically to the limiting distance of 500
light years. Thus a distance of only 500 to 1,000 light years
must be considered as the limiting distance for interstellar
communications.
V.S. Troitskiy (ibid. pp 97-112) by an entirely different
line of reasoning comes to the same conclusion that even with
a narrow direction signal the limiting distance of a civilization
detectable by radio is about 1,000 light years. He estimates a
power requirement for this distance on the order of 1.6 x 1016
watts. A brief discussion of power requirements from a Soviet
reference is contained in Appendix III.  
The problem of what to transmit to stellar civilizations
and how to interpret signals received from them was only briefly
treated at the Byurakan Conference. A.V. Gladkiy (pp 145-146)
