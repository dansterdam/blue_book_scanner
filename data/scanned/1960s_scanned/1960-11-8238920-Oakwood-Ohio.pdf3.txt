There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a transcript of a conversation between two individuals, referred to as "Captain Saylor" and "Mr. [redacted]".

CAPTAIN SAYLOR: And did it happen any earlier to say  
MR. [redacted]: No, it was last night. It was so bright that  

CAPTAIN SAYLOR: Could you distinguish a definite shape to it?  
MR. [redacted]: Yes, it was triangular.  

CAPTAIN SAYLOR: Did it have any outline other than it?  
MR. [redacted]: It was like my flashlight was triangular on it and this glow all around it. It was about 18 inches or 2 feet in diameter.  

CAPTAIN SAYLOR: Could you make any estimate on size?  
MR. [redacted]: It was just like I say, first I thought it was a shooting star, then I got close to it and it was stationary. It was a bluish-white glow and it would gradually get bright and then gradually get dim but it was not a star because it didn't have the twinkle of a star.

CAPTAIN SAYLOR: Did you hear any sound or any noise?  
MR. [redacted]: There was no noise, no.  

CAPTAIN SAYLOR: I'll pass this on to the intelligence people.  
MR. [redacted]: Well, I was wondering if I have been doing too much flying and I have been thinking about it all day today and I thought maybe they could tell me something about it.  

CAPTAIN SAYLOR: That was all the information they may want. They may have more questions.
MR. [redacted]: Okay, tell them I'll tell you - I'm here at the store.  

CAPTAIN SAYLOR: And you spell your name.
MR. [redacted]: Well, thank you for calling in.
