Dear Col. Spaulding:

I am requesting all available information regarding the sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object over the eastern coast of the island of Trinidad on the 24th of January, 1958. Although the Brazilian Navy investigated the sighting, and in their intelligence report concluded the object, I understand the U.S. Air Force has also taken particular interest in this sighting area. The U.S. Air Force requested and received documents from the Brazilian Navy regarding the sighting in order to aid in our own investigation. I would like the documents were four photographs of the object which the U.S. government planned to use as part of the U.S. Air Force's investigation. Can you tell me what did the U.S. photographic advisors have to say regarding the photographs? I would also appreciate a reproduction of the detailed analysis sheet regarding the photographs.

Trusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience, I am

Very truly yours,
