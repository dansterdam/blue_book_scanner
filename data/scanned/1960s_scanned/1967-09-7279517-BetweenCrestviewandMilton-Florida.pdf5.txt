At about 1830 hrs on 7 September 1967, this writer was driving between Crestview and Milton in Okaloosa County, Florida, when he observed an extremely bright light in the sky about l0 degrees above the horizon to the southwest. The light was so bright that it was hard to look at and it appeared to be as big as the full moon. It was moving in a northeasterly direction at a very rapid speed. After watching it for a few seconds, it disappeared. I am unable to explain what this light was.
