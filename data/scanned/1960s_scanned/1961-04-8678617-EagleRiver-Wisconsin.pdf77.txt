Dear Mr. 

This is in reply to your letter to Brigadier General C. B. Grogan, Office of the Secretary of Defense, concerning a recent unidentified flying object (UFO) report.

The case book, according to Capt. Gregory, was involving a Mr. J----- who claims he observed an intensely bright light, surrounded by a reddish glow, hovering and maneuvering in the sky. The observer, who is known and respected as an astrophysicist, made detailed observations and sketches during the course of the investigation. However, it has not been possible to account for the indicated performance of the object under investigation. The materials Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the Geophysics Laboratory at Cambridge Research Center, and the Technical Intelligence Division at Evans Signal Laboratory have been unable to provide an explanation for the observed phenomena.

The case was the only evidence available in the case and there was only circumstantial evidence concerning the observer. No photographs were taken and it was the judgment of the investigating officers that the object as actually observed differed from the generally accepted characteristics of conventional aircraft.

A group of scientists, military and civilian, have been convened to study this case and similar reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. The Air Force is conducting extensive investigations, involving more than 7000 sightings, the accumulation and analysis of information in this program constitute part of a continuing long-range study of a phenomenon that is of great concern to the Air Force.

I hope the above information will be useful. If we can do anything further to assist your please let me know.

Sincerely,

OSCAR C. CRANSTON
