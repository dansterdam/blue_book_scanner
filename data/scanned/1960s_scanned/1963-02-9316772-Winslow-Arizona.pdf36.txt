ASTRONOMY

Mars Now Closest to Earth

The red planet Mars, closer than it has been for two years, shines brilliantly in the evening sky, James Stokley reports.

MARS, in the constellation Scorpio, is now shining with a distinctly red color. This near-earth visitor is now closer to the earth than it has been for two years. On Feb. 25, when it will be only 62,000,000 miles away, it will be nearer than at any other time until 1965. At that time, Mars will be the nearest on Feb. 10, when it will be 54,600,000 miles from the earth.

This is a favorable opposition of Mars, when the planet is on the same side of the sun as the earth. It is nearer to us than when it is in conjunction, when it is on the opposite side of the sun. The chart shows the positions of Mars and the earth in their orbits.

Mars is in Cancer. This is the constellation of Cancer, which is not a very conspicuous group of stars, and which does not include any very bright stars. But in the southern sky it is Regulus, the heart of the Lion, a first-magnitude star, which stands boldly above Mars, and somewhat to its right.

Higher and to the right of the great dog star, Sirius, is the constellation Orion, with its three stars in a row, known as Orion's Belt. Below Orion is the brilliant Procyon, and below that is the star Sirius, the dog star, James Stokley says.

Though Mars is the only planet shown, the chart also indicates the positions of some of the other planets. The symbols for the order of brightness are shown along the bottom.
