Dear Mr. Hynek,

I am writing this letter because my father and I witnessed a strange phenomena in the sky from our backyard around 8:00 PM on the evening of Dec. 13, 1966.

We were just standing outside looking up at the sky when suddenly a large bright light appeared. It hovered and maneuvered in a strange way and then suddenly shot straight up out of sight. It was a very cold and clear night. It seemed to be about the size of a small plane and was brighter than a star. It didn't seem to make any sound that we could hear. 

We were quite excited and intrigued by what we saw. It lasted probably around a couple of minutes. As near as I can determine it was not a commercial aircraft, satellite, or any ordinary sky phenomena that I am familiar with. I feel certain it was something extraordinary. I would appreciate any comments or information you can give me regarding this incident. A sighting of this nature is very unusual in this area. I hope you can tell me if this was something out of the ordinary or if you have had other similar reports.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
