Dear sir,
I am twelve years old and I am studying a little. I am very interested in your work. I am writing to try to find out some information concerning the incident in New Mexico where the fatal man claimed to see a flying saucer. I would greatly appreciate it if you could tell me what you know about it, as I am very interested. Sincerely April 25, a friend and I were looking through my telescope. We spotted something going across the sky. Firstly, I tried to get the telescope on it but had trouble doing so as it was moving very rapidly. But after a while it seemed to slow down and I could get my telescope on it. It was a circular object and I would guess it was about fifteen minutes later when it came back across. When I first sighted it it was going east to west and when I saw it again it was traveling with east to west. The object appeared to be glowing with a bluish white light. Have you ever heard of anything like this? Is there something you could tell me about it? I would appreciate any information you could give me.
