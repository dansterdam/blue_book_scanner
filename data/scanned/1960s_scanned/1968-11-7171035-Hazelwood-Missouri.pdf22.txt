Dear ,,

About a month ago a qoneral disturbance attractod very unusual craft 1 his craft Irna seen at least 5 different plocos in and around Dono/sue, Ohio. There were several calls to the craft and a phone report to the F.A.A. control tower at I-St. I,ouis municipal airport. 

Those iristances caused quite a stir and, in my opinion, warrant further investigotion. There wore several reliable witnesses who said that this craft hovored at timos and then took off at trrntendous speed disappearing from sight. Some said there was a red rlot-like glow around the top of the craft and that it semod to be controlled by some sort of remote device. 

One man said that he approached to within 300 to LOO yards of the craft and could see very definitely that it was circular or disc shaped. e
said it was very mach larger than a normal aircraft and made no sound at all.

About this craft, a friend works for the F.A.A. control tower and he said there was quite a lot of activity on their scope which couldn't be identified. lie thinks this part of the country is seeing quite an increasing number of these unidentified flying objects.

I hope I may on the other page.

I'll have a full roport written up soon and will send it to you.

Please acknowledge this report. I've tried to give you the highlights as accurately as possible.
