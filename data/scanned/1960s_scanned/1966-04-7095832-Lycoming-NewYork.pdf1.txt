11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer spotted the object through the wind screen as he was driving. The object was round and silvery in color. It appeared to be stationary at first, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. The observer could not determine any discernible features or outlines. The duration was approximately 60 seconds. Although it is possible that some type of aircraft or other conventional object could have been observed, such an explanation is not corroborated with the available information. Considering the available information, the case is being carried as unidentified.
