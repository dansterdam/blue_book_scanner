27 Sep 1966

TO: AFSC (FTD)

1. Reference our message 290IN 09010, dated 6 September 1966, on the UFO sighting reported by a civilian and by personnel of Finland AFS.

2. The initial report stated that the object was seen by personnel of Finley Indiana AFS.

3. The follow-up report submitted to this office by Lt Sumner, Intelligence Officer at Finland AFS, is forwarded as an attachment.

4. In the follow-up report, Lt Sumner mentions seeing another object the following evening (7 September 1966), which was also reported as a blue, green, and white light. This was similarly unintelligible and unexplainable.

5. On 7 September 1966, the witness, a Airman Second Class, reported seeing the object again. He watched it for less than two minutes as it moved to the southwest of Finland AFS.

6. The vague, contradictory, and confused nature of the reports makes it difficult to determine exactly what these people really saw, and such factors as time, direction, speed, or temperature inversions may have caused the sightings.
