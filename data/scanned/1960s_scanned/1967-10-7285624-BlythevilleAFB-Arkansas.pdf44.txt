1. THE AERIAL PHENOMENA OFFICE IS IN RECEIPT OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT FROM 13/16 MINUTES AFB, ARKANSAS WHICH OCCURRED ON 21 OCTOBER 1967, BETWEEN 0215 AND 0225 CDT. THE DURATION OF THE OBSERVATION WAS THIRTY TO FORTY-FIVE SECONDS.

2. THE OBSERVERS SIGHTED A BRIGHT WHITE OBJECT TO THE SOUTH OF THE BASE. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION AND WHEN APPEARED TO BE TWO WHITE LIGHTS OBJECTS WITH RED EXHAUSTS. THEY WERE DESCRIBED AS BEING SIMILAR TO JET AIRCRAFT. HOWEVER, THE RATE OF SPEED WAS MUCH GREATER THAN ANY JET AIRCRAFT KNOWN AT THAT TIME AND THERE WERE NO TARGETS ON RADAR THAT COULD BE CORRELATED TO THE VISUAL SIGHTING.

3. DID YOU RECEIVE ANY SIMILAR REPORTS FOR THIS DATE? WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AS TO A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THIS SIGHTING.

4. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED ASSISTANCE.
