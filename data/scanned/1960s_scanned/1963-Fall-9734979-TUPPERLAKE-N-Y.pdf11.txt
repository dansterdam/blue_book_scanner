Dear Sir:

Thanks for sending LIFE your picture of an unusual cloud formation, which you said a friend witnessed. We're sorry we can't use the picture. There's a rule in the magazine that we can't print anything that might be interpreted as a flying saucer, but we can't say exactly what it is.

We're returning the photo to you herewith. You might write to the United States Air Force, Technical Information Division, for any information they may have on this sighting. Unusual cloud formations are sometimes mistaken for flying objects.

Faithfully yours,

For the Editors
