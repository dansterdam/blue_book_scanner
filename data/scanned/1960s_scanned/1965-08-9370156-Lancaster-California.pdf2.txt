1. The following report of an UFO is submitted per para. 14, AFR 200-2 and 200-2A:

a. DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECTS:
(1) The larger of the two objects appeared round. The smaller object was shaped approximately like a fly wing. No empennage could be distinguished.
(2) The larger object compared in size with a pinhead when held at arm's length.
(3) The larger object was white when first sighted but changed to flashing lights (a bright/dim cycle) as it maneuvered. The smaller object was brownish-gray in color.
(4) There were two objects.
(5) The wing-shaped, smaller object was flying on the left side of the larger object. It then made an extremely rapid maneuver to the right side of the larger object, as viewed by the observer.
(6) Neither object had any discernable features or details.
(7) There was no trail, trail, or exhaust from either object.
(8) There was no sound associated with the sighting.
(9) There were two unusual features:
a.) The very rapid crossover (estimated to be over 3,000 mph) of the smaller object from the left side of the larger object to the right side.
b.) Both objects appeared to increase in size (distance) and then decrease in size (distance). There was no apparent lag by the smaller object due to the crossover.
