"Deep Fork Report Duel
"A comprehensive report dealing with details of a near-mid-air collision over Deep Fork.
"On the morning of Tuesday, August 3, a control tower operator at the Tulsa Municipal Airport reported a near-mid-air collision over the Deep Fork north of Tulsa. He said he witnessed the incident while working the day shift and directed the control of the aircraft involved.
"According to the report, the incident occurred around 7:05 a.m. and involved a civilian aircraft and a military jet. The civilian aircraft, a single-engine Cessna 150, was flown by a student pilot from Spartan School of Aeronautics. The military jet, a supersonic fighter, was on a training mission from Tinker Air Force Base. 
"The tower operator said he first noticed the two aircraft while they were at the 3,000-foot level and approximately 300 yards apart. He said the Cessna was traveling south and the jet was traveling east.
"He said the jet suddenly made a sharp 90-degree turn to the right and headed directly toward the Cessna. The Cessna pilot, seeing the jet approaching, immediately put his aircraft into a steep climb. The jet passed underneath the Cessna with only an estimated 20 to 25 yards of separation, the tower operator reported."
