Miss Turnure/SAF-OTC/76526/Oct 4, 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted],

We are returning the print that your friend, [redacted], submitted. Unfortunately, we are unable to make an accurate analysis of any photographs, we must have the original negatives.

The spots that show in the print, you understand, might be a flaw in the printing or in the emulsion, or there may be all sorts of different causes of the spots that appear on the print. For this reason, we are unable to send it to you, we shall try to get a determination of what these replicated spots actually are when we receive your negative.

In the meantime, we are sending your name material that may help you to determine what appears in your photograph.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
