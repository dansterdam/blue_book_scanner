SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 26 August 1965 - Amarillo, Texas
REFERENCE: ATIC MESSAGE 12-5641, 30 August 1965

TO: YFT(TDET)
WRIGHTPATTERSON AFB, OHIO 45433

The follow-up investigation failed to produce any relevant information. There was no evidence of a flight of fighter aircraft engaging in night refuelling operations with KC-135 tanker. Neither Cannon AFB, New Mexico, nor Holloman AFB, New Mexico, had any aircraft or flights which could be associated with this incident.

1. Mrs. XX, who had been very serious in reporting her sightings of lights in the sky on this occasion, was somewhat confused; however, on this occasion she had prepared a set of notes that indicate her enthusiasm may render her somewhat less reliable than a casual observer would be.

2. No evidence could be found that she had devised her evening's activities for most of the interval over which she claims to have sighted the lights. No sounds accompanied the sighted illumination.
