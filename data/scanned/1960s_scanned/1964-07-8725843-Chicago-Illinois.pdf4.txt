32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (outline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show the same object's higher position as it moved.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
