At approximately 2100 a strange and unusual light was observed to the north by my wife and me. It appeared to be hovering and at times descending and ascending. The light seemed to be elongated in shape and a rather bright and luminous body. It was silent. The light would increase in size and then diminish and occasionally disappear and reappear. It was observed for approximately one and a half hours. The direction it took from our observation point was to the north.
