SUBJECT: UFO
TO: Sara Hunt

Received call from Mr. on 30 July 1965. I took up investigating this information. At 0900, 25 July 1965, he described seeing an object traveling from east to west. At first he thought it was a shooting star, but as it descended in the object continued with a wobbling motion until it disappeared towards the horizon. At this point he lost sight of the object. He described the object to be larger and longer than wide. He does not know what this object might have been and if we cannot explain the object he would appreciate any reasonable information concerning satellites launched from east to west. Mr. [REDACTED]
