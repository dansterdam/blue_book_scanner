Identification of unidentified flying object (northern Canadian location 23 April 1962)

USAF
AGM-15 (col Levering)
DATE 23 JUL 63

1. Reference your letter, subject "Evaluation of Unidentified Flying Objects, North American Air Defense Command Project BLUE BOOK" and current interest disclosed in your letter dated 23 April 1962.

2. Review of the data reveals no record of artificial satellites and objects reveals that the sighting was not due to a man-made device.

3. A series of film tracks on a radar display was observed on 23 April 1962. This spectacular event only occurs about once in a lifetime.

4. In magnitude, this is bright enough to cast shadows on a dark background. there is no record of celestial objects within the usual description of these events. Estimated angular size was between 20 to 25 feet in diameter at a distance of 15-20 miles. Absolute velocity of the object is either reduced or increase to an incredible new technique.

5. The visual sighting could not be sustained at 3000 hours. The electronic tape recording verified the object at that time. The color of the object was a reddish-yellow and appeared to be self-luminous. The radar plot shows a continuous track showing a rapid acceleration and deceleration, which is not consistent with any known aircraft or meteor.
