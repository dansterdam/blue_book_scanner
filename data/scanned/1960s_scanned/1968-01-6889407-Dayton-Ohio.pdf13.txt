When I saw the 2 objects I didn't see anything to identify them. They were horizon-level and glowing. They seemed to be moving then stationary. I don't say anything to any one bout 8 days later. Friends came over and told me they saw the same objects the same night on the same horizon. Horizon partners were watching them. I saw where the ones I saw were. His is 5.3. Mine is 3.3.
