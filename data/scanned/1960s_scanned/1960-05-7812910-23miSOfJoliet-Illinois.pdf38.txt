Unfortunately, no one else that I know of has told you what I did which is:
I saw, on the evening of 3/22/54, at the time of 6:00 a.m. what I took to be a type of spacecraft, and since I had been a member of "ODC", and was familiar with almost all types of spacecraft, and satellites from his military service, I knew this was something strange. My sighting was from my home in Joliet, Illinois, and was observed for almost 15 mins. If you can contact me either at the above address or at my permanent residence at 144 West Naples, Joliet, Ill.

Sincerely yours,
