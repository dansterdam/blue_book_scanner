Here is the text from the document, with all sensitive information redacted:

Dear Sir,

I felt obligated to report the information contained herein concerning my observation of the unusual aerial phenomena on the night of [redacted]. I realize that my account may seem incredible, but I assure you that I am a serious observer and that I have endeavored to report the facts as accurately as possible.

On the evening of [redacted], at approximately [redacted], I observed a strange object in the sky over the [redacted] area. The object appeared to be dark in color and cigar-shaped, and it was moving at a tremendous speed. I immediately realized that this was no ordinary aircraft, and I watched it for several minutes as it executed a series of abrupt maneuvers that would have been impossible for a conventional airplane.

The object then appeared to hover briefly, before accelerating to an incredible velocity and disappearing from sight. I was unable to determine the exact altitude or distance of the object, but I can say with certainty that it was unlike anything I have ever seen in the sky before.

I hope that this report is of some use to you in your investigation of these matters. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
