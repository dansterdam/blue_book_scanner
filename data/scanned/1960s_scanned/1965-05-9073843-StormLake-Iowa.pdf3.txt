The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a letter from the Department of Defense Office of Public Information addressed to "Gentlemen" regarding an unidentified flying object sighting report from Storm Lake, Iowa on March 10, 1965. The letter requests that any appropriate information or materials that may have been obtained regarding this sighting be forwarded to the author, as they will be greatly appreciated.
