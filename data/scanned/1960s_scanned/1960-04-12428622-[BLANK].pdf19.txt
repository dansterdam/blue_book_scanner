They reported further that the little roots and rootlets
in this fertile soil were intact everywhere on the inner sur-
face of the hole and that not one had been cut, as would have
been the case if the excavation had been made in the normal

a long root still attached by the end of the root to the
soil at the bottom of the hole, with all its rootlets exposed
to the air, completely undamaged. In short, if we are to
accept this report made in concert by a small crowd and
investigated by Michel, it looked just as if the mass of
earth spread over the surrounding grass had been sucked out
by a gigantic vacuum.
The report stated further that while the villagers
still crowded around the edge of the hole, a lad arrived on
his bicycle, not knowing anything of what had been going on.

luminous object that was going toward the southeast and
