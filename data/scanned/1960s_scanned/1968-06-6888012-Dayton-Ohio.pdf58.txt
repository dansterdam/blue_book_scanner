The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with the results of an X-ray diffraction analysis. The text describes the analysis and conclusions regarding the composition of an "unidentified aerial object" that consisted of a "metallic face-centered cubic compound" with a unit-cell dimension agreeing with those of 1) austenitic steel, and 2) meteoric iron.

1) major constituent:
2) large constituents: "spinell-type compound", close
3) small minor constituents: goethite, u-Fe-O.OH
4) trace constituent: lepidocrocite, y-Fe-O.OH

The semi-quantitative spectrographic analysis results are provided, indicating the percentages by weight of the principal constituents. 

The conclusions state that the X-ray diffraction analysis indicated the unidentified aerial object consisted of a metallic face-centered cubic compound, with a unit-cell dimension agreeing with those of austenitic steel and meteoric iron. The semi-quantitative spectrographic analysis showed, however, that there was insufficient nickel present for the material to be of meteoric origin.
