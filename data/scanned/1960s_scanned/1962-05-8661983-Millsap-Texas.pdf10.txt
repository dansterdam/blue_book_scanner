There is no photograph or image present in this document. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, with handwritten text on the page.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how many times the object is covered by the match stick. If you had performed this experiment at the time, what would have been the result?
23. Did the object disappear, while you were watching it? If so, how?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a summary of the object or objects which you saw.

The text on the page appears to be responses provided by an eyewitness to questions about their observation of a UFO.
