SADDLE DESERT SHORES
JULY 15 - 1952

W.A.C.P.A. 
WASHINGTON-2$5 D.C.

SIRS:

WHAT I AM REPORTING WAY OR MAY NOT BE OF INTEREST TO YOUR 
OFFICE,NEVERTHELESS I AM MAKING THIS REPORT.

ON NIGHT OF 18 JULY 1952, FROM UR YARD OR SADDLE BUNCH BAY,NEAR 
KEY WEST, FLORIDA, AT APPROXIMATELY 9.05 P.M. EASTERN DAYLIGHT 
TIME, I OBSERVED A BRILLANT LIGHT OR OBJECT ASCENDING FROM THE 
LIGHTS OR BUOYANCY LIGHTS CLOSEST TO SHORE. THIS I WATCHED FOR 
SEVERAL MINUTES AS IT CLIMBED HIGHER AND HIGHER UNTIL IT BECAME 
LOST TO my VISION IT WAS ROUND IN SHAPE AND BRILLANTLY LIT UP 
AND TURNED TO A WHITE CLOUD OR VAPOR TRAIL AS IT CLIMBED.

WHILE SAID OBJECT WAS CLIMBING, SUDDENLY, ALL LIGHTS ON SHORE WENT 
OUT AND I COULD HEArR AN UNUSUAL NOISE, LIKE A SWISHING SOUND WHICH 
FADED OUT AND THEN ALL LIGHTS OR FIRE HAD DISAPPEARED.

THE SPEED OF THIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT THE SAME AS A BALLON 
THAT WAS VISIBLE TWO OR THREE MONTHS AGO AND DRIFTED VERY MUCH AS 
THIS OBJECT DID. IT WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE AND IT HAD A VERY BRIGHT 
LIGHT THAT FADED OUT COMPLETELY UNTIL I COULD NOT SEE IT ANY LONGER.
QUITE SURE IT WAS AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM MY LOCATION HERE.

ANOTHER THING I NOTICED ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE OF IMPORTANCE 
WHEN IT SUDDENLY FLASHED BRIGHT, IT SEEMED TO CAST A GLOW AND 
STREAK IN THE AIR THAT COULD BE SEEN. AND IT WAS TRAVELING AT A HIGH 
SPEED AND THINGS STILL SHOWED TRAVELED TOWARDS AND UPWARD. FROM THE MAIN
CLOUD.

ON THE CLOUD OR OTHERWISE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT FOR SEVERAL
MINUTES AGAIN. THE GLOW WOULD SEEM ENOUGH NOT TO BE FOLLOWING 
ANYTHING ELSE OR REFLECTING.

IF THIS WAS AS INDICATED A SATELLITE OR SOME OTHER SPACE VEHICLE
AND IT WAS SO DARK DISTANCE IT IS POSSIBLE IT HAS APPEARED IN THAT 
AREA. BUT I AM QUITE SURE IT HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO ANYTHING 
HAPPENED OVER ALABAMA OR MISSISSIPPI IN THAT AREA.

P/S I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS TO BE A FALLING STAR OR ANYTHING 
U FALLING STAR OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND.

THANK YOU
