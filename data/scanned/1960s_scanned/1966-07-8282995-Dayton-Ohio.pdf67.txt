The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically Report 10073. The page includes a form with various fields filled out, providing details about a UFO sighting that occurred on 6 July 66 in Dayton, Ohio. The observer noted seeing a very brilliant metallic silver object that made no sound and kept moving at a steady speed until it disappeared below the horizon. The object looked like two lines glued together with the edges filed down to give them a sharp edge. The sighting took place near sunset, and a high-flying aircraft would have been visible if it was illuminating the object. The sunset was at about 1955 on 6 July 66.
