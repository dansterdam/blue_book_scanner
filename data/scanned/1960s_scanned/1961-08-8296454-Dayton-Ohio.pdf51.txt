This page from the Project Blue Book document contains two illustrations, but no photographs.

The first illustration shows a sketched diagram with a curved line and several markings. It appears to be demonstrating how an object was observed above the horizon (skyline) when the witness first saw it.

The second illustration contains two sketched scenes. The larger one shows a road or path leading towards a town or village, with a person walking on the path. The smaller inset sketch depicts a rounded landform or hill in the distance.

As requested, here is the text transcribed from the page:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
