DEPT (UFO)
UFO Observation, 26 Jun 1969
Jacksonville, Florida 32216

Reference your UFO sighting of 26 Jun 69. On the basis of description, we feel that the stimulus for your sighting was probably a satellite. (These are over 1/100 objects in space.) Although we are unable to identify which object you sighted, we feel that your sighting was of one of these "man-made eye" satellites.
