Mysterious Light Observed Friday Evening
MANCHESTER, N.H. - Jan. 3, 1965
According to the report from the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, several men fishing in the Piscataquog River at Manchester, N.H. on the evening of Friday, January 1, 1965, observed a mysterious light in the sky.
The report states that at about 7:45 p.m., the men noticed a strange light overhead. According to their observations, the light appeared to be round and stationary, and varied in intensity from a bright glow to a dark dull red, then back to the bright glow. This cycling of intensity reportedly continued for about 30 minutes.
The light was estimated to be about 200 feet off the ground and about 100 yards from their position. The men said the light seemed to be about the size of a basketball at arm's length.
The report concludes that the "nature of the light was unexplained." No further details are provided.
