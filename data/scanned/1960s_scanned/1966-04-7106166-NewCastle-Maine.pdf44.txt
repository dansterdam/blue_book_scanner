UFO Sightings Reported From Stoughton To Quincy
These mysterious, red, white and purple lights flashed on and off as they moved around the sky. They were sighted first in Stoughton and then over Quincy.
James Erskine, 16, of 6 Pearl Street, Quincy was driving home from Stoughton when he saw the lights in the sky. He said although he did not see the whole object, the lights gave both a pulsating and glowing illumination.
The next and the other witness reported seeing an object in the sky which apparently performed evolutions. The object was said to appear very bright and gave forth a pulsating light. As it continued, the object was observed to make some sharp turns and changes in direction. The sound was as a slight hissing or sizzling.
Stoughton police were notified, and the sighting was reported to have been seen by several people. The duration was from 8:00 to 9:30 pm.
