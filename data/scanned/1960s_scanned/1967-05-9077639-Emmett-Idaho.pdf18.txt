MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 23 May 1967
Major Salyor spoke with Mr. Gorrono regarding his findings on the investigation of the 23 May 67 sighting by two boys. Major Salyor had first spoken with Mr. Gorrono, the attorney, regarding the boys' sighting. Mr. Gorrono contacted the two boys who supposedly observed the object, and talked with them. The boys had not told the truth. They informed Mr. Gorrono that a friend had given them the photograph and they thought it was a good chance to tell a story and see if anybody would come out and investigate the sighting. Major Salyor said he would write us a letter today informing us that the whole story had been made up. Major Salyor also said that he was writing a letter to the attorney, Mr. Gorrono, and suggest that he write a letter to his Senator explaining what had happened. Informed Major Salyor that if Major Quintanilla had any questions on the sighting he would call him.
