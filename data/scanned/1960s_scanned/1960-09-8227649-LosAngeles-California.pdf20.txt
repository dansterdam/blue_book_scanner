TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

On August 22, 1960, a letter was received from XXXXX XXX of Los Angeles, California, describing his sighting of an unidentified flying object on August 13, 1960. The letter stated:

"On August 13, 1960, at approximately 8:30 p.m., I was looking out my window toward the southwest sky. I observed a dark object in the sky, roughly the shape and size of a cigar. It was stationary for about 2 minutes, then began to move slowly in a northwesterly direction. After moving for about 30 seconds, it suddenly increased its speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds.

The object was a dark color and appeared to be about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. It was not blinking or flashing any lights. I have no idea what this object was, but it was definitely not an airplane, satellite, or any other known aircraft. I would like to know if there were any other reports of this same object in the Los Angeles area on that date."

The letter was forwarded to Project Blue Book for analysis and investigation.
