The Civilian Saucer Intelligence organization believes the investigation into this case is one of the most detailed and thorough conducted since the inception of the flying saucer controversy. The data collected seems to indicate that the physical evidence is sufficient to warrant serious consideration.

At 5:15 AM the observer, Mrs. X, was awakened by a strange noise and glowing light outside her home. Upon looking out of the window she observed a large saucer-shaped object hovering about 20 feet over a field adjacent to her home. The object was approximately 40 feet in diameter and 12 to 15 feet thick at the center. It was illuminated from within and appeared to be changing colors, going from a brilliant white to a dazzling blue-green and then to an amber tone. There was no sound associated with the object.

Mrs. X continued to observe the object for approximately 15 minutes before it suddenly shot up at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight. She immediately dressed and went outside to examine the field. There she found three distinct impressions in the soft earth, approximately 12 inches in diameter and spaced about 20 feet apart, forming an isosceles triangle. The center of each impression was slightly burned and had a greasy black substance on the edges.

Samples of the soil and vegetation from the area were collected and sent to the project laboratories for detailed analysis.
