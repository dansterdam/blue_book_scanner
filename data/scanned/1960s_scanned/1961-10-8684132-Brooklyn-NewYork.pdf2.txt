This image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. I will perform OCR (optical character recognition) to extract the text from the document:

Gentlemen,
The date on the sheet says Oct. 8, 1961. explaining. when i first came to the attention of the police. i stayed down from it to the bank which are short. when i got home, i made it out of a newspaper. but i didn't tell a person who it is. because, i know who the person it is. at a heavy report has enough evidence in it not to write to the to tell me what you know, it provided, hold answer it i know.
Thinking for your consideration
