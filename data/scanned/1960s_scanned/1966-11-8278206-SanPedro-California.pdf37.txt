The image appears to contain a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. It includes two sketches - one showing a simplified diagram illustrating the concept of an observer's horizon, and another depicting a compass-like navigational diagram. There is no photograph present in this particular image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the objects were above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw them. Place an "X" on the same curved line to show how high the objects were when you last saw them.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, and an "o" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
