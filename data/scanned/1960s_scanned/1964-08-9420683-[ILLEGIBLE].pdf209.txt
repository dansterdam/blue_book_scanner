Dr. and Mrs. _____, Calumet, Michigan

Several nights ago some friends of ours spotted some strange objects moving in the night sky when the children were in bed. Our friends watched for half an hour, to the houses and seemedstay in the stationary position. The lights were bright, white and steady, and not moving, as far as we could tell, now long the scene lasted.

It is difficult at a distance, to judge the size, but our friends calculate that the objects must have been very large, perhaps as big as airplanes, since they were visible for nearly every watching for these "saucers", part of the group was taken inside to bed. One of the visitors remarked that could we as we were as excited as they were.

One more thing: One might we saw some strange lights in the sky that made us very uneasy, but we watched intently for some time and the lights gradually faded away. The nature of the lights was such that I cannot adequately describe them. There was no sound, no running of motors or anything else, but a gradual brightening and then a gradual dimming, all within the space of a minute, or maybe less.
