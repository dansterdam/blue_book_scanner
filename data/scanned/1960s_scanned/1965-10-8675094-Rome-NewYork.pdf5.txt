The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

7. Identifying information on observer:
a. Civilian: Name [redacted], AGE 32, Mailing Address [redacted], Rome, N.Y., Occupation Newscaster and reporter for station WIRY, WRUN. Estimate of Reliability 99%.
b. Military: Name N/A, Grade, Organization, Duty, Estimate of Reliability.

8. Comments of reporting officer:
a. Action taken (personnel called, etc.) PAA and tower checked for known aircraft on radar. A USAF plane at 0553 EDT. No other reported traffic. No radar returns noted.
b. Final evaluation (accuracy, reliability, timeliness, etc.): The accuracy of this report is questionable. The person making the report is apparently responsible for reporting, according to the official information office. If the person was hallucinating or having some other mental issue, this reporting could be questionable. Observations around 0600 about this "sighting" seem to indicate as "hovering" visually of an object for 5-10 minutes, accompanied by "flashing brilliant light" on the object. It is reported that the object then accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared. This child object from a meteor seems extremely debatable.
