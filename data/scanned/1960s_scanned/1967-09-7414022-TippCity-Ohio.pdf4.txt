MEMO FOR THE RECORD: SIGHTING 20 SEP 67
Mr. - of Tipp City called and wanted to know if we had any UFO reports from last night. They had called the Miami County Sheriff, and a UFO land on the highway last night. The object was a tear drop with three white light and a tail with one red light. In the air the object looked about the size of a thumb! When it was on the ground on Rt 25-A it covered the road. There was no other traffic on the road. Object was on the road for about one minute. Turned the cycle around and by the time turned it around the object was gone. About 1/4 mile from object. It looked like it was on the ground but the light looked real high and then it looked like it was coming toward them. They first saw the object in the air. It came over us (the witness) and stood and then looked like it zig-zagged then went in the field. It was in the middle of the road glowing. About 1/2 mile from the object. First saw the object at 2315 about ten minutes later it landed. It did take off. There was something on the road after it left. There were telephone lines in the area. The UFO was lower than the lines. When the witnesses turned around to go back and see the object it was gone. They couldn't see it disappear because they thought their motorcycles were going to wreck when they turned around. They turned around at the intersection of 571 and 25A. The cornfield was on the right. They were on 25A south towards Vandalia. The object hooped and went on. Couldn't estimate the height and where was no noise. When the object came towards the witnesses it was fast. Went after object and almost turned over on cycle. Witnesses were: Tipp City phone.
