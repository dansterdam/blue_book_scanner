SUBJECT: INCREASE FROM DUTY OFFICERS' REPORT

TO: AFCIN-442 (MAJOR FRIAND)

The following, extracted from Captain Norton's Report dated 15 August 1962, is submitted for your information:

"0920 hours: A UFO report was made from Centerville (Dayton), Ohio. The object was described as an intense bright light, changing in size from the size of a large star to that of a car headlight, with a bluish-green color. The object moved erratically, then accelerated rapidly and was lost to sight. No other witnesses could be located. The Sulphur Grove Weather Station reported a bright light in the sky at about the same time, but could not determine its identity. This report is sent from 90,000 feet at 2200 hours."
