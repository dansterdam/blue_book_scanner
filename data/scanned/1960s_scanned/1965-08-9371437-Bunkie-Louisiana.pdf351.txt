Dear Sirs:

While on vacation in Valentine, Nebraska, I saw the photograph of one UFO (unidentified flying object) that I took on the second and third of August.

I have been a member of the Los Angeles Astronomical Society for several years, and have been observing for even longer. My objective in observing these objects is to determine what they are. I am sending this report of what I did see.

If you are willing to examine my report and photos, please notify me, and the data will be forthcoming.
