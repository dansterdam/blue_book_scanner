FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
January-March 66

Penge mystery
Reader V. K. Stanoevic of 29 Montpelier Grove, London, S.E.20, sent us the following account: "Last night, October 27, 1965, as I was driving home, I noticed a strange object hovering silently about 200 yards away from us, standing in the car park of the Crooked Billet Garage when my friend and I first saw it. As we approached it, moving away from us to our left and up and away from us, I continued driving this way, I suddenly realised the car headlamps were swinging wildly away from the object as I was pointing them straight at it. About 10-15 seconds it started to get brighter and brighter and then it suddenly became a brilliant white. Once again it moved, this time I have no idea how high it went, but in around 5 seconds it was a mere speck and had gone completely. It did not appear again. The whole incident took about one minute, I have no idea how high it was, but on ground of where I was standing, I could see it quite clearly. P.S. I hope this will confirm some-
