INTRODUCTION
On October 21, 1966, at about 0100, EDT, policemen at Patchogue, Long Island, sighted an object over the ocean to the southeast. They reported this object as flashing red, green, and blue, and as being extremely bright. The object would occasionally rise and fall, and dart side to side, however, it always returned to the same place. Over a period of hours the object traveled very slowly to the right and up; it was observed by some of the policemen until dawn.

This incident was reported to the Suffolk County Air Force base by the policemen, who called while the event was in progress. The press claiming the story, probably not from all the witnesses, and printed stories about a "hot dog shaped" object hovering near Patchogue. During the following nine days, SCAFD received about 50 reports of UFO's, the local police in various towns receiving several times that number.

On October 29, 1966, we investigators from Project Blue Book arrived at the L.W. Wilkins Manley, and Mr. William Powers, civilian consultants. Lt. Marley is a member of the Blue Book staff at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and is in the field of metallurgy. Mr. Powers is from the Dearborn Observatory of Northwestern University, where he is in charge of design and development of electronic-optical systems. Mr. Powers is also familiar with astronomical phenomena and photographic techniques.
