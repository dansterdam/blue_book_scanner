Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your letter of 9 February 1967 reporting a recent unidentified flying object by yourself and other witnesses. The information submitted to the Air Force by way of your letter is insufficient for a detailed study. It is requested that you complete the enclosed AF Form 164 so that a more comprehensive evaluation is possible. We would also appreciate it if your wife and [redacted] would complete the Form 164.

We do not discourage the release of any type of information. This is your privilege and not that of the Air Force.

FTD Form 164, 4 cys
