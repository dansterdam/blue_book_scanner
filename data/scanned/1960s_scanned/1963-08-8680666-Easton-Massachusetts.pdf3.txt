Dear Major Cooke,
I am in receipt of your very informative letter explaining the fact that my detailed sketch was not considered a remote or significant phenomena. Thank you, sir, and as I mentioned, I only see it fair to ask you for further investigation, please. I found the things you mentioned on this case interesting.
Dr. xxx's investigation in the past (31) cases found "almost identically" that there is a insignificant or questionable for us normal phenomena.
From the fact to believe this - I have against the Air R - which suggests the aid "Rain Explosion" (and) for me on this phenomena?
Deep Hole, Sub. iii?
