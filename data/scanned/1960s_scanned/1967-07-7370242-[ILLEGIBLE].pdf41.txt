The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page shows an official United States Air Force envelope addressed to "WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO" with the text "POSTAGE AND FEES PAID" and "FIRST CLASS" printed on it. The envelope also has a postmark date stamp and handwritten text that says "NO SUCH STREET" and some additional handwritten text that is illegible.
