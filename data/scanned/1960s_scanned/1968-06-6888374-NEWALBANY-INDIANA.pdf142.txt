The image appears to contain a questionnaire form titled "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE" from the US Air Force's Project Blue Book. The form includes sections for the observer to fill out details about the sighting, such as the date, time, and location. Additionally, there is a diagram that the observer is instructed to use to indicate the position of the phenomenon relative to the horizon. However, the image does not appear to contain any photographs or visual evidence of the sighted phenomenon.
