There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, likely containing text and details regarding a UFO sighting or report.

The sound occurred after she had heard a siren going down the street. The sound lasted less than 5 minutes. She had the impression that it disappeared as quickly as it came. When she looked outside, she saw nothing. She informed the official of this event, and he seemed certain that she could not have been mistaken. The sound sounded more like a sonic boom than any other noise she had heard. The authorities tried to locate the source of the sound, but could not find anything. The text mentions that the witness's name is blocked out.
