HISTORY OF PROJECT

Following the Kenneth Arnold sighting on 24 June 1947, wide news coverage of public reports of "flying discs or saucers" created sufficient concern at high military echelons to conduct a preliminary investigation into these reports. Early correspondence indicates that U.S. military leaders were concerned that U.S. aircraft configurations were being reported were an airctaft not previously conceived of by the United States or its allies.

On 30 December 1947, a letter from the Chief of Staff directed AMC to distribute to interested Government Agencies and contractors all information concerning UFO sightings and phenomena in the atmosphere which can be of concern to the National Security...

The Technical Intelligence Division of AMC issued a report on 16 December 1948. A report released in February 1949 covering analysis of the first 243 incidents concluded that, while no definite and conclusive evidence existed, evaluation of reports of unidentified objects was a necessity.

After the Project "SIGN" Report, work continued along the same lines and a Project "GRUDGE" Report was published and released in August 1949 by AMC. This report contained analysis of 244 cases and concluded that Unidentified Objects: a) misinterpretation of conventional objects, b) mass hysteria or "War Nerves", c) hoaxes and/or d) psychopathological persons. This work was performed under contract by Ohio State University.

Following publication of the "GRUDGE" Report, the Air Force continued to investigate sightings, inasmuch as it is an Air Force responsibility to identify aerial phenomena. In January 1953, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) possibly was a motive to continue the USAF investigation. 1952 and 1953 centered around Project "Twinkle" and the Green Fireball studies of Dr. LaPaz in the Southwestern United States. Project "Twinkle" Final Report was completed on 27 December 1951. During December 1951 Colonel Richard and Lt. Ruppelt made a visit to a private industrial firm to discuss the feasibility of a scientific study from the data collected since the program's inception.
