The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a handwritten document or form. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will proceed to extract all the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 27 Day 6 Month 66 Year
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative description of your sighting:

This is an almost a true picture of a recent sighting, early morning shortly after sunrise. This occurred at my home, 7 miles north of Spooner, Wisconsin (Washburn County), on a small rural dirt road. The sighting lasted about 30 seconds, during which time the object, described as varying in size, maneuvered rapidly, appeared to make slight course corrections, accelerated rapidly out of sight to the northwest at an amazing speed. This is an extremely good, bright, daytime sighting, quite unmatched, as far as I am concerned, with anything of this nature that I have experienced or observed on television. Careful analysis would indicate that this was not a conventional aircraft, balloon, satellite, meteor, or any other known object. This was a maneuverable, intelligently controlled object of unknown origin, either from this earth or elsewhere, moving at a fantastic speed compared to anything with which I am familiar.
