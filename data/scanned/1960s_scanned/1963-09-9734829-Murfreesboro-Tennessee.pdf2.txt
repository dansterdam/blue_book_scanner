AKRON, OHIO
A large, luminous object was observed in the sky which abruptly changed directions and moved away at a high rate of speed on September 13,.... 7:15 pm
The object was described as disc-shaped, luminous white in color, and approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter. It was observed for about 15 minutes, during which time it did not move continuously but made several abrupt stops and changes of direction. At one point, the object appeared to alternately brighten and dim. Its brightness diminished until it was no longer visible.
The witness stated that it did not make any sound and that if it had been an aircraft of any kind, it would have been identified as such. It was observed to the left and above the witness. The witness was certain that the object and its maneuvers were not characteristic of any known aircraft.
It was further reported that the object was seen by several other persons in the area, and its presence was confirmed by the police. The report indicates that the case was investigated and the object remains unidentified.
