Dear Major Quintanilla:
On December 9, shortly before 5 p.m., a bright light was observed in the sky. The light was traveling in a northwest direction and was observed for about 90 degrees of travel before disappearing. Directly with the flash traveled to the east and was estimated about 100 degrees away and declined at about 30 degrees elevation. The duration of the entire observation was approximately 3 to 4 seconds. From the time it was first observed, it appeared to be diminishing in intensity and ended abruptly.
