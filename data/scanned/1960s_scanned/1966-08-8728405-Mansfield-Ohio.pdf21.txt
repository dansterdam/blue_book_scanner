The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page reads:

It cut the right-hand window, the pilot had to lift the right wing slightly. The size of the object then appeared to be about the same as the chord of the wing at its tip (3 - 4 feet at that distance). At the closest approach, which the pilot estimates to have been one city block, the object was considerably larger in angular diameter.

The pilot then called Roschester Airport and reported the object, asking if any other pilots had reported anything; none had. Five minutes later, however, the pilot heard reports from two other aircraft, one a Cherokee, reporting a similar appearing object.
