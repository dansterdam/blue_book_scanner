ignited by a spontaneous oxidation of the impurity PH3. The will-o'-the-wisp, sometimes observed in marshes, may be due to spontaneous ignition of impure PH3, which might be formed by reduction of naturally occurring phosphorus compounds.

Other scientists have pointed out to me that in swamps the formation of H2S and CH4 from rotting vegetation is common. These could be ignited by the spontaneous burning of the Phosphine, PH3.

It would seem to me that the association of the sightings with swamps, in these particular cases, is more than coincidence. No group of witnesses observed any craft coming to or going away from the swamp. The glow was localized there. Deputy Fitzpatrick described the glow as coming from beyond a rise adjacent to the swamp...and visible through the trees. He stated that the lights brightened and dimmed much as stage lights do—smoothly and slowly. The girls at Hillsdale described almost the identical things. This could have been due to the release of variable quantities of marsh gas.

The disappearance of the light when people got close with flashlights or car lights, would indicate that the glow seemed bright only to dark-adapted eyes. The light would have been their weak signal to the moon. In order to see the lights in the swamp, their eyes had to adapt in order to see the lights in the swamp.

I emphasize in conclusion that I cannot prove in a Court of Law that this is the full explanation of these sightings. It appears very likely, however, that the combination of the conditions of this particular winter, an unusually mild one in this area, and the particular weather conditions that night—there was little wind at either location—were such as to have produced this unusual and puzzling display.
