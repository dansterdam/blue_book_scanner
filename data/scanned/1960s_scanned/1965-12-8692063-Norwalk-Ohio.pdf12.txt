MEMO FOR THE RECORD
called 3 December 1955 at 1535 and informed the project office that a number of people in and around have seen a mysterious object in the sky at dusk and immediately thereafter. He claims that this object is emitting some sort of radiation. He also claims that the National Guard in that area took a Geiger Counter measurement and that it was positive. The National Guard is allegedly sending the information to the project office. I have requested that he send me all the information available so that we can evaluate the observation.
