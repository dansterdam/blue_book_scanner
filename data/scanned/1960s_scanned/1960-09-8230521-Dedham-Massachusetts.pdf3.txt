Narrative: (detailed description of what was observed):
While observing what appeared to be a fixed celestial object or star, I noticed an object with the above characteristics move into the field of view. The object was definitely metallic in appearance and seemed to be hovering, then drifting slightly upward, and then hovering again. I watched it for approximately 30-35 minutes. At no time did it leave the general area of the sky it had first appeared in, and it seemed to hang motionless for the most part. The metallic surface reflected the starlight. At one point, it appeared to change in brightness slightly. The object did not seem to be an aircraft. Did it change direction? NO

Careful consideration of all aspects:
(Note: In the upper right, a marginal note says "4/23 - Additional information... - see back")
On the upper, 2 men in conversation, 10 mph, for several minutes, disappeared upward into the clouds and stars (as seen).
