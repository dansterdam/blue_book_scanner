The image contains two illustrated sketches. The first sketch is a compass rose diagram with the cardinal directions labeled. The second sketch shows two landscape illustrations - one shows a person standing on a road with mountains or hills in the background, and the other shows a person standing on a road with a UFO or unidentified object in the sky above.

8A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED. (QUICKLY SKETCH IN SOME DETAILS OF THE COMPASS ROSE).

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED. COMPLETE THE SKETCH WITH ADDITIONAL DETAILS SUCH AS THE APPEARANCE OF THE PHENOMENON (WHETHER IT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG). REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE LARGER SKETCH.
