Dear sir, 
This report is in reference to a strange phenomenon which was observed by members of the St. Mary Ranger Station at Glacier National Park, Montana. The object of the light appeared to be of a glowing nature and was described as being circular in shape. Its size was estimated to be approximately 20-30 feet in diameter. The object was observed for a period of about 3 minutes as it hovered and maneuvered in the sky. No sound was associated with the object. The object eventually accelerated and disappeared from sight. This report is being submitted for your information and further investigation as deemed necessary.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
