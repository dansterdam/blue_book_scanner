Comet Ikeya-Seki

On October 21, 1965, a comet was sighted that was traveling rapidly across the northern sky. This comet, named Ikeya-Seki, was first discovered on September 18, 1965, by two Japanese amateur astronomers, Kaoru Ikeya and Tsutomu Seki.

The comet was observed to be very bright and showed a long, fan-shaped tail. It passed very close to the sun, within 450,000 miles, on October 21, 1965, and was visible for several weeks thereafter.

Observers noted that the comet's tail appeared to be composed of two distinct parts - a narrow, bright inner tail and a broader, fainter outer tail. The comet's nucleus was also observed to be extremely bright, with a magnitude of -10 at its peak.

Ikeya-Seki was one of the brightest comets of the 20th century, and its close passage to the sun provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the effects of intense solar radiation on a comet's structure and behavior.
