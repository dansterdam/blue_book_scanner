Transcription of the text in the document:

"The thing, moving at a tremendous rate of speed, was sighted over Sierra Vista, Arizona on 7 July 1968. The observer, a science teacher, reported that the object was first sighted at 10:06 PM and observed for approximately 30 seconds. He described the object as metallic, reflecting the light and about the size of a small car. The object was moving at an estimated speed of 1000-3000 mph and traveling in a straight, level direction from the southwest to the northeast. The witness stated that the object's speed and maneuverability were unlike any conventional aircraft he had ever seen. He discounted the possibility of the object being a satellite, meteor, or other natural phenomenon. The observer is considered a reliable source with no history of erratic behavior or questionable mental health issues."
