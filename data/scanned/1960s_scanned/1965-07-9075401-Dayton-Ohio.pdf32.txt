HE SAID IT IS PROBABLE THAT SOME WERE STILL VISIBLE OVER PENNSYLVANIA, WEST VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND ON MONDAY NIGHT. SOME PERSONS SAID IT APPEARED THAT SOME OF THEM BROKE UP.

Portugal Reports UFO Sightings

LISBON, Portugal (UPI)  Several Portuguese military personnel reported seeing an odd object moving through the skies over Portugal last week.

The first, reported "mysterious object" appeared over the northern city of Oporto, where Manuel Fernandes and his wife saw a bright object in the sky for several minutes.

They reported it looked like a luminous cigar. Several other witnesses in the area also reported the same sighting.

The second incident was reported from the Azores islands, where Jose Viale, a Radio announcer at Ponta Delgada, on the island of Sao Miguel, reported seeing a bright, fast-moving object in the sky for about 10 minutes.

No other details were available on these incidents.
