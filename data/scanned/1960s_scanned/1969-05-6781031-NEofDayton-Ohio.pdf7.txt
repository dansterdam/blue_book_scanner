The shared image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

This bright light field appeared somewhat near to the object and slightly below it. It appeared to be some sort of side effect or distortion. It appeared to be about 75 yards from the observer. The object was observed through binoculars. It appeared to be rounded and solid looking. There seemed to one other sighting to be the intensity from binoculars. The object was observed for about 15-20 minutes and then slowly faded out of sight. The night was somewhat hazy and there were some ground hazes and mirages observed on this night. This appears to be a detailed account of a UFO sighting.
