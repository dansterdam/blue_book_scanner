II. BRIEF SUMMARY OF CASE
OBSERVATIONS - The caller stated that he observed a "bright light" which moved in the sky. The light was first observed at approximately 12:45 a.m. and was visible for about 5 to 10 minutes. The light was described as being quite bright and it never remained stationary, but moved in an erratic manner. The observer was unable to estimate the size, speed or altitude of the object, but stated that it seemed to be at a considerable distance. The light was not visible when the observation was completed.
