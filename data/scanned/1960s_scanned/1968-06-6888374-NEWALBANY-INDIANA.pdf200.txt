when we first sighted it. it was clear, not clouded over, and as near as we could see the objects outline, it seemed to be clear like glass, not dight at all at first. it then began to glow with a light yellowish color and the object seemed to get larger or closer to us, the light got stronger i the very center, and the outline became blurred or hazy, like we could not see the very edge of the object. the light seemed to be coming from within the object, not reflected from anything outside it. it changed directions several times some very abrupt while we watch it, also moved very rapidly at times until it disappeared from my view.
