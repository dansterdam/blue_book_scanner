Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear Sirs,
I received your letter requesting that I analyze the object I found in Bristol on July 3, 1967. My friend and I came across it, and some research of Bristol showed there is previously some reasonable explanation for what we saw. We should be retold if there is a reason why I cannot mail you the object. On the cards in morning 5:30 am I saw. My cousin confirmed seeing it and the time was relatively the same. It was a clear night and got up as soon as possible to get a good look. Of course my cousin was several miles away and it was situated straight down. It was a bright and very strange thing up there in the sky for some time. We both felt that was of a strange nature and might have turned out to be one of those not-of-this-world things. Could you suggest a reason why I may not be to mail you the object or should I attempt to recover it and get it to you? I will be waiting for your response.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
