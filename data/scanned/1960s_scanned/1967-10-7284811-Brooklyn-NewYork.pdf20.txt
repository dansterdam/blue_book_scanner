November 9, 1966
BROOKLYN, N.Y. 11293

HQ USAF
Washington D.C. 20330
Gentlemen:

On October 8, 1966 I sent a photograph and negative of a UFO, which was taken at Saint Thomas Island in October of 1967, to the following address:

PID (PP-PT) (UF0)
ATTN: CAPTAIN AFS, OHIO 45433

On October 22, 1968 I sent a letter to the same address to remind them of the fact that they have my photo. I have not received a letter from them yet.

Please conduct an investigation and let me know as soon as you find out anything.

I hope I do not have to write to someone higher than yourselves.

Yours truly,
