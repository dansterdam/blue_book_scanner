Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your report of aerial objects which you were unable to identify.

The objects reported are characteristic of observations of astronomical bodies:

The first object in the northeast is the star Capella; the second object at 060 degrees azimuth is the planet Jupiter; the third object rising at 060 degrees azimuth is the star Betelgeuse.

Jupiter is visible at about 9:30 PM, and Betelgeuse is visible at about 10:00 PM. The star Capella appears at 0:25 degrees azimuth at 6:00 PM, but it may not be visible until the sun sets.

Thank you for submitting your report to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

J. Quintile, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
