Transcription of the text in the document:

intrigued me the most is this change in color and then the very high rate of speed. It changed from this sort of yellowih-white color to a bright, reddish, reddish-orange color. And these aren't actual colors, I don't think, but this is my explanation of them, sort of a reddish-orange, very bright, much brighter than it had been, and at this point the beam slowly receded, and it changed colors, brightened in intensity, this is where it moved straight upward at a very high rate of speed, and my brother is in the Navy, in the Naval Air Reserve. I've been out and watched these just fly, phantom jets and all this, I've seen them hit afterburn, and they are fast, but this object moved, this light, moved much faster than anything that I have ever experienced before in my life.

When you say straight up, do really mean straight up, or at any sort of an angle?

It seemed to me to go just as straight up as it could go. And it seemed to be moving so fast that it just completely went out of possible eye-sight, in a matter of seconds. I leaned forward on the steering wheel and watched it go up--and here is something else that is rather confusing to me--when I sat back in the seat the car was creeping forward, the engine was running, the car was still in drive the radio was playing, the lights were on.

So you didn't have to start the engine again.

I do not recall restarting the engine. This is where I have the most ridicule. Now this is where people, they where up to this point they may have believed what I was telling them, when I tell them this, then they say well, you're just a crazy fool. A lot of them will walk off, but I don't.
