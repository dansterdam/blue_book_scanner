The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The page contains text and a diagram that asks the viewer to imagine a sketch of an object in the sky and describe its movement and direction.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Draw an arrow to show the direction the object was traveling. If you saw the object only once, place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The text below the diagram provides a handwritten response:
A. all very irregular course - not a general direction. B. (north-east)
They were scattered completely, but all traveling in a westerly direction.
