Racine, Wisconsin
May 26, 1962

Dear Sir:

I have just read in the local paper about another unidentified object seen in our area. I am writing to tell you about something that happened to my husband and I on May 11, 1962.

We were driving home from Milwaukee about 10:30 p.m. on that date. As we approached the [illegible] area, my husband suddenly said, "Look at that!" I looked up and saw a bright light in the sky. It seemed to be hovering over the highway, then suddenly shot straight up at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight.

We both watched it intently, and it was definitely not an airplane, meteor, or anything like that. It was a bright, white, round object that seemed to glow. It was not blinking or flashing as airplanes do. The speed at which it shot straight up was unbelievable.

I am writing to you in the hope that you will find this information of interest and that it may add to your files on unexplained aerial phenomena. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely yours,
Marion Fanzke
