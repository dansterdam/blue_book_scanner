Dear Col. O'Regan:

This is what I wrote to all concerning a U.F.O. sighting.

Wright-Patterson A.F.B. does not have any information on a U.F.O. sighting from [redacted] on [redacted]. No reports of a U.F.O. sighted have been received at this office. 

We would, of course, have a record of any such report and would be interested in obtaining any additional details you may have.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance in this matter.

Sincerely,

[redacted]
