SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 9 Jan 67

TO: TEST/EEO

1. Reference your letter, subject same as above, dated 7 Feb 67.
2. We reached the conclusion that it "was an UFO sighting and not a misidentification of this nature" because it appeared on two different radar sets, operating on different frequencies, and then was sighted visually by an experienced pilot. (We) plotted it on our Radar Control. They called for verification to the 4351st ACCS at Lockbourne AFB. Both of these organizations are in the area. The possibility of its being an unknown aircraft cannot be completely ruled out, but it is a slim possibility in view of:
a. Lack of knowledge of any traffic by either control agency.
b. Our remoteness from population necessitates more stringent flight planning rules. 
3. The speed attributed to the object by the radar observer at the 551st ACW Squadron. He followed it for 12 sweeps on an AN/FPS-93 and estimated its speed during the first eight (8) sweeps to be 200 knots. During the last four (4) sweeps its speed was 2100 knots.
