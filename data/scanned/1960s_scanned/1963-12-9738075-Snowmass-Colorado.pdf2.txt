Snowmass, Colorado
December 18, 1963

U.S. Air Force Academy
Colorado Springs, Colo.  Attn: Sgt. re: unknown aircraft

Dear Sir:

About a week ago my husband called you concerning some unknown objects that we saw in the sky. If you found anything out about these objects, we are certainly curious to know anything that you could tell us about them. There certainly was something there, moving fairly fast, standing still and then moving slowly, in the case of the one object. The other two objects didn't move as far as we could tell. One of them was in the clouds part of the time, but the other one was in plain view. We watched them at least for an hour, from sunset until it was completely dark, and there was certainly no mistaking them for a star, and through our field glasses the closest one appeared to be black and red on the end. Anyway if you can give us any information on them, we would certainly appreciate it.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

P.S. We also called one of our neighbors who lives about five miles up the road from our place and they saw several of these objects in different places also.
