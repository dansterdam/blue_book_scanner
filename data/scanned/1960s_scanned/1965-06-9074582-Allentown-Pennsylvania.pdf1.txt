11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
A TIM with a curved trajectory included, described in response to basic letter reporting other UFO sightings. Form 164 sent in response to basic letter. One additional report this date from Pennsylvania, no additional reports to date from surrounding area. No information that the object increased from several seconds to one minute. It is believed that the object was most likely a TIM (Turkey Inquiry Model) which may cost more to shoot down than to ignore since it posed no threat and was in all probability merely some object that naturally occurred.
