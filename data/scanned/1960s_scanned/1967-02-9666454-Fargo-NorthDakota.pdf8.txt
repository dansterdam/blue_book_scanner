AP [P] NRS 2 original prints (B&W) QUALITY Poor
PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 67-88, submitted by Major Ulmaniec-Czarniak, regarding photo analysis of photographs taken of a UFO in the vicinity of Fargo, North Dakota.
ANALYSIS: The "unidentified object" appears on each of the referenced photographs. On the first exposure the image appears as a white light, near circular in shape, with a star-like emanation from the base. No other details are discernible. On the second exposure the image is slightly larger and more distinct. However, there are no additional details observable. The source's estimates of size (five feet in diameter) and distance (approximately 200 feet) are considered the photographic evidence, however, as no scale or reference points are available, the exact size and distance cannot be ascertained due to the lack of necessary detail for such calculations.
