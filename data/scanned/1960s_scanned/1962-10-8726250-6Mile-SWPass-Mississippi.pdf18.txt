Satellite Radio Link
Planned for America
PROJECT RELAY, the communications
satellite which will link North America and
Europe directly for the first time, is being
prepared for launching late this year, it was
announced in Nutley, N. J.
The launching will be by National Aeronautics and Space Administration from Cape
Canaveral and the satellite will be placed in
a stationary orbit over the equator.

First Live Color
Television From Europe
TELSTAR, the communications
satellite which has broadcast the
first live television from Europe to
the U.S. and vice versa, is believed to
be the first commercial satellite to
transmit high-quality color television pictures. The picture was transmitted in color to Washington, D. C.
It was the first time the satellite
has been used for color television
transmissions.

Radiation Belt No Hazard
Geostationary Satellites

TELSTAR VI, the latest research weather
satellite aimed for use primarily in the near
future, is expected to transmit clear pictures
and collect useful radiation data without presenting a hazard from trapped radiation belt
particles, according to George Ludwig of
Princeton University.
Some space shots have been delayed by the
hazardous radiation of the Van Allen belts,
said Ludwig, an astrophysicist for the U.S.
National Satellite Weather Center.
Telstar VI, named Nimbus III, is due to
orbit at 700 miles from the earth during August, Sept., Oct. and its weak signals will be
relayed to the U.S. Weather Bureau.
During the extreme success of the research
satellite mission, some satellites have experienced occasional failures attributed to the
"higher than expected" radiation belts.
Telstar, the first "open" from the weather spy, as well
as others other communications satellites are
planned by the Communications Satellite Corp.
to be used operationally until the
1964 system becomes available
to the public.
These weather satellites equipped with
vehicles was launched at the end of August.
The electronic boxes protecting the equipment
and extending the useful life of the satellite
have withstood the Van Allen belt radiation remarkably well, it will take at least several
months before recharge of the orbiting batteres is necessary, Dr. Ludwig reported.
Telstar system has just been subject of
checks by the U.S. and its counterparts in
Europe. Technical problems have been ironed
out and the satellite will be available for its
inaugural services said Dr. Ludwig.

Instrument Packages to
Reach Venus After 1965
A new series of Venus probes will be launched
landing on the hidden surface sometime
after 1965.
The packages, specially designed, will be
dropped from a Venus orbiter, then will radio
back data during the descent and operation
on the surface.
Another Mariner fly by Venus in 1964.
A new sophisticated Mariner that can
carry an additional 300 pounds
of science gear to Mercury and
Venus on the planet's encounter course
was approved by NASA and will be
launched in 1964 or 1975.
Earlier Mariner flights in 1962 and 1973 will be
paving the way for the 1964 vehicle's more
complicated mission of detailed
study of Venus and Mercury.
