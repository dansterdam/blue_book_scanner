The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten notes and instructions.

DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROJECTIONS, AND INDICATE CLEARLY THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HOLD A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT. DRAW HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IT COVERED IN DEGREES. THIS WILL INDICATE WHAT FRACTION OF YOUR FIELD OF VIEW THE OBJECT OCCUPIED. ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF YOUR FIELD OF VIEW THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

Barely the object, but as I had met the time of the lighting of the matches.
