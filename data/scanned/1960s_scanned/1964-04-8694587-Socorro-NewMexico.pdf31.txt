The image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it appears to be a scanned page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

At least one other person called a to view the object. This was Opal Grinder, manager of a White Sands Proving Ground Service Station situated about 12 miles northeast of the station and remarked that several UFOs flew around here previously. "The tourist said what she saw was just a hopping helicopter. If that's what it was, the man said, holding on to his car. It actually was a stranger who came out of the desert and landed moments later. The tourists commented that he appeared to be searching for something. This was Zamora's car. Grinder did not know of the significance of the incident."

A woman from Tucson, Ariz. couple was a passenger to interview Zamora. The woman said a rain had occurred. She and the other persons in the car all saw the object hovering for two hours at an estimated altitude of 400 feet. It was reported the observers had seen a man on the "edge" of the object.

Capt. Richard T. Holder of Socorro, U.S. Army, Headquarters Battery, Stallion Range Center on White Sands Missile Range, said Zamora had notified him directly of the incident on the evenings of April 24 by local civilians who asked to provide assistance with a reported situation. I attempted to determine whether White Sands Missile Range Headquarters had anything that might indicate the conditions described.
