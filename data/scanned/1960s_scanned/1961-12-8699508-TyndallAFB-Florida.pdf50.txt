The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page of text from a UFO report document.

I did some research and checked all of the places where I thought they might have seen the UFO.

I told Mr. Hank Basham I would check further to see if the object was Echo. I figured out if the UFO was Echo it should return or about 17.5 hours. 21 December and 0510 hours, 22 December. After my final evaluation of the UFO, I came to the conclusion that the UFO sighted was not Echo, which I was unsure of.

b. Angle or elevation and azimuth of the object: See attached sketch. Object seemed to be traveling on an azimuth of 315 degrees.

c. Angle and azimuth of object seemed to disappear - any degrees and azimuth 25 degrees.

d. Description of flight path and maneuvers of object: It traveling as if it were on a fixed orbit and had a radiant surface around it. The height of the object was approximately 800 m and was traveling at a speed of approximately 18,000 miles per hour (basing this with my experience in observing echo and other satellites).

e. Manner in which object disappeared: Fading out; still the radiant lighting effect.

f. Length of time object was visible: I observed it for 15 and figured it first appeared at 0540 hours.

3. Method used in observation:
a. Ground - Visual
b. Optical aid - None
c. Aircraft used - None

4. Time and Date of Sighting:
a. Time: 0545 hours, date 21 December 1961.
