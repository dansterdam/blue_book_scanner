PROJECT 10073 RECORD
9 May 1966 10/03352
Spring Branch, Texas (1 Witness)
Possible (AIRCRAFT)
The brief summary and analysis indicate that a witness observed a long red top and white tail, blinking red light object. The observer stated at first he thought it was a regular aircraft, but then noticed it come straight down at an angle before starting back up at a normal speed. Investigation reveals that the object sighted by the observer was in all probability an aircraft landing approach detected at a distance. The pilot stated he was on a direct flight from Houston and the observation was possible due to the miscalculation of the base leg. This was substantiated by the pilot's location and heading, indicating he was in the process of landing approach.
