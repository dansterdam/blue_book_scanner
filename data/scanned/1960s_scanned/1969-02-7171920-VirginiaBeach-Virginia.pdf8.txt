Dear Sir:

I would like to report a sighting of a UFO on Feb. 5, 1969 - views from my home window.

First observation: Around 7:30 p.m. sudden appearance of a bright light in southwest sky, much brighter than any star or planet, and seemed almost as bright as a small aircraft landing light. Moved slowly at first, then increased speed and disappeared to the West.

Second observation: Around 8:30 p.m. same bright light reappeared in the southwest, moved very slowly, then increased speed and disappeared to the West.

Apparent physical aspect: Much larger than any star or planet, brighter than anything in the sky. Moved with purpose, not like a star or planet.

Duration of sightings: First - around 30 seconds. Second - around 60 seconds.

Conditions: Clear sky, stars and planets visible. Exact time correct, as checked with atomic clock in living room, correct within 10:00 p.m.

Additional info: No sound from object, no trail or exhaust, no other craft in area. I have reported this to the people you requested.
