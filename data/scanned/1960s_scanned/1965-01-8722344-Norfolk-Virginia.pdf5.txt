The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

1. No physical evidence was reported to exist.
2. The object was prompted to report his sighting after the local radio station announced the Tuskegee River Naval Air Station radar tracking an unknown object on 29 December. The bulletin stated that the station was tracking an unidentified object and had observed it for about 30 minutes. This information was passed to the project by Major Quintanilla, USAF, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.
