"On 9 Sepumber 1960 at 9:15 PM, an observer reported seeing a large orange object in the sky near Sweetwater. South Carolina. The object was described as 'spherical or circular' in shape and 'very bright' giving off an orange glow. It appeared to be about 'the size of a car' and was observed for about one minute before it disappeared behind some trees.

Observer estimated the object to be at an altitude of about 1500 feet and the estimated distance from the observer was about 1 mile. The object moved in a southerly direction at a slow rate of speed and was visible for approximately one minute before disappearing from view behind some trees.

The observer had no explanation for what was observed and stated that it was unlike any aircraft he had ever seen before. The report was investigated and the investigator could find no evidence to indicate that this was anything other than an unidentified flying object."
