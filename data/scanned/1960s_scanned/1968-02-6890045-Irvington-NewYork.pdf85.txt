UFO SIGHTED IN BREVARD

Saucer or Star, Air Force Tracks It

What glows, moves silently
through the atmosphere and
keeps the Air Force busy?

For lack of a better name, the military calls them Unidentified
Flying Objects, better known as
UFOs.

Howard Woodall, 420 Monroe
St., in Cape Canaveral, doesn't
believe in flying saucers but he
saw something he didn't understand Sunday.

Monday, the Air Force was
trying to figure out what it was.

Woodall, like hundreds of
other Brevardians on other occassions, saw a UFO while standing 
in his front yard at 8 p.m.
Sunday.

"I know it wasn't an airplane.
It looked more like a rocket," he
said Monday.

Unlike most Brevardians,
Woodall called the right people -
the Air Force.

Howard the Patrick AFB
operator who got him in touch
with the Eastern Test Range
Command Post.

For about four minutes
Woodall, his 11-year-old son and
a neighbor watched a glowing
object in the sky.

"It looked just like a rocket
blasting off at night, except it
stayed real still. It stayed real
still until it got way up," he said.

But the Air Force said there
weren't any rocket launches at
it. Sunday night.

If the UFO is explainable,
finding out what it was.
His report was passed on
Monday to the "foreign
technology" office which
investigates all UFOs. An
Force spokesman said the
will check with radars,
operators, and flight
and try to find out if there is a
reasonable explanation.

If it can be identified, the
Force will let Woodall know.

If not, the Patrick officials
said they will forward a report
Patterson AFB, Ohio, where
was the National Investigatio
Committee on Aerial
Phenomena (NICAP) at 
Pennsylvania Ave., Washington, 
will investigate.
