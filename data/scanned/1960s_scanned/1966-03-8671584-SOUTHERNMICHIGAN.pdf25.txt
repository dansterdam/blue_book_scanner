he saw nothing in the area of the sky to the northeast. This was reported to the girls but they called back at 1105 (Eastern Clock). And stated "Effective" sorry to bother you, don't want you to think we are crackpots, but the thing is coming down!" It was straight East of the dormitory and probably 3/4 miles away. He called the State Police as well as the city police who arrived shortly. investigated the area and reported there was nothing to be seen. 
Because the 4 girls continued to report lights, Van Horn decided to go to the dormitory. He was saw Mrs. Hearn the housemother at the dormitory, who took him to the second floor of the dormitory. They went to the room of Miss Jo Wilson and P. Sara Bosheckw. The girls had the room dark and windows open as they were looking down towards a swampy depression in the county side. Van Horn observed the lights then himself for the first time.
After getting his home, we proceeded to the dormitory and talked with Mrs. Hearn, who took us up to the same room, where the same girls were interviewed. They were most cooperative and Miss Boshecke, drew attached picture. (Failure #40). Both girls told me that attention was first called by a casual glance out of the window which led to a remark by one of them "therese no house down there, is there?" or words to that effect.
A fairly bright 1 red light and two yellowish lights, resembling area tree lights, according to the girls, were close to the ground in the marsh area, where, they obviously/knew there was no house.
