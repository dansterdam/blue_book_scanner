Here is the text from the document:

My report and I were at an angle of 9:35pm on August 5, 1968. I saw a bright light among the trees and moved close to investigate. I stopped the car and looked up to see a circular object about 40-50 feet across hovering silently just above the tree tops. It was glowing with a bright bluish-white light and seemed to be made of metallic material. After a minute or two, the object slowly moved off to the west and disappeared.
