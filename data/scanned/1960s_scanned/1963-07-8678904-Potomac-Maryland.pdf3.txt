November 13, 1963

Dear Dr. [redacted],

We must apologize for the delay in answering your correspondence reported sighting of July 29, 1963. Your report was submitted to our Office from the University of North Carolina, and a subsequent investigation was conducted in our continuing Atmospheric Research Program.

Investigation reveals that on July 29 at approximately 9:00 PM, at Beltsville, Maryland, two balloon packages were released. These balloons were part of an instrument package launched from Wallops Island, Virginia for atmospheric research. The Goddard Space Flight Center at Beltsville was conducting the release as part of this research program.

Two hours after the initial balloons were released, another two balloon packages were launched from Beltsville across the North Hampton, New Hampshire area. The balloons were tracking southwest towards Potomac, Maryland.

We cannot positively identify your sighting as this particular balloon release, but the description and timing suggest this was the possible cause. We are attaching two articles from the Science magazine that may provide further details on the above program. Should you desire any additional information, please contact Mr. Vince Zilly at Boulder, Colorado.

Sincerely,
MASTON M. JACKS
Public Information Division
