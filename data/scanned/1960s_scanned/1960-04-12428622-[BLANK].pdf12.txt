UFO's 1960
(A written version of the talk presented
to the Hypervelocity Impact Conference
Berlin Air Force Base, April 27, 1960)

I find it intriguing that at such a gathering as this I, an astronomer, should be asked to address you, not on the subject of satellite tracking--my work for the past four years--nor on the past four years of stellar spectroscopy--nor on the expanding universe--all topics to which I could do some manner of justice--but on Unidentified Flying Objects. Not that I am not qualified to speak on this topic. Perhaps, if I may be permitted to say so without incurring the charge of immodesty, I am uniquely qualified in all except one way to speak to you--and that exception is simply that I have never seen a UFO. But I have had as much experience, I daresay, as perhaps almost anyone with UFO's on their own plane of existence. And on that plane they are as real as rain. That plane is that of reports--for as far as any of us here are concerned--unless some of you in the audience have had personal experience--they exist for you and me simply as reports.
