The image appears to be a handwritten document, but there is no photograph present. I will now transcribe the text from the document:

"The object was visible to me for approximately 10 minutes. It was hovering and slowly moving in an erratic manner which indicated to me that it was not an airplane or any conventional aircraft. The object came closest to me at an altitude of an estimated 2000 feet. It appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a bright glow which varied in intensity from time to time. I was unable to determine the size of the object but it appeared to be quite large. When it moved, it did so in a smooth and silent manner, accelerating and decelerating rapidly. After about 10 minutes, the object suddenly disappeared from view, apparently by accelerating to a very high speed. I was quite startled by the experience and was unable to determine the nature or origin of the object."
