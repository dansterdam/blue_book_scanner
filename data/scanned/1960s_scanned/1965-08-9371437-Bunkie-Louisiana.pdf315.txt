ITEM/UFO
Request for UFO Information

TO: USAP SAPDC (Mrs. Bain)

1. We appreciate Mr. Ruppelt's interest on the subject of unidentified flying objects. The attached brochure outlines the status of this project. His book "The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects" published in 1956 and 1959 summarizes opinions stated in current cases of the author and do not reflect those of the United States Air Force. Mr. Ruppelt is presently employed in private industry and his opinion policy is to submit photographic evidence to specialists. 

2. We are interested in further analysis of the Willshire photos as of 30 August 1965. Current photo analysis by a private firm indicates more familiar with photo manipulation. An example of this is when prints for 10 July 1952 claim to show lightning on the cars beneath them. The current evaluation is that the lightning is not shown on the originals.
