Various observers around the area reported a bright round shaped object which moved slowly toward the west. According to the witnesses, the object was very thin and another witness said the object was more of a yellow color than a red. The object slowly rose from the ground or at an low altitude and traveled toward the west. One witness said that the object looked like it burnt up above the trees.
