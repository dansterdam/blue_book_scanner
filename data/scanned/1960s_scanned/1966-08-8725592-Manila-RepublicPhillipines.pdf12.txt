MAY 17 1967

Dear Captain Lagervall:

Reference your recent observation and subsequent photograph of an unidentified object:

The photography appears genuine insofar as content is concerned. The slide itself, however, contains little that can be observed to the photographic image. Examination of the color slide has negated the possibility that these images are the result of a developing or processing defect, and they appear to be an accurate representation of the object viewed within them.

Regretfully, no other information has been submitted for information on aircraft activity that could have accounted for this particular observation; however, as such, no definite identification has been made. This is your 35 mm slide. Thank you for submitting it for evaluation.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
