PART I. FOR AFCIN MAJ GEN WALSH AND FOR RDY MAJ GEN WATSON
AT 1437 H, 21 APR 61, AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WAS SIGHTED
ON RADAR IN THE VICINITY OF CAPE CANAEVERAL PRIOR TO THE
LAUNCHING OF TEST NUMBER 1352, APOLARIS MISSILE, SCHEDULED 
FOR 1439 Z. THREE EXPERIENCED OBSERVERS WATCHED THE TARGET
ON FPS-16 RADAR FOR 30 MINUTES ESTIMATED ITS SPEED AS
RANGING BETWEEN 150 AND 600 KNOTS. THESE OBSERVERS REPORTED
THAT THE OBJECT ORBITED 5 OR 7 TIMES ALONG AN AZIMUTH OF 126
DEGREES FROM CAPE CANAEVERAL AND BETWEEN 10 AND 25 MILES FROM
THE CAPE. THE RANGE OBSERVERS' ESTIMATES OF THE HEIGHT OF THE
UFO DID NOT AGREE, REPORTING EITHER THAT THE OBJECT WAS VERY LOW
OR VERY HIGH. A RANGE SURVEILLANCE C-54 WAS VECTORED TO WITHIN 
2 1/2 MILES OF THE OBJECT BUT REPORTS FROM THE CREW WERE NEGATIVE.
THE RANGE C-54 IS EQUIPPED WITH AN APS-42 AND AN APS-59 RADARS
BUT UTILIZED ONLY THE APS-42 DURING THIS ATTEMPTED INTERCEPT.
