Des 65

A third Peruvian landing, which came to our attention just before press time, occurred back in July. A newspaper clipping dating 26 Jul 65 mention of a young mother in Lima, Peru, who saw a flying object with a flashing light on a landing near her home. The witness, named Francisco Rivas, said that it looked "like a huge glowing cigar-shaped silver object hovering over the landing site." As the object landed, the woman said she "became frightened and disappeared into the house." Suddenly the machine moved to the side and took off, moving slowly at first and then at great speed, until it disappeared into the night sky.
