The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with handwritten text.

outside during the three hours everything was happening and we both saw a very sudden change in the temperature after the first sightings.
Good, it does seem quite unhill. A matter of seconds it was cold. The weather may not have been affected by the object but I should mention it just in case.
I cannot be a judge just what to say since I was an eye witness. I wish I would remember more of the details. If I do this thing else I will let you know. Meanwhile, I still suggest that you continue with your investigation. Don't know what good it will do that I don't even know me, but I will personally vouch for the honesty and reliable witness in the world.
Thank you again, Mr. Hynek. I hope this letter will help.
Sincerely,
