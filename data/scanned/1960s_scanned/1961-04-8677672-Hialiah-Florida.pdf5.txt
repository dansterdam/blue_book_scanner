Request for UFO Information (Earl Valentine)
8 July 1963
Hq USAF SAF-01 3b (Mrs. Wells)
Wash 25 DC

1. Reference the attached letter from Earl Valentine on unidentified flying objects. This letter is forwarded to your office for whatever action you deem necessary.

2. TO date, there is no evidence to support the existence of vehicles under intelligent control from outer space, remaining under observation of our stations, and capable of maneuvers that they assume the aircraft under simultaneous electronic/radar/visual observation.

3. Information concerning Mr. Earl Valentine's sighting of 28 April 1963 is very vague. It is probable that an aircraft was sighted.
