1. DATE: 26 JUL 61
2. LOCATION: MISAWA AFB, JAPAN
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2015
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: GROUND-RADAR
5. DURATION OF OBSERVATION: 2 MIN.
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2 MIN.
9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: White oval, object observed traveling east to west at high speed. Observed through scope on radar, suddenly disappeared from scope.
10. COMMENTS: It suddenly disappeared from radar scope after about 2 minutes of observation. It was traveling at a velocity estimated at approximately 1500-2000 mph. I could not determine the altitude, but it was at a high altitude. There was no aircraft or other known object in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. The motion and duration of the observation was such that it could not have been a meteor or any other natural phenomenon. A well-trained radar operator observed this object and was convinced that it was a definite solid object under intelligent control.
