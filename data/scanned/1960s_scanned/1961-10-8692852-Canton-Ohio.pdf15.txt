The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a textual description of a UFO sighting. 

The text describes a "spectacular flying saucer" that hovered near the Smithsonian satellite-observing station in Curacao, British West Indies on the night of October 27, 1958. The object was observed by the station crew and was described as a "brilliantly glowing object" that was moving erratically and fluctuating in brightness. After watching it for nearly an hour, the observers concluded that the object must be less distant than it seemed, and went out by car to get a closer look. However, when they approached the area where the object had been, the mystery was solved.

The text further mentions that a plantation manager and his servant observed the object from a field, and that a pressure lantern that was hanging from it was a "lighted pressure lantern" [14].
