"Project Blue Book Special Report
Subject: "Unidentified Flying Objects"
Dear Sir:
It has recently come to our attention that you may have observed unusual objects in the sky. We have had many reports of similar sightings and have made extensive inquiries regarding many of our observations. We are in the ninth year of this project.
Observations on 17 August 1964
It was about 1:25 AM on 17 August 1964, when two witnesses sighted a bright light which seemed to move erratically above the horizon in the northeast. The object was observed for several minutes and then disappeared below the horizon.
The witnesses describe the object as a bright light, much brighter than any stars or planets in the sky at the time. It was observed to make sudden movements, stopping, starting, and changing direction rapidly. No sound was heard from the object.
We have received a number of similar reports, and these observations seem to be of interest to answer any questions you may have about them."
