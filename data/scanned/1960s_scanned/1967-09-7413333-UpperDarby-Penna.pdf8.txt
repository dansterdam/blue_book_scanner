PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
PART II-ANALYSIS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTS RECEIVED THROUGH DECEMBER 1952

I.   BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
    A. Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 was prepared by the Directorate of Intelligence, United States Air Force. It contains an analysis of unidentified flying object (UFO) reports received through December 1952, as part of Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's program for investigating UFO sightings.
    B. The objectives of this report were to examine the available UFO data, determine the reliability of the reports, and evaluate the possible explanations for the sightings.

II. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
    A. Analysis of the 3,201 UFO reports received through December 1952 revealed that the majority could be explained as misidentifications of conventional objects or phenomena.
    B. Approximately 23% of the reports were classified as "unidentified", meaning they could not be explained with the available information.
    C. The report concluded that there was no evidence of a threat to national security from the UFO phenomenon, and that the available data did not support the existence of interplanetary vehicles.

III. RECOMMENDATIONS
    A. The report recommended that Project Blue Book continue its investigation of UFO reports, with the goal of identifying and explaining as many sightings as possible.
    B. It also suggested that the collection and analysis of UFO data be improved to better understand the phenomenon.
