There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old document, likely a UFO report, with a series of questions and answer choices.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

(Use as much space as necessary)
I saw a lighted object or objects which had a round, circular shape and appeared to be a group of brightly lighted objects, with pulsating or flashing lights. The objects appeared to move up and down and from side to side at a very rapid rate of speed. The objects did not appear to have any distinguishing features other than lights. The objects did not appear to have any wings or other obvious structural features. The objects appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed but did not appear to make any sound.
