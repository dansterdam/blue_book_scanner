REPORT: CADO 55-2 (Major Coleman) 
WABASHING-TON, D.C.

SYNOPSIS: 

A UFO was sighted by several observers over Nashville, Tennessee, 20 May 1961. It was reported that a balloon was at high altitude northeast of Nashville. The balloon was on a slow drift northward. When the sun was far enough below the horizon, the object began to glow, making a rapid climb and then disappearing. The object and flight pattern appeared to be a balloon.

The report states the object was observed by rocket range-radio crew of Sewart AFB, Tennessee. This activity is substantiated by radio messages from the ground console (and eye witness testimony) describing illuminated flight patterns consistent with a balloon.
