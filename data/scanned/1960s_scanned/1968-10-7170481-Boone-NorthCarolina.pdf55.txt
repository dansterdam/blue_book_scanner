The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

USAF REPORT - SERIAL NUMBER 569975671
a. 3 years - U.S. Army Intelligence
b. 2 years - U.S. Army CID
d. 13 years - USAF - Linguist, primarily in USAPE
e. 9 years - British Intelligence Agent prior to U.S. military service
f. Speaks 7 languages
1. Reliability of this report is extremely questionable, because it was generated by a Lt. Stricksen on 20 November 1968 and is being held for investigation on a charge of attempting to destroy a Confidential file, which he was alleged to be currently investigating.
