MEMO FOR THE RECORD 23 August 1963

Sub: Photographs taken by Mr. ********, President of the Metro-Market Advertising Agency called
Lt Colonel Quintanilla on 23 August 1963 regarding some photographs of
unidentified flying objects that he accidentally took. Mr. ******* informed
Col Quintanilla that he had spoken with Lt Conway at Suffolk County AFB
with regards to the photographs. Mr. ******* said that he and his other
professional members had never seen anything quite like this, they are
quite extraordinary. Mr. ******* said he had never been interested in UFOs.
He said he had some of his top people study the photographs and knew it
wasn't reflections, lens flares, inversions or birds. He said the objects
are reflecting off of the sun, they have structural shapes. He blew them up
to it in diameter with a projection screen. There is a good deal of details,
with indentations, they have domes. Mr. ******* said that since he thought
there was no one more familiar with photographs than the Air Force than the
Blue Book Office, he wanted to forward them to Wright-Patterson for analysis.
Col Quintanilla informed Mr. ******* that he would turn them over to his photo
analysis personnel. Mr. ******* said he was sending them to Suffolk, Lt Conway
and Lt Conway was going to send them to Wright-Patterson. Lt Conway had
asked him some questions over the telephone but they weren't very detailed.
At the time the photographs were taken they were crossing the Delaware River
Bridge to New York, with a night camera he was taking pictures at 1/500 a
second. Mr. ******* stated to be assured that he would not the the full results
of the analysis if he turned them over to the Air Force. Col Quintanilla
informed him that he would receive the full report. He said that the company
attorney thought he shouldn't send the original negatives into the Air Force
but with Col Quintanilla's assurance that the original transparencies would
be returned in the same condition that he forwarded them to the Air
Force.
