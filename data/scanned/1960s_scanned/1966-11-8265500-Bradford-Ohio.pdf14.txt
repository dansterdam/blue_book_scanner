The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: _____________

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what: _____________

17. Tell in a few words, the following things about the object:
a. Sound _______________________________
b. Color _at least a slight orange at times, and slightly elliptical_
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and estimate the size of the object. If you had performed this experiment, how big of an object would have been disclosed? _I would guess about 3 to 5 would fit in the match stick field_

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you see, such as wings, lights, or especially and/or vapor trails. Please an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

(A simple sketch is present, consisting of a single dot with an arrow pointing to the right.)
