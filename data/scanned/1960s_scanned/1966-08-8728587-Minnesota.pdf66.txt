Dear Sirs:

Enclosed are photographs taken by myself on August 6, 1966 at approximately 11:20 P.M. at my home in [location redacted], Minnesota. I was outside looking up at the sky when I observed an object in the sky that appeared to be hovering. I quickly grabbed my camera and took several photographs of the object before it suddenly disappeared.

I am enclosing the best of the photographs taken that evening. I hope these are of some value to your investigation. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,
[Sender's name redacted]
