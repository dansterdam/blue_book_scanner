The image contains a sketch and a compass rose, but no photograph. The text in the image is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "P" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "G" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "D" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
