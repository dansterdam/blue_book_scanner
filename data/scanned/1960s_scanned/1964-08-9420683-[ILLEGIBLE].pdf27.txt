Dear Mr. -

This is in response to your recent letter to the President concerning information on several recent satellite observations. The President has asked that I reply to your letter.

You indicated a date of July 3,. 1963, as the date of your first sighting. The Air Force does not record of associate passage for more than one Eeho I or Echo II for that date. However, our records for July 3, 1964 do not indicate a passage of either Echo I or Echo II for that date. It may be that you observed a satellite or laser missile, or perhaps a high-flying aircraft on that date. We did not locate any definite report with the information you provided, and we are unable to make a firm determination of the nature of the light.

Both Echo I and Echo II made several passes over your area on the succeeding evenings of August 4th and August 17th, between 7:54 P.M. and 10:45 P.M. Because of atmospheric conditions, a satellite can give the appearance of blinking or flashing as it passes overhead in much the same way that a star twinkle.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.
