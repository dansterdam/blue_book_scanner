The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with handwritten notes.

Did the phenomenon:
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?

The handwritten text provides additional details about the observed UFO phenomenon. The final question asks "A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?", but no further details are provided in the handwritten response.
