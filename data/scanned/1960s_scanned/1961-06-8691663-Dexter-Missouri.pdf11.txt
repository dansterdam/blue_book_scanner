Sergeant S. Air Force
Springfield, Missouri  
Dear Sirs:
On 17 Oct 63, at approx 3:15 AM, was awakened by a bright light outside my window. Looked out and saw a round, brilliantly illuminated object hovering approx 50 yds from my house. It was about 20-25 ft in diameter and was approx 10 ft above the ground. The object appeared to be a light metallic color and was simply hovering, making no noise. I observed it for approx 2-3 minutes, then it suddenly shot straight up out of sight in a couple of seconds. There was no smoke, flame, or exhaust visible. My radio was operating normally during this period, and my family did not have any disturbances in their sleep. I cannot offer any rational explanation for what I observed. It was definitely not any conventional aircraft or object known to me. I hope this report is of some value to your investigation. Please let me know if you require any further information.
Sincerely,
[redacted]
