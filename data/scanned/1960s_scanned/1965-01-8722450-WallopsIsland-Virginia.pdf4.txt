UFO Observation: 3 Jan 65
31 Mar 65
NASA STATION 
WALLOPS ISLAND, VIRGINIA
Dear Sir,

There are certain conditions in information regarding your reported observation of an unidentified flying object over Wallops Island on 3 January 1965 which I should like to discuss with you further.
The object described by the witness at the missile launch had a relation to the flight of the missile. However, we feel that the witness may have misinterpreted the object due to existing conditions of the launch and the flight of the missile. This does not necessarily mean that the witness did not observe an object, but it may have been another aerial phenomena unrelated to the missile.

This office would be glad to discuss with you in detail the observation you made so that we may be able to determine more accurately what you observed. If you are willing, please let me know and we will arrange a convenient time for such a discussion.

Sincerely,

MAJOR QUINTANILLA, JR
CHIEF, AERIAL PHENOMENA BRANCH
