Dear Major Quintanilla:

The enclosed newspaper article will give you information on the reported unidentified objects observed over the Planetarium (Oklahoma Science & Arts Foundation, Inc.). I have talked with Dale and have a tape interview with him about his observations of the main part.

Let me know as soon as possible what the elements are identified as. The Planetarium was also interested in a copy of the analysis.

Sincerely yours,
(Signed)
GORDON C. REVES,
Associate Director
