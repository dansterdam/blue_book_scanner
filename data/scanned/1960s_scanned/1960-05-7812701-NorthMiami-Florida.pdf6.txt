UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: North Miami, Florida
Date: 27 May 1960
Time (Z): 2235
Wx: Clear and bright
Description: A very bright light, much brighter than the surrounding stars, was seen to appear to move up and down a few inches, was changing colors of greenish silver & reddish-orange x yellow (depending on observer). The light appeared to be at a very high altitude, but between the stars and observer.
Direction of Motion: Varied
Satellite: (ARGON-JP3) phon# 69219) Ruled out
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): Probably Jupiter
Radar Analysis (ARGIN-4E1): None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): ------
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Ruled out
Other: 
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Prob reliable
Analysis and Conclusions: The location of the witnesses was apparently at Keystone Point, therefore the object must have been ESE of their location. In that part of the sky at that time, there were fixed stars apparently present which could reasonably appear to move slightly and change color. The movement reported was probably due to atmospheric conditions.
