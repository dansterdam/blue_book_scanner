October 17, 1957

Dear Mr. Sheerc,

I was most gratifying to get your letter yesterday, and to know that you had found out what you had really seen.

Now that you have identified your UFO, and are sending the questionnaire to Wright-Patterson AFB, we will let them know you are not going to send it.

And incidentally, we do not think you are a silly idiot; just the only people who do not make mistakes are those who lack intelligence and the ability to observe the world around them. It takes a really big person to admit that he has made a mistake.

Thank you for letting us know what you saw.

Sincerely,

Civil Branch
Community Relations Div.
