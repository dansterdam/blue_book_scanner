Captain G. Nilsen, Whiil reports the following:
At 2118 G.M.T. July 29, 1962, in Lat. 31 06 N., Long. 32 18 E., something that looked like a satellite or a bright star was observed in the vicinity of Regulus in bearing 235.
The satellite-like object traveled in a forward direction toward Vega and down to the horizon.
The object was visible about 7 minutes. Weather clear. Wind N.W.-force 3, barometer 1006 mb, air temperature +26 Celsius.
I am also interested to know what this could have been. With thanks for further information regarding this phenomenon.
