DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVED OBJECT:
A BRIGHT RED-ORANGE LIGHT WAS OBSERVED IN THE SKY WITH FLASHING BLUE AND RED LIGHTS AROUND THE EDGE. IT APPEARED TO BE OVAL SHAPED AND WAS HOVERING. THE OBJECT SUDDENLY STARTED TO MOVE FAST AND THEN DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.
COMMENTS: 
THIS APPEARS TO BE A SIGHTING OF A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, POSSIBLY A MILITARY AIRCRAFT, WHICH WAS ENGAGING IN NIGHT MANEUVERS. THE FLASHING LIGHTS AND HOVERING ATTITUDE ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF SUCH AIRCRAFT. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE DESCRIPTION TO SUGGEST THAT THIS WAS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
