The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text in the document appears to be a report or letter regarding some kind of unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document, without any additional commentary:

Dear Sirs,

On Oct. 2, 1967, at approximately 10:00 p.m. I was standing in the parking lot of the Holiday Inn in Oelwein, Iowa and observed a strange object in the sky. It appeared to be hovering and suddenly shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object had red and blue lights and was approximately 200 to 300 feet in diameter. There were no other witnesses that I am aware of. Could you please investigate this matter further and let me know if you have any additional information on similar sightings in this area. 

Thank you for your prompt attention.

Sincerely,
