The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically a report titled "Moorland sighting" that describes a sighting that occurred on July 25th.

Moorland sighting  
This letter was printed in the British Plane Spotter on Sept. 12, 1963. Returning from holiday about 1 a.m. on Tuesday, July 7th, 1964, my wife and I were driving along Moorland Drive, Vespasian Park, Uding-bornc (near Bournemouth), Dorset. As we approached a point about 1/2 mile from our home, we thought it was a plane at first but as it drew nearer we knew it was not a plane. It was a "glowing" object with lights that seemed to shine from within. It had about four on the body. The whole thing took place on the minute. Between the time it first appeared and the time it had gone it could not have been more than about 3 minutes. I am now convinced that what we saw was a flying saucer.
