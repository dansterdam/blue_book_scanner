The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line to demonstrate how high an object was above the horizon when you first saw it, and a straight line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. The second sketch shows two different perspectives of the same scene - one labeled "A" and the other labeled "B" - to illustrate how the object's position changed.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
