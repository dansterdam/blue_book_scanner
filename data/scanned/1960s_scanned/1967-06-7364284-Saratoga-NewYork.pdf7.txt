The image does not contain any photographs. It is a page of text from a Project Blue Book document.

The included prints are of the same negative, but at different exposures to bring out the greatest detail possible. You will note that what we described as lights against the night sky appear as just the opposite - we can offer no reason for this. It is clear this effect was caused by the UFO as stated in the photo appears as it should have. As of now we do not know if the other camera recorded the same phenomenon. When this information is available, we will forward it on request.
