Dear Mr. [Redacted],

I acknowledge your recent letter requesting information on a UFO sighting you reported in 1961.

The object you saw was near the moon and was determined to be a "scintillation of GAMMA VIRGO's nearest star.".

Since it appears you are interested in astronomy and science, I recommend you read the new book "INTRODUCTION TO ASTRONOMY" by Dr. McLaughlin. Also, "WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS" will be of interest in the next few months.

Other information which might interest you is enclosed.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM J. LOOCKWOOD
