Dear sir, 
On an about the night of June 12, 1969, I was out in my yard between approximately 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. when I noticed a very bright light in the northern part of the sky. The light was quite brilliant and seemed to be closer, larger and more clear than the stars in the sky. The object was oval shaped and appeared to be moving rapidly from west to east. I called my neighbor and several other neighbors also witnessed the object. We watched it for approximately 2 to 3 minutes as it moved across the sky. The object appeared to be glowing with a greenish blue color. It did not have any visible wings, tail or exhaust and made no sound. After a brief interval of being obscured by some trees, the object then appeared to suddenly accelerate and disappear from view. I have excellent eye sight and am an amateur astronomer myself. This object was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. I feel certain that what I and my neighbors saw was a UFO, and I would appreciate any information you may be able to provide regarding this incident.
Sincerely,
