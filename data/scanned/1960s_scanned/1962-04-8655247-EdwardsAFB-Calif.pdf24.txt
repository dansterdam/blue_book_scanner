General Schriever To Keynote
Guidance Test Symposium

General B. A. Schriever, AFSC com-
mander, will be the keynote speaker for
the Guidance Test Symposium, OCT
13-14, at Patrick AFB, Florida. Sub-
jects to be covered will include design,
development, and test of guided mis-
sile guidance systems.

Pilots 'Self-Checking' Centers
Ground Control Centers will soon be-

come known as "Pilots' Self-Checking
Centers." As defined by the new USAF
Test Policy, the new centers will con-
centrate on faster turnaround of mission
aircraft and establishment of a precision
scheduling of flights to maximize use of
range instrumentation and standardiza-
tion efforts in missile and aircraft test
operations.

Face-Lifting To Add
Radar Tracking Power

The Air Proving Ground Center will
undergo the installation of a new radar
tracking system. The new radar, which
was recently announced by the APSC.
will provide precise trajectory measure-
ment of guided missiles and aircraft
during flight test operations. Radar will
have full range following an electronic
tracking link with the high-speed mis-
sile. Four high-gain parabolic reflector
antennas will track the missile on one
megawatt can at each of the four
quadrants of the system.
To the men who operate the
Radar:
"If you have difficulty making earth
contact from shift to shift, turn the
antennae toward the sun. It's there!"

First Termers
There are still airmen on their first
tour of duty who have not completed
their high school education. It is in
the Air Force's interest to see that
these airmen receive the opportunity
for high school completion.
