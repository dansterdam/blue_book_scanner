6. Soviet Attitude Toward Science Fiction

The idea of inhabited worlds naturally evokes in people all sorts of emotions which are not always amenable to scientific treatment. In the Soviet philosophy, scientific fiction occupies an honorable place provided that it is not represented as solid achievements of science. Much of what Tsiolkovskiy wrote, for instance, can be characterized as science fiction, and one of the famous Soviet writers, Alexis Tolstoy was famous for his fantastic stories. Academician Obruchev, the explorer of Siberia, was also a science fiction writer. 

However, the Soviets have attempted to draw a line separating science fiction from deliberate fraud and distortion of facts well established by science, and some Soviet scientists, principally astronomers, are busy refuting and criticizing sensationalism by writers who exhibit more exuberance than knowledge. One such writer is Kazantsev, the author of a fantastic story.
