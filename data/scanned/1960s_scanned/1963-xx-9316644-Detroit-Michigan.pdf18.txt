ASTRONOMY

Mars Becomes Prominent

The red planet Mars shines in the east in the January evening sky, and the year's best display of stars is in view in the great constellation of Orion, high overhead.

THE RED PLANET Mars is now on the view of the evening sky for the first magnitude, while Castor, above, is the second in brightness. Below to the east (at about ten o'clock on the evening of January 29) is the bright star Rigel, a blue-white star of the first magnitude, which is part of the subgroup called the Orion group.

Mars is on the evening sky, and very low on the west-northwest horizon during the last part of the period is the planet Venus, although very low in the western sky and only visible for a short time after sunset.

The astronomical program for 1963 calls for an eclipse of the moon on January 16th. This eclipse will be visible over most of North America and all of South America.

The first, on the night of Wednesday, January 2nd, is a penumbral eclipse of the moon. A penumbral eclipse involves the moon's passing through the outer fringe of the earth's shadow. Only a slight dimming of the moon's brightness is visible during this type of eclipse.

Any lunar eclipse involves the moon's passing into the earth's shadow. Around this is the penumbra, or the partial outer shadow of the earth. The full eclipse is when the moon passes into the very dark umbra, or central core of the earth's shadow.

So there are three possibilities for an eclipse: A total eclipse, a partial eclipse, and a penumbral eclipse. It may only partly enter one of these shadow areas.

January's Second Eclipse

January's second eclipse comes on the 25th, and this time it is of the sun, for the moon passes between the earth and the sun. This is an annular eclipse, not a total eclipse. Even at maximum, a rim of sunlight around the moon's edge will be visible. The sun will appear as a bright ring, or annulus, around the moon. This is called an annular eclipse.

In this type of eclipse, the moon does not completely cover the sun. The moon appears smaller than the sun, and a bright ring of sunlight appears around the edge of the moon. This is visible from a localized area on the earth's surface.

The path of the annular eclipse will cross North America, from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic ocean. The maximum eclipse will occur at about 12 noon on the 25th, Eastern Standard Time. The track of the eclipse will be visible from California to Maine, and from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.

The following points tell what this eclipse will be like:

1. It is an annular eclipse, not a total eclipse.
2. Only a bright ring of the sun's edge will be visible around the moon's disk.
3. The maximum eclipse will occur at about 12 noon, Eastern Standard Time.
4. It will be visible from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic ocean, and from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.
