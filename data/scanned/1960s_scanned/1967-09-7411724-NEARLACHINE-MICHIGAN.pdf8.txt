The image does not contain a photograph, but instead appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? NO

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes (x)  No ( ) Don't Know ( )  IF you answered YES, then tell where it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): No (x) Yes ( ) Don't Know ( )  IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of: WHEN THE OBJECT STOPPED AT ITS CLOSEST POINT, IT WAS ROCKING FROM VERY THE STARS BEHIND IT

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound NONE
b. Color OFF GRAY METALLIC COLOR

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
