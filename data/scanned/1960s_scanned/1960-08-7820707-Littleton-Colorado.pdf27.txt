Invert'r *5 in California

An unusually complex combination of events produced an epidemic of UFO Sightings in northern California during the weekend of August 1-2, 1960. Nearly 20 night flights (from dusk to dawn) through numerous localities from Thunder County and the Mount Shasta region (about 180 miles north of San Francisco) reported UFOs at various times and of various descriptions: round, bright, metallic UFOs glowing a reddish-purple fluorescent type of light, cigar-shaped UFOs trailing a long fiery exhaust, oval UFOs with red lights at each end and white lights showing at the window. Radar-equipped UFOs like a flying railroad car with flashing red lights at each end and white lights showing at the window and radar scopes were reportedly plagued with phantoms, as the state was apparently invaded by a whole fleet of patrolling saucers. The important factor in these sightings was the weather; prolonged and extensive temperature inversions prevailed in the area all that week. From southern Oregon through northern California.
