The image does not contain any photographs. The image shows a diagram illustrating the "Cruising Altitudes - Flight Levels" for aircraft operating within the United States, including the Aleutian Islands and the United States possessions and territorial claims. The diagram provides information on the various flight levels and the corresponding altitudes for even and odd thousands of feet, as well as the instrument flight rules (IFR) flight levels for different altitude ranges.

CRUISING ALTITUDES - FLIGHT LEVELS
The following procedures apply to the operation of aircraft within the United States, including the Aleutian Islands and the United States possessions and territorial claims.
ALTIMETER SETTING
(a) At and below 29,000 feet MSL, the correct altimeter setting reported by a station which is within 100 nautical miles shall be used. This altimeter setting should be the most recent, or the one at least 30 minutes old, whichever is available.
(b) Above 29,000 feet, a standard setting of 29.92 "Hg Vertical displacement of an aircraft shall be determined by reference to an altimeter which is set to 29.92 "Hg.
DIRECTION OF FLIGHT
(a) Magnetic courses or directions to be flown, and Cruising Altitudes or Flight Levels, whichever is appropriate, shall be observed in accordance with the magnetic course being flown.
(b) Cruising Altitudes shall be:
below 29,000 feet
EVEN Thousands plus 500 feet (3,500, 5,500, etc.)
ODD Thousands plus 500 feet (4,500, 6,500, etc.)
Above 29,000 feet
400 foot intervals beginning at FL 310 (FL 310, FL 330, etc.)
(c) Under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR):
EVEN Thousands (2,000, 4,000, etc.) for Eastbound aircraft
ODD Thousands (1,000, 3,000, etc.) for Westbound aircraft
At and above 29,000 feet
400 foot intervals beginning at FL 310 (FL 310, FL 330, etc.)
