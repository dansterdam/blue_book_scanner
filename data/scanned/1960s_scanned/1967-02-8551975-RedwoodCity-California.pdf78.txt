Proposed reply to letter of 11 February 1967
Dear -----,
We have your recent letter reporting your unusual observations to the Air Force. A detailed investigation did not reveal a positive identification; however, our analysts were able to uncover a possible explanation. The description you provided is very consistent with that normally reported for an observation of a hot air balloon. The Air Force has been plagued lately with reports from all persons of all ages having been releasing these balloons which are made from dry cleaning bags with candles situated on a platform of some type. As previously mentioned, a positive identification was not made but we feel that you more than likely observed one of these balloons.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
