19. WHAT WAS THE SIZE ESTIMATE OF THE OBJECT?
The object, very small and very high, reflected the sun at times, appeared to be solid, and very shiny metal. When the sun reflected off it surface it looked as if it were long and thin (cigar shaped). Comparable to a dirigible which is very high and very far away. The object remained stationary for several minutes at times. Because it was stationary and yet alternately went from bright to dull, it gave the impression it was rotating very slowly. At no time was the object seen to make a sudden or quick movement.
