The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass rose with the eight main compass directions labeled (NNW, NW, WNW, W, WSW, SW, SSW, S, SSE, SE, ESE, E, ENE, NE, NNE). The second sketch shows two landscape scenes, one larger scene with hills or mountains in the background, and a smaller inset scene with a person standing and looking out towards a landscape.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A '+' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A '+' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE DIRECTION OF FLIGHT. INDICATE WHETHER THE PATH APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS SKECTH.
