Statements:
States were several bright objects ascending and descending at the same time - at high speed. He figured there were about a dozen or more. They would go up and down, hover, then shoot off in one direction and then another - never traveling in a straight line. They made no sound - were not blinking lights of any sort and appeared to be round in shape. Suddenly, some would simply disappear from sight. At times, they would be stationary for a few seconds, then dart off again at terrific speed. At the same time, another group of about the same number would appear in a different part of the sky and repeat the same maneuvers. He watched them for over an hour - they were visible all during this time and he had his wife and children also watching them. He is certain of what he saw and is a reliable and rational person.
