UFO REPORT - MR. R.P. CAMBRI DGS, MESA, ARIZONA
DATE OF OBSERVATION: OCTOBER 19, 1957
FROM: NICAP CASE SECTION
TO: NICAP, WASHINGTON, D.C.

The attached report of a UFO sighting near Beach Island, Georgia, was sent to us from an anonymous source at Virginia. The sighting occurred on October 19, 1957. The report states that the sighting was made at Wallops Island, Virginia. During the cloud movements, a cylindrical object was observed to emerge from the cloud formation and to ascend vertically at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 7-8 minutes.

The sender of the report checked with the "sky-lite" advertising plane company and revealed that his aircraft was not in the area. Under certain conditions, the report indicates that erroneous conclusions regarding the nature of UFOs are sometimes reached, although conventional explanations may not always be satisfactory. The witnesses are well-known by Mr. Gold.

Respectfully,
NICAP CASE SECTION
