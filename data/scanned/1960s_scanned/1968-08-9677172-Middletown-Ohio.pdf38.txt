UPO Observation, 19 Aug 69

1. Reference your undated letter reporting a sighting of a metallic shining object on 15 Aug 69. From the time and place you have described, this could have been one of the visible satellite tracks passing in the night sky. Many of the reports we receive are of illuminated satellite tracks rather than it must have been one of the visible retro-grade satellites. However, continue to report such manifestations to us at once, especially if you should see an exact identification would be extremely difficult.

2. The disturbing implication in your letter leads me to suspect you think this or other aerial phenomena you may have observed are possibly products of an unknown advanced technology. While this CANNOT be ruled out on the basis of the UPO observation alone, we are unable to further investigate your sightings. However, we will include your report for information purposes with our concerns.
