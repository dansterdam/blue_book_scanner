TO GENERAL HOLOMAN
INFORMAL SUMMARY AND OUTLINE OF WHAT, IN MY OPINION, THE FUTURE
OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH FROM HIGH ATMOSPHERIC ALTITUDES HOLDS.
I SHOULD ALSO LIKE TO COMMENT WITH PLEASURE ON THE ENTHUSIASM AND SKILL OF CAPTAIN RITTINGER. I CONSIDER MYSELF EXTREMELY FORTUNATE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH CAPTAIN RITTINGER.
I HAVE NO SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO OUR PROJECT, BUT DO EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT AS IT CONTINUES TO DEVELOP IT WILL RECEIVE THE PERSONAL GOOD WISHES AND SUPPORT, I AM, HOWEVER, HAVE SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE AIR FORCE.
FOR MORE THAN A DECADE I HAVE BEEN CONSULTANT TO THE AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER REGARDING THE PROBLEM OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, PARTICULARLY THEIR ASTRONOMICAL ASPECTS.
I BEL THAT YOU WELL KNOW THE AIR FORCE HAS ATTEMPTED TO DO AS CREDIBLE A JOB AS POSSIBLE IN MAKING THE RESULTS OF THEIR STUDY PUBLICLY KNOWN. HOWEVER, ALL TOO OFTEN SUCH PUBLIC OPINION HAS BEEN UNFAVORABLE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE REFUSAL TO GIVE THE EVIDENCES OF THE REALITY OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS TOO MUCH PUBLICITY, THE AIR FORCE IS COVERING UP THE EVIDENCE AND MISLEADING THE PUBLIC. I THINK THE EVIDENCES SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE.
SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO ASK FOR MY SUGGESTIONS, I WOULD, THEREFORE, RECOMMEND THAT THE SCIENTIFIC ASPECTS OF THE UFO PROBLEM BE TRANSFERRED FROM ATIC TO A DIVISION MORE DIRECTLY CONCERNED WITH SUCH MATTERS, PERHAPS TO THE ASTROPHYSICS RESEARCH DIRECTORATE.
