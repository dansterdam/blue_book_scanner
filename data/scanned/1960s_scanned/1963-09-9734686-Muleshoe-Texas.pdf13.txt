"AF IN 21939 (4 OCT 63) PASS FOUR RUSSIAN SA UNUSUAL R-S WERE OBSERVING THE SAME PHENOMENON. THAT THEY UFO WAS JUDGED TO BE ANYWHERE FROM 100 YARDS TO 55 MILES AWAY MAY HAVE BEEN ANY VISUAL RESPONSE DUE TO CONSIDER TO DISTANCE AS WELL AS THE TENDENCY OF THE UNTRAINED EYE TO DISBELIE OBJECT WHICH IS CLEARLY IN VIEW COULD POSSIBLE BE MORE VALUABLE OR HALLOS WHICH MAY HAVE SUCH OBSERVED. INDIVIDUALS WHO DID OCCUR THE SIGHTING AS AN ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENON OCCURING MANY HILLS WERE ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH SCIENTIFIC AND FLYING BACKGROUND EXPERIENCED IN OBSERVING UNUSUAL OVER GREAT DISTANCES A MEXICAN FARM WORKER BELIEVED TO BE AN AIRCRAFT CRASHING 5 MILES AWAY WAS MOST PROBABLY LARGE METEOR DISAPPEARING IN A CURVE OF THE EARTH MANY DISTANCE AWAY. THE INDICATOR OF THE GREAT DISTANCE INVOLVED WAS THE FACT THAT NO OBSERVERS HEARD ANY SOUND. IF AN AIRPLANE EXPLODED AND 55 MILES AWAY, OR AN OBJECT EXPLODED OVER A 2.5 MILE AWAY, THERE WOULD HAVE SURELY BEEN A SOUND".
