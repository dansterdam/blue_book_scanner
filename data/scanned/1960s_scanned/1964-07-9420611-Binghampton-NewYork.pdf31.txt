Glowing UFO Seen
By Norwich Man

A Norwich man engineered an object hovering in the air and watched it for about five minutes, according to a report received at state police headquarters.
The man, who was not identified, said he stopped and watched the object, which appeared to be about 25 feet in diameter, as it hovered over his daughter's camp where she was staying as a counselor. 
When he saw the object, he said he stopped and watched it for about five minutes. He estimated the object to be 25 feet in diameter and said it shined with an iridescent slow around the outer edge like a fluorescent light.
Then there were three flashes of light which "practically blinded me" when the object left.
The UFO was reported by the man in a call to state police at Sidney.
