"Waynetice, Colo 8/8/62

subject: Sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena
Washington, D.C.

About midnight tonight during my regular check, I noticed something rather unusual in the sky. This was a bright light, the size of a large silver ball. The light was stationary for about a minute and then moved swiftly off to the southwest where it was lost to sight. There was no sound audible and the light was very bright, almost blinding. The light appeared to be about 25 miles distant and very high in the sky. Another and smaller light soon appeared, this one was stationary for only a few seconds and then disappeared. It was reported that there were similar sightings in this area which convinced me that it was not a meteor or satellite."
