1. On or about 5 October 1960 at 2100 hours, T/Sgt ******, 3330 Air Base Wing, Mitchell Air Force Base, New York, with a ****** as chauffeur for Lt. General William B. Hall, Commander, CONARC, sighted an unidentified flying object.

2. The sergeant and his son were fishing on the beach at Point Lookout, Long Island, New York (located 4 miles east of Long Beach), when they sighted a bright object appear high in the sky moving from northeast to southwest. On first sighting, the object appeared to be going straight towards them, which was the Hill, then it made a very wide turn to the right and into a northeasterly direction. During this turn, the object appeared almost stationary, and a vapor trail could be seen. During this time the object resembled a large star, as it passed over Point Lookout, it turned to the southeast and then made a wide sweeping turn to the right and westerly, passing back towards the moon in a northeasterly direction. During the turn, the object appeared only as a blurry, very faint nebulous star with no indications of a tail or vapor trail being present. The turn was wide, extending almost to the southeast and western horizons before going again towards the northeast.

3. The observer said the object appeared to be very high and moving faster than any aircraft he had ever seen. There was no noise. The object was visible only as a continuous white light.

4. The only other known observer was Sgt ****, the young son who was with him at the time of the sighting.
