STATEMENT

Friday, 26 August 1966 my wife, three children and I were traveling from Ft Payne, Georgia to Gaylesville, Alabama. Our trip began on US Highway 11 and then became Highway 35. Four miles past the State line we intersected Highway 35 at approximately 9:55 pm. EDT. The sky was clear and the objects, which my wife noticed were then at our upper right (Gaylesville direction). She said her attention rested on them because they appeared a little larger than usual and seemed to be moving relative to each other. She said nothing to me at this time.

It was then that I looked up (about 11 o'clock) directly in front of the car. I was normal to the road. The objects had made a semi-circular passing movement and seemed to be at equilibrium in the center of the triangle and moved relative to each other through rapid progressions and rotations, once configuring themselves in the air direction.

The objects passed directly overhead normal to the highway and off into the distance.

There was no noticeable wind on the ground, the temperature in Fort Payne, Ala. was 65°F (approximately 16 miles away), the sky was clear. It looked to me that I could have easily driven my car through the triangle. The objects were far off in the vast at 8:55 (± 3 min).
