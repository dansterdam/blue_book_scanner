Wright-Patterson, AFB, Ohio.

Dear Col.Quintanilla:

As last I have made a full reluotion for the atmospheric path of the 1958 March 5 object, which I have been informed was the sighuing of a certain USAF missile.

Also for this curiosity I have made a solution of it's orbit, as it appears to be quite irregular and of low altitude.

As you may know, many of the reports came from the Philade;phia area if you would like to publish this solution in the next Bluebook release, it would be about 300-800 words of text, as I guess.

A publication may not be feasible due to security regulations, but I thought you should have this for your files. In any event, I have nothing on the 12 April ob3ect of which you write.

Sincerely yours,
