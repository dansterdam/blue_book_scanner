The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page describes an observed depression and simulation tests conducted to study the phenomenon.

each depression and consist of a ridge of material built up on the inside surface of each depression. The ridge is not uniform in height but is divided and curved as shown by photograph. The outside diameter of each depression appears to be less compacted than the ground surface of the immediate vicinity.

Simulation Tests:
1. In an effort to simulate the observed depressions, these Laboratories conducted a limited series of tests based on the hypothesis that some mechanism other than static or dynamic loading produced the unique appearance.
k. A standard sieve analysis completed on the material sent to us from the site revealed a sandy material similar in gradation to bank run sands present in the Chinidoro sand. This material is physically similar to the Arizona sand and was selected as a site for field testing.
1. The ridges in the left-hand depression of Photograph A6 appear to be the result of a rotational digging action. To test this hypothesis, simulation tests in the laboratory and in the field were accomplished and recorded on Photographs 01 through 07. Photographs 01 through 03 were taken in the laboratory using a simulating photograph taken at the nearby gravel pit.
m. The device used to make depressions in the laboratory was a steel pipe measuring 6" x 7" x 1/2". Photographs 01 and 02 show the pattern developed after standing the plate on the sand and rotating it clockwise, into the sand and at the start of each test. The raised lip with its sharp crest was caused by spillage around the leading edge of the plate and not by displacement. The ridge was formed by simply stopping.
