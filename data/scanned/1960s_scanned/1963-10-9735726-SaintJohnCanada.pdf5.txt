AEP OCT 29 1953

National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, D.C.
Gentlemen:

Several days ago, I witnessed a prolonged observation in the sky that I think deserved my curiosity.

On Oct 9, 1953, at 6:15 PM local time, I was engaged in observing the sky. At 6:30 PM, I noticed a very rapid, irregular movement in one direction about 10 degrees north of south. The object brightened and dimmed intermittently as it moved very rapidly, heading in all directions over an area about 15 degrees in extent.

The object brightened and dimmed intermittently, and I am convinced that it was not an airplane or any known type of aircraft.

I am forwarding this information for your files, in the hope that it may be of some value.

Yours respectfully,
