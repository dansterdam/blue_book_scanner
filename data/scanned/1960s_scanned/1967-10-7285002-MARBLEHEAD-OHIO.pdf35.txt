The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a letter dated October 20 and 21, 1967 from the Aerial Phenomena Office of the Department of the Air Force to the Sandsuky, Ohio Chamber of Commerce. The letter discusses UFO observations made on those dates and requests information on any aerial advertising plans or blimps that may have been present in the area at that time.

The text of the document is as follows:
