The card contains various details about a sighting that occurred on 26 July 1960 near Moose Lake, Minnesota, including the date, time, location, weather conditions, and a brief summary of the sighting. The "Conclusions" section indicates that the University of Minnesota reported receiving numerous calls about a blinking object in the sky, which was later identified as probable astronomial in nature.
