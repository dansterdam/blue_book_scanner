Text from the document:

UFO LANDINGS IN OHIO: At about 11:50 on the night of May 15th, a California motorist named Bill Mitchell reported seeing a "flying saucer" on the ground near the town of Geneva, Ohio. The man, who told his story by telephone to the Ohio State Highway Patrol, said that the object was sighted in the eastbound traffic lanes. The UFO was hovering and its color ranged from colored to white. It was observed for a moment, about eight feet off the ground, and then it suddenly accelerated and disappeared into the night sky. The motorist claimed that the driver of the vehicle also saw the object, and that both vehicles stopped to investigate. The call to the police was made from a nearby pay telephone.
