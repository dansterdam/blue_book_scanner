About 10:00 I was called a tea with light a kningly changed into a blinking red light. The object moved along and in a few minutes stopped at about 15 minutes distance. Then it started again in the distance, I called my aunt a cousin to the window and both of them saw it to. I kept watching it for a while as it made a few turns and then suddenly changed its direction and disappearance rather rapidly. It was a clear and a checked not like star or anything we have seen before. As for comparing it, I wouldn't have regulating what it was, may be a flying saucer or something. I am quite sure it was no satellite, meteor or an airplane. These sighting are a very occasional ours and there was no noise and no trail and no indication where it went to. I am hoping you will investigate this matter and let me know what it could be. Sincerely,
Blodgett
