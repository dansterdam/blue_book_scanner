OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

1 Jun 1969

Dear
This replies to your letter postmarked June 27, in which you requested evaluation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

In order for Project Blue Book to investigate a UFO sighting, the observer must report it directly to the Air Force. We do not accept secondhand reports for investigation. In addition, we cannot furnish a written copy of the over thirty days old, precise details which become blurred in the viewer's mind and an investigation is not then possible. However, there seems to be some confusion over the basic purpose and limitations of Project Blue Book. We thought that perhaps he might want to recheck his report since it does not meet the technical requirements as laid down in the regulations. If the sighting was reported as an UFO, you may be able to help him identify his sighting.

The 1969 Project Blue Book has not been published. However, we are unable to disclose in the 1969 statistics except in the statistical summary. You may bring your 1968 edition up-to-date by inserting the included sheets at pages 3 and 9.

The report of your sighting is being sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. As soon as it is evaluated, you will be notified.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIRMAN
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
