The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book report, with a form or questionnaire. The page contains a heading "34. Date you completed this questionnaire:" followed by fields for recording the date. Below that is the question "35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific point questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting." The rest of the page is blank, indicating that no further information or text is present.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted all the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific point questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
