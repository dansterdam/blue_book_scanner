questionnaire or in the lengthy section on "sighting" information:

We were staying at a cabin located seven miles north of Pine City, Minnesota, on the north end of Cross Lake when we observed these objects (lights). My parents, my wife, and I watched them for approximately one hour, at which time we all went back into the cabin for coffee and a snack.

My wife and I went outdoors again one-half hour later and observed the objects (lights) again for almost one hour (until approximately 1:10 a.m.) at which time we retired; however, the objects (lights) were still visible when we returned to our cabin.
