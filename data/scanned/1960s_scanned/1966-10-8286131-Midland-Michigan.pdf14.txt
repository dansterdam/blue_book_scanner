There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

"It's conspicuous, for a light (in the sky), to be stopped here and there over the low chemical company's reservoir, where this the real lights seemed to be standing up upon the turning. As it was climbing up, and watching it for some time, it soon stopped and stood for over a minute as a brilliant object, the sky light seemed to diminish. It reversed completely and rose and disappearred into the trees.

Partial occured the light was green which our attention was drawn to compare of the objects in the south. It reversed its direction diminishing it? and disappeared for the night."
