I first came at it through the trees and it appeared to come out of the woods and go back in. They were round and silver and seemed to be emitting some light as they moved up and down and around rather erratic. There were three of them that I saw first and they seemed to be about twenty feet across and about thirty feet from the ground. Then there were about ten or twelve of them scattered in different places. I thought they might be some kind of new aerial vehicles but they didn't make any noise and they moved around in a very unplane-like manner. They seemed to disappear into the trees and then reappear again. I thought they might be some kind of new device of some kind but I don't know what they could be. I lost sight of them after about an hour or more. There was no indication that any sound was emitted from them at all.
