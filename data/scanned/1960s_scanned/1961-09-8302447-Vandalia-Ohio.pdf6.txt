There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a series of questions and handwritten responses.

Moving on to the text extraction:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Moving from due east to due west

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

About 1/2 the size of the moon.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match stick. This will give us an approximate measure of the angular size. If you had performed this experiment, what would the result have been?

Would have first about covered the object.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

Yes - 10 to 15 seconds over the crest of the hill.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Looked like a missile.
