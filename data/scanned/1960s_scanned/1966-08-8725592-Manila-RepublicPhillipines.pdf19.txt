STATEMENT

On 4 Aug 66 while flying storm reconnaissance, the pilot brought to my attention a number of 3 lights off the left outer screen, which appeared to be in formation. 

When I first sighted them, they were heading in a westerly direction ahead and to the left of our aircraft. As they passed, they changed attitude and speed rapidly, and pulled away from us. 

Believing them to be possible refueling aircraft, I checked for lights but was unable to detect any, either visually or thru binoculars. The lights gradually disappeared from sight shortly thereafter.
