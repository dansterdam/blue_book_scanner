11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a spherical object which appeared to be suitably illuminated and which had a vapor trail. The object did not appear to have any wings or other visible appendages. The object was under constant surveillance. Possibly a weather balloon, but there were no known weather balloons in the area at the time. The object and vapor trail disturbances and movements appeared unusual.
