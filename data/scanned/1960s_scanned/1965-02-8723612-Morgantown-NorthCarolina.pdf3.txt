Transcribing the text in the document:

Dear Harrison:

I have just received your letter and I want to assure you that I was very much impressed with your story and I believe you to be entirely sincere. I would have written to you sooner but I was away from home for some time and just returned last week.

I would like to have all the details you can give me on what you saw. Just describe in your own words exactly what happened, when and where it occurred, who was with you, and any other information that you think might be relevant. I assure you that this information will be treated in the strictest confidence and your name will not be used in any report on this matter.

I look forward to hearing from you again.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature redacted]
