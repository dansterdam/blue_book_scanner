Dear Sir:

On Wednesday night July 14th, my boss and my husband were night fishing on Horsehead Lake near Decoria, Michigan. Suddenly, one of them noticed an extremely bright object descending in the sky, which they described as looking like a "cosmic ray balloon."

Rather than beaming a spotlight, the men reported that it glowed.

We all hope that you find your missing balloons.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
