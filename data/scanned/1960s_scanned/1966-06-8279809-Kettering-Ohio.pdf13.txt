The image does not contain a photograph. It shows a diagram with a compass rose and instructions for sketching the motion of an object or objects. Here is the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw the object. Draw a line from "A" to "B" on the compass to show the direction you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that 1. shows the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" or "C" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
