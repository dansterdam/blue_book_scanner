The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified object. The sketch appears to depict some kind of aircraft or spacecraft, with lines and shapes that suggest its angular size and movement. There is also some text handwritten below the sketch, which I will transcribe verbatim:

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO DO THIS WITH THE OBJECT, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE MATCH WOULD HAVE COVERED THE OBJECT. THIS WILL GIVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT FRACTION OF THE SKY IT OCCUPIED.
