1. Analysis of the negatives and prints reveals that the objects shown are apparently identical to one or three lights similiar to those previously seen with other reports of this nature wherein a lights that mentioned as presenting a strong "blimp" in the central portion. A situation similar to that mentioned in 4 previous report was reconstructed and it was found that by varying the angle of the window through which the photos were taken, the images could be caused to appear and disappear. It is accordingly concluded that the images in the sequence in which they appear, the window would tend to be slightly more for each subsequent exposure.
