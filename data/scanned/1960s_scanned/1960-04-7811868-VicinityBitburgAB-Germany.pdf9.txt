NO CASE (Information Only) 
13 April 1960 
Lexington, Massachusetts

On April 13 at Lexington, a noted Boston area meteorologist, along with his wife and family, watched a bright white UFO swoop across the sky at 8:10 P.M. The UFO moved from west to east, then made a gradual turn to the north over the eastern horizon. Sturak checked with observatories and ruled out the possibility of a satellite before reporting the sighting. Meanwhile, the Fort Monmouth, N.J. radar had tracked a UFO at about the same time - apparently the same object.
