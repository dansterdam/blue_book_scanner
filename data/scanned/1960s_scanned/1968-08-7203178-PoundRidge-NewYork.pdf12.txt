TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

POUND RIDGE, NEW YORK
August 11, 1958

At about 4:10 p.m., EDT, observer stated he had sighted a metallic disc-shaped object travelling in a SSW direction. It crossed about 50Â° of arc in approximately 5-6 seconds.

Inquiries were made to police departments of several cities and towns along the route where the object was reported. No one reported any unusual objects to these police departments. No one else in the area reported seeing any such object. There were no reports, and no meteors were reported to the American Meteor Society.

The observer said that visibility on that day was unlimited, however, visibility in the area only an hour before the sighting was very poor due to smog. The observation was an overcast sky in the area where the sighting occurred.

CONCLUSIONS: This report was carried for a time as UNIDENTIFIED, but on further study, the activity was determined, by accounts given, to bear the characteristics of a natural phenomenon. As such, the case is now being carried as a POSSIBLE NATURAL PHENOMENON in this wind.
