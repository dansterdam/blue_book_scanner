UFO PHOTOGRAPHS, NOVEMBER 1967

USAF (AFISIC)

1. Reference your OSI Communication, iq DdlD-185/70/508.
2. January 1968, subject "Alleged UFO Sighting in Texas, FRG."

- We are unable to positively identify the objects in the photographs that you forwarded to us. However, the majority of the photographs are of general lighting shows which we assume to be a natural phenomenon. The planet Venus, which was at an approximate elevation of 9.5 and an azimuth of 049.5 on September 6, 1967, and a celestial magnitude of -4.1 on November 6, 1967, and was by far the brightest astronomical body in the sky. However, without knowledge of the elevation and azimuth of the objects that Sgt Clark sighted, we are unable to positively identify the objects.

3. Several other photographs appear to be multiple exposures of an unknown light source.

4. Since the observations took place outside the limits of the United States, no further investigation will be made. Sgt Clark's photographs are attached.
