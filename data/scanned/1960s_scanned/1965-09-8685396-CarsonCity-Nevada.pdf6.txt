The text from the document is as follows:

At 8:40 PM on July 31, 1965 a Washoe County, Nevada police officer reported an unidentified flying object NE of Carson City. Simultaneous radar fixes were obtained by Tinker AFB, Oklahoma City, and Cannon AFB, Clovis, New Mexico. The officer observed the object with his binoculars for approximately 10 minutes and observed its movements: it hovered, moved up and down and laterally, then accelerated and disappeared from sight more than a mile away. As "intelligent control" was indicated during the first 10 minutes of observation when the object remained stationary, the estimated size of the object was confirmed by radar to be 10,000 ft., observed at 3,000 ft. The object remained stationary for several minutes and abruptly lost appearance when it accelerated to approximately 1000-1500 ft and returned to the original location. At which time the object moved to the east for approximately 10,000-15,000 ft and disappeared. The night sky was clear and many stars were visible. The object appeared to be about three times the size of the evening star. The UFO was estimated to be more than a mile NE of Officer **** and appeared as a "light" source. The object itself was white with a blue-green center, with a red rotating light circling the center (blinking 3-4 times per second). At approximately 1:15 Officer **** drove across town and again observed the object at approximately 1:30 AM. The object now hovering was same color and rotating light, commanded to change colors, and shape and fade out. Both Tinker AFB and Cannon AFB tracked the object to a point 15 miles southwest of Carson City, Nevada. A few minutes later, it was tracked on radar for a distance of 250 miles south of Tinker when it was lost again. A "brighter" silhouette was also noted.
