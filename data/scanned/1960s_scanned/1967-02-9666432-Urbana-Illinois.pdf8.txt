STATEMENT
"Have Operations, Champaign Area, Illinois, Secretary.
"At about 1215 hours, 27 February, 1967, Mrs. Urbana, my parents and I were driving west to intersection U.S. Highway 45. I observed a reddish oval object, about 15-20 feet above the horizon. It didn't appear to be anything like a commercial or military aircraft. It didn't appear to be anything we had ever seen before. As we kept driving, it seemed to move up and down a little, but it didn't appear to be moving laterally. It didn't appear to make any noise. I couldn't give you an estimate of the size, but it was a sizable object. It didn't appear to be anything like a satellite or meteor. It didn't appear to be anything we had ever seen before. As we kept driving, it seemed to fade away."
