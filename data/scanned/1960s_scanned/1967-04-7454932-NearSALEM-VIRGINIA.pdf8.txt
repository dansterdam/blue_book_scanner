The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is a handwritten response to question 35, which asks for "information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting." The response states "That I still see the light and I took a picture of it".

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

Date you completed this questionnaire:
Day 7 Month April Year 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
That I still see the light and I took a picture of it.
