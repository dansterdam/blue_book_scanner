The text in the document reads as follows:

"Carmel, California, February 14, 1963. Arthur Consel of Pebble Beach said he spotted a bright light and said it appeared to be falling very rapidly. He estimated the light to be about 30,000 feet and said it appeared to be a spherical object and was descending at a steep angle. He stated the object was about the size of a basketball and seemed to be surrounded by a bluish haze. After the object got lower, he said, it vanished. Mr. Consel stated he had never seen anything like this before and that it was a complete mystery to him. 2/15/63: IR Robert Gribble."
