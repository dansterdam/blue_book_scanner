It looked like a sort of glowing cloud that took on a peculiar reddish cast and a long trail or streamer behind it. As it came nearer, it seemed to take on more of a distinct form, although still rather amorphous, and there seemed to be some kind of "engine" or "propulsion" at the rear, although it was difficult to make out any detail. It was moving rather rapidly, estimated at 500-600 mph, and the bluish glow around the object seemed to indicate some kind of propulsion system, although it gave off no flame or smoke. The movement was smooth and steady with no apparent motion of the "engines," and it seemed to be under intelligent control.
