APPENDIX I
CALCULATIONS BY GINDILIN*
The possibilities of communication with other civilizations depend upon the distances between them. This distance in turn is a function of the size of the universe and the number of civilizations in it.
Restricting himself to our own galaxy, Gindilin (1965) attempts to calculate the number of civilizations existing in time with our own. The following equation is used:
Ne = Nk1k2p1p2f(tc)
(1)
Where Ne = number of civilizations in our galaxy coexisting in time with our own.
N = total number of stars in our galaxy.
k1 = factor that specifies the number of planetary systems (therefore, Nk1 is the number of planetary systems in the galaxy).
