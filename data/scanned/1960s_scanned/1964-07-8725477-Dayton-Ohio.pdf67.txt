The image appears to contain a diagram or illustration rather than a photograph. The diagram shows a compass rose and instructions for the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the observed object or objects. There is no human face or identifiable individual visible in the image.

In the text, the OCR system reads:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "a" on the circle to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when it was first sighted. Place an "b" on the compass to show you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "a" at the beginning of the path, a "b" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
