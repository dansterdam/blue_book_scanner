atmosphere will escape into space early in the planet's history
(Mercury is such an example).
3. A highly organized life may be found only on planets circling
sufficiently old stars whose ages may be estimated at several billion
years, since enormous intervals of time are necessary for the
appearance of any intelligent species on a suitable planet.
4. The star must not vary significantly in its brightness for
several billion years. During this time it must reliably and
continuously pour forth a steady stream of light and energy, never
once pulsating or altering its output to any significant degree.
5. The star must not be of multiple type, otherwise the
orbital motion of its planets would be substantially different
from the circular, and the resulting sharp, if not catastrophic,
temperature variations on the planet's surface would preclude
the possibility of life developing.
