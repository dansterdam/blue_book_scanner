The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document with a questionnaire that the witness filled out.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? It so, how?
S/---lent 

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.  

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound __a_/s_
b. Color _white_

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and compare the size of the object to the length of the match stick. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the match stick would the object have covered?
A (1) 

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you can remember such as colors, proportions, etc. and especially motion. If the object was moving, place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
