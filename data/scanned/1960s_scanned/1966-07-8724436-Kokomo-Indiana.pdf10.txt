There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page of text from a Project Blue Book report.

The oval shape of the lights is due to the angles of incidence and observation.
The failure to see beams coming up from the ground was due to the fact that there were no clouds below 16,000 feet, and since the beams were coming at a low angle from the south, the forward scatter would be low. A halo effect was seen in the area of the lights, which is accountable for by natural diffusion of light from inevitable imperfections in the light source mirrors, and from scattering of light over small angles by the atmosphere.
There seems to be no reason to assume that the source was other than the searchlights in Indianapolis.
