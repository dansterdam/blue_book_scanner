Here is the text from the document:

My name is Gerhard Voegl and I have seen unusual objects in the sky which I cannot explain satisfactorily. These objects appeared to be flying saucers. I am a resident of Santa Barbara, California, and I observed these objects on several occasions over a period of several months during the year 1964.

The objects that I observed were silvery in color, disc-shaped, and appeared to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. They would appear to hover motionless in the sky for a period of time, then suddenly accelerate and disappear from view at incredible speed. On one occasion, I observed one of the objects for several minutes as it hovered silently over the city.

I have attempted to report these sightings to local authorities, but they have been dismissive and unwilling to take my claims seriously. I am a mature and rational person, and I can assure you that I am not imagining these events. I believe that these objects are of extraterrestrial origin, and I hope that by reporting my experiences, others who have witnessed similar phenomena will come forward.

I would be more than willing to cooperate with any official investigation into these matters. Please let me know if you have any further questions or require additional information from me.

Sincerely,
Gerhard Voegl
