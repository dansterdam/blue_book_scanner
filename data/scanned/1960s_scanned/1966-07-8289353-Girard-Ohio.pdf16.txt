for it was over the tree tops and above the houses. Moon was 15 deg. in the eastern sky, object was 45 deg elevation. Exhaust was so large it covered the hole flightpath, so thick it was about 1000 ft. diam. If a jet, it is hard to tell. First saw it in the southern sky. The angle seemed to be from the east. It would have come across the Youngstown factories, twenty miles or so. (Mr. Hoevlle means, approximately 10 - 15 steel factories north of here). It couldn't help but go over the mills.
No haze or clouds, none any where. There were countless stars in the sky.
Looking directly to the east when I noticed light first appear at edge of vision when I first noticed it. Frequently saw aircraft in the air strike was in effect. Airport 5 miles north of us. Getting used to seeing that force going east and west, going north long. Can hear the jets even when they are only specks. I didn't observe protrusions, tail fins, stubby wings, etc. Perhaps this was due to the whiteness.  It wasn't a dazzling white but more like a white in a candle. Similar to a flourescent light. Little brighter than a candle. Bright shiny white in front, dusty brown. It appeared to be 15 - 30 deg. above the moon. Think the angle close. Believe I am within 5 deg. I went out Saturday morning. I went into the post office Squaudon. Major hall. Used to have a jet fighter Youngstown. Used to be going night and day about 10 years ago. Going South. Called out there. I have only mentioned it to a few people. Have come to the conclusion for the fact of national secrecy that I think it is best to keep it quiet. When I am busy I don't blind your eyes. Wasn't as white as a star. More like the white of a candle. Similar to a flourescent light. Little brighter than a candle.
