UFOs PANIC POLICE, MOTORISTS
In the last few months, the public has been alerted to sightings of UFOs. Suddenly confronted with these strange objects in the sky, some people have become panicky and even frightened. Motorists have called the police to report UFOs hovering over their cars at speeds up to 700 m.p.h. (Copy of report attached).
Some of these sightings have been confirmed, but some of the reports from the public appear to be the result of alarming illusions caused by certain atmospheric conditions and other factors. However, some of the sightings reported, especially at close range, do warrant careful investigation.
That an Exeter, New Hampshire, 18-year-old Exeter Youth, Norman J. Muscarello, was frightened when he encountered a brilliantly lighted object, estimated to be 40 feet in diameter, hovering a few feet off the ground, is not surprising. Muscarello said the object seemed to be larger than the full moon and was illuminated with red, green, and blue lights, which pulsated in a strange pattern. He watched it for about 15 minutes before it shot straight up out of sight.
After seeing the strange object, Muscarello hurried to the nearest police station and reported what he had seen. His report was taken seriously and two officers were sent to investigate. They, too, saw the object hovering over the countryside near the police station. The two policemen were so frightened by the object that they called for assistance from neighboring towns.
