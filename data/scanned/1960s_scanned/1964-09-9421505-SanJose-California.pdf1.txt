11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Round spinning object with a humming sound, about 100' in diameter, metallic in color. It appeared to be traveling at a high speed, making turns and at times stopping, hovering, and then accelerating in a straight line after reaching altitude. Witnesses say the object appeared from nowhere and took off and disappeared in a split second.

The report concluded that the observation could not be explained and was classified as an "unidentable report" due to the lack of further data or evidence to determine the nature of the sighting.
