24. The residents of [REDACTED] who have stated they are seeing UFOs are doing so in sincerity. These objects are unidentified to them, and all of the talk of UFO's has these people believing in them.

25. My own conclusion is that there is no threat to the 35th Air Division from these UFO sightings, and Air Force investigation in this matter should be terminated.
