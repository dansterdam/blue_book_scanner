"R. J. Huckert to Information Officer
U.S. Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Honorable Sir:
I am a student and am interested in the field of amateur astronomy. I am writing to you concerning a sighting which I have made of an unidentified flying object. 
It is a case of a sighting that took place on April 7, 1967 near Denville, New Jersey. At approximately 7:00 p.m. while I was observing the sky, I noticed a strange object moving across the sky at a rather rapid rate of speed. The object was moving in an erratic manner, making sudden changes in direction and speed. I observed it for several minutes until it disappeared from view. 
I am writing this letter to you in the hope that you will be able to provide me with some information concerning this sighting. I would be most grateful for any assistance you can give me in this matter.
Sincerely yours,"
