I don't see any photographs in this document. The text appears to be a description of a UFO sighting that occurred on March 12, 1967 in Oakland, California. The document provides details about the sighting, such as the time, the appearance and movement of the objects, and their size in relation to a "big dipper star". It also mentions a cloud bank that was visible in the sky.

Third Sighting
Oakland, Calif. March 12, 1967
Time, approx 6:00 PM Pacific Standard time
Five to seven UFO's
Round when coming out of clouds, levelling off they looked oval
Color, golden pinkish
Sound, none
Altitude, unknown, but I guess about 20 to 30 thousand feet
Speed off flight,
They came out of the clouds at fast clip, did a sight pause, did some fast maneuvering, both in verticle and horizontal directions
SIZE OF UFO'S
Three times the size of the big dipper stars
On March 12th between the hours of 7:30 to 8:30 the Big Dipper was in North East.
There was a cloud bank on the Oakland hills in the East which was quite high up in the sky. I had been checking the big dipper and as I looked down to the last star in the handle, the cloud bank was some distance from this star, up they came. See map of flight
