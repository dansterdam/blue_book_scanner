ABOUT 3:30 I HAPPENED TO BE OUT THE FRONT DOOR AND SAW A SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT IN CLEARWATER HARBOR, ABOUT 100 FT HIGH AND HOVERING ABOUT 100 FT ABOVE THE WATER. IT WAS SILVER IN COLOR AND APPEARED TO BE DISC OR SAUCER SHAPED, ABOUT 50 FT IN DIAMETER. IT APPEAR TO MOVE EFFORTLESSLY TO THE SOUTH ABOUT 150 FT AND THEN HOVER, AGAIN ABOUT 100 FT ABOVE THE WATER, FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS. THEN IT MOVED AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION. IT MADE NO NOISE AND LEFT NO TRAIL. NOT WAS LOOK AT MY WATCH.

VERY TRULY YOURS
