THE 1IND/41 ACLD / REPORT NAS CONTACTED DIY A SPECIAL AGENT OF THE DIVISION, FOLLOWED BY A TELEPHONE CALL TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTING WITNESS. OUR RESIDENT TECHNICAL ADVISOR HAS ALSO BEEN CONSULTED AND HIS VIEWS ARE INCORPORATED IN THIS SUMMARY.

LOCATION: MIDWESTERN - U. S. 
DATE: 8 NOVEMBER 1960
TIME: APPROXIMATELY 1930 HOURS (7:30 P. M. STANDARD)
WEATHER: CLEAR WITH A FEW SCATTERED CLOUDS, WIND OUT OF THE NORTH AT 10 MPH. TEMPERATURE AROUND 50 F.

OBSERVER(S): ONE ADULT MALE, AGE 42, EMPLOYED AS A RADIO ENGINEER BY A MIDWESTERN ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURING FIRM. DESCRIBED AS BEING OF INTELLIGENT APPEARANCE AND ARTICULATE IN SPEECH. NO OTHER OBSERVER(S).

OBJECT DESCRIPTION: CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, ABOUT 60 FEET IN DIAMETER, GRAYISH-WHITE IN COLOR. OPAQUE, NOT TRANSPARENT. APPEARED TO BE METALLIC IN TEXTURE. SURROUNDED BY A BLUISH GLOW OR HALO. NO EXTERNAL PROTUBERANCES OR DETAILS VISIBLE.

FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS: OBJECT OBSERVED HOVERING OVER A FIELD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN ACCELERATED RAPIDLY IN A VERTICAL DIRECTION AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN SECONDS. NO TRAIL OR EXHAUST VISIBLE.

SOUND: SILENT DURING ENTIRE OBSERVATION.

DURATION: APPROXIMATELY 3 TO 5 MINUTES.

INVESTIGATION: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS BY OUR CONSULTANT INDICATES THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS MOST PROBABLY A WEATHER BALLOON OR SIMILAR TYPE DEVICE. HOWEVER, THE EXTREMELY RAPID VERTICAL ACCELERATION AND DISAPPEARANCE RULE OUT A CONVENTIONAL BALLOON. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE PRESENCE OF AN UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR SPACECRAFT. SIGHTING REPORT WAS DETAILED AND APPEARS CREDIBLE BASED ON THE OBSERVER'S DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND.

CONCLUSION: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. RECOMMEND NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION AT THIS TIME.
