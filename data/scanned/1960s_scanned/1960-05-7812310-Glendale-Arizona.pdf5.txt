The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Even though the investigator did not ask, made in the report that was not wanted an entry seen a UFO, but something which he could not explain and whatever it might have been, it wasn't an object picked up by the "Dust Devil".
He answered all questions as though he had spent some time thinking of all the important details concerning the sighting and even though the investigator purposefully tried to catch him into answering some of the questions in a manner which would conflict with previous questions, he would not fall for the bait. At one stage he even tried to coach the investigator into asking some additional questions.
On the basis of the interview the reliability of the report of the sighting is rated F-3.
(3) Preliminary Analysis:
Probably saw a white piece of paper which had been picked up and was being tossed about by the wind.
The inversion over the Phoenix Area at the time of observation could have caused reflections or the bending of light rays which would cause the white object plucked up by the wind to react in many way, when observed by the human eye.
1. No physical evidence.
