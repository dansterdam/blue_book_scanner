Dear Friends, 

I've misplaced my first letter to you about the light I saw floating over a year ago at Mark Keppel High School at night. And I was surprised that you even wanted any additional information from me.

I've also misplaced or lost page 1 and 2 of your forms, but like Xerxes of old who couldn't sleep when he caused the Book of the Kings of Assyeria to be read to him and found out about Mordecai saving his life, I as a master sergeant for God should, since a law abiding citizen, mail you the forms I completed months ago, and at that time I had the first two pages too.

If you'll give me a copy of my letter relating to this and the first forms with the others I can mail them back with any information I have stored in the SECRET part of my brain. But I really doubt if that is really important as now-a-days we are getting away from back seargents.

I'll really believe in our form of D_emocracy when all rated R.O.T.C. seargents are retired on a pension like Eisenhouses and one stenographers instead of $83.00 monthly Social Security check which they won't even pay unless we volunteer to be executed like the Two Veterans killed years ago in a Gulfport hospital.

Without Military training I would'n't have been in my own church, which church I now request to admit qualified Colored Persons on one Summer Sunday in 1953. I disturbed no one but a Mississippi Poll-Tax citizen who "so efficiently" deprived me of a lawyer.
