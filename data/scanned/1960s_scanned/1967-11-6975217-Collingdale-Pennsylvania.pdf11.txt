IS WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

It looks like someone has filled out a report or questionnaire about an observed UFO phenomenon. The report asks various questions about the observed behavior of the UFO, such as whether it moved in a straight line, stood still, suddenly sped up, broke apart, changed brightness, spun, made noise, or caught the observer's attention in some other way. The bottom of the form appears to have a handwritten description of what was observed, though the text is not entirely legible in the provided image.
