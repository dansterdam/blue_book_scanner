The image does not contain a photograph. The page appears to be part of a typed document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text describes the writer's preparation of an IPSO FACTO, a statement of religious doctrine, in connection with the New York state Constitutional Convention. The text also mentions a report of a sighting of a UFO on September 23, 1967 in Rochester, New York.

Text extracted from the document:

2nd OF REPORT OF SIGHTINGS OF UFO OF SEP'T 23, 1967, Rochester,
New York (Monroe Cy)

Notes: The writer at about this time was preparing, and filed
IPSO FACTO, a statement of religious doctrine with the New
York state Constitutional Convention. Consideration of the appearance of the UFO and the filing of the religious statement
indicates to the writer a clam of approval or authorization
by God to the religious case, despite the apparent antagonism
between the article to publish and the official face, etc. this is a direct statement which
cannot be substantiated, but in logic no subjective or internal knowledge obtains to the remarks made in the note.
