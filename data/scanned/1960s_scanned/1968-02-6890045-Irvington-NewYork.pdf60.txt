1968 March 20

Major Hector Quintanilla,
USAF, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Two letters from you March 28 and November 2, 1967 refer to an earlier communication from you APS which was in turn a report from Piqua ville, Ohio on that date of April 1967 - SUBJECT: REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) OBSERVED OVER IRVINGTON, NEW YORK ON SEPT. 9, 1967.

First: object or 1967 Sept. 27 - Report from Piqua ville, Ohio on an object observed over Irvington, New York on that date of Sept. 27, 1967. They report that the object was in sight for about 10 to 15 minutes, that it was metallic and had a bright orange glow, that it moved at high speed and zig-zagged, and that it finally disappeared by streaking off to the east at an extremely high speed. They state that the object was the size of a car and the color was definitely not a reflection from the sun. Several competent observers reported seeing this object.

Second: Report by J.A. Marshall for 1968 Feb. 26 on:
His report states a bright orange light was sighted over Irvington, New York, 4/28/68, about 9:30 P.M. EST, by several citizens. This case is exactly as such: I have no other information. There was no investigation by any agency as such, and no conclusion could be drawn. Should you require any further details I would be happy to consult the records.

Sincerely yours,

Charles T. Olivieri
