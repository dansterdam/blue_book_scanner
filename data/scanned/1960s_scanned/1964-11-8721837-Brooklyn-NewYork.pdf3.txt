Sir:

On Saturday night, 10:57 PM EST in New York (Brooklyn) I sighted an object resembling across the sky it is what I it appeared to originate (as if it was turned on by a switch) very close to the star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. The direction in which it traveled was from Betelgeuse to the 5 stars in its train. It was fairly bright (about 1st magnitude) and the color of the star Rigel-a bluish white. It was round and was very small-the size of how a star appears. It was moving pretty fast-it went to the horizon in about 2-3 seconds. It had no tail at all, and actually looked like a satellite would look but it was much faster. I have a fairly good knowledge in astronomy and so I made a list of things it could possibly be and checked out all of the objects that could not appear as that did. I have down-some-no tall and too fast, meteor-no - so you can only see balloons one-half hour or more and this was in the middle of the night, airplane-no-no blinking lights, no outline of plane, no noise, too fast. As you see I have checked off most of the things it could possibly be. I called up the Air Force Base (Floyd Bennet Field) and they told me to write to you. I hope you can find out what it was - as I am very curious.

Thank you very much.
