Dear Sirs, I have registered your Project Blue book to study my case. This should be case number 4. We have reported this to the U.S.O. we have talked to the representative of the U.S.O. one Catalina, on November 30, 1956. On November 30, 1956 about 8:43 p.m. we sighted an unidentified flying object. It was a bright light in the sky over Catalina. The object hovered there for about ten minutes. It then moved down towards the coast of Catalina and was lost from sight. Shortly after another unidentified flying object came from the southwest toward the northeast. It was about the size of a plane but moved at a much greater speed. It passed over Catalina in about 5 to 10 seconds and disappeared from sight. We would like you to investigate this incident. Please let us know if you need any more information. Sincerely.
