The image contains two sketches or illustrations. The first illustration is a compass rose diagram, which appears to be a navigational tool used to indicate the directions. The second illustration contains two smaller sketches depicting a person standing in a rural or mountainous landscape.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can extract the text from the document:

AA. HOW HEADING IS YOU ARE ALL THE COMFAS. DOES ROSE. PLATES ARE AS TO THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION BEARINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED THROUGH OBSERVATION. PLACE A DOT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE COMPASS IS INDICATED.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A Y AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON AT THE CLOSEST DISTANCE, AND A Z WHERE IT DISAPPEARED. ATTEMPT TO SKETCH THE OBJECT OR OBJECTS OF THE PHENOMENON AND SHOW THEIR RELATIVE POSITION AT EACH STAGE OF THE SIGHTING. SCALE THE SKETCH TO INDICATE DISTANCE AND DIRECTION.
