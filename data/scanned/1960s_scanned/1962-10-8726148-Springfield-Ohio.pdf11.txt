This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document, possibly a UFO investigation report from Project Blue Book.

The text on the page is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

[Handwritten response]

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

[Handwritten response]

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object which is about the same apparent size and type as the object which you saw.
