The image does not contain any visible photographs, only text and some redacted portions. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

March 4, 1968

I compare this with meteorites, missile re-entries and satellites. I hope this information is helpful to you. I made a complete report to the USAF Center and heard perhaps a would enjoy a chat with you.

Yours very truly,
