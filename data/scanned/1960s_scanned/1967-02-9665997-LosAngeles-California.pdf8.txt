35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionaire: I was travelling west on Van Oven street in Van Nuys, Calif., when I noted an object which seemed to be quite unusual. It was first seen moving upward at a fast rate of speed. It then appeared to hesitate and move in a horizontal direction and then disappear downward as if it had gone into the ocean. The object appeared to be approximately 500-800 meters distant and at an elevation of possibly about 500-800 feet. Its size would have been approximately that of a small automobile, perhaps smaller. Its color was not observed, as it appeared to be silhouetted against the sky, and did not reflect sunlight. There was no sound audible. I, in fact, did not actually see a takeoff or landing, but only the horizontal movement. There is no known object I am aware of that would have moved in the same manner as this object did. I would have said it was a helicopter, but there was absolutely no sound, and the motion was sharply horizontal and then disappearance downward, which is not the normal flight path of a helicopter.
