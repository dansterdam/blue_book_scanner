And a object in the state of North Carolina in the country of New Hanover and a large object in the night sky over Lumberton North Carolina over an extended period of time. All witnesses believed the object to be a large glowing object of mine material that was well below 1000ft in altitude. Near the object there appeared to be a smaller object or objects in formation with the larger object. The objects appeared to have no windows or visible markings but the larger object seem toshine extremely bright. The smaller objects in formation with the larger object would dart in and out of the larger object in an erratic and rapid pattern. All witnesses were amazed and scared at what they were witnessing but continued to observe it for over an hour. The objects finally moved rapidly out of sight to the northwest. All witnesses signed sworn affidavits to verify the event. Apparently a government agent arrived at the site the next day to investigate.
