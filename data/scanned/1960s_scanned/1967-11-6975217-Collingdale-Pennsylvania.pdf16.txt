"We were walking through a wooded area when I saw a very bright light of the moon. It had to have been at least 60 feet away indicated the object started to what the moon and light went off to the other direction. Light seemed to be shut off to the other direction. Possible could have gone into woods before light was finally off. If possible would you send me any information on Project Blue Book.
It seemed to be too bright to be a star or Comet - and moved too fast to be the moon."
