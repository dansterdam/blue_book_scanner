There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a typed text describing a sighting of a "flying saucer" or unidentified flying object.

Report:
Flying saucer div. 
From where I stood looking out across side about right I noticed a dark object hovering over the top of a group of trees a few hundred yards away. I counted 10-15 seconds. The object appeared to be a round or disc shaped thing about 10-15 feet in diameter. Nothing that the best was to describe it was to say that the object was 10 feet high and I stood 25 yards away and watched it closely. 
In having a parachute bottom, I had it completely covered on another object and sand lotter effect was not seen. 
While I called to my brother's attention, she noticed it also. Said it looked like a light bulb, but gave out streaks of light.
