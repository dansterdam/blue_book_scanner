READER : FOR THERE IS THE SKY, COMING
FRUH THE STAR DIRECTION AS THE SECOND 

TIME - THE SKY DEEPENED AGAIN, WHAT -
WHAT CAME AS CEDENTS ? 

WELL, WHAT HAS STUNNED ME MOST, FROM
THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE, IS THAT, THIS 
TIME, THE STAR STOPPED SOMEWHERE
WAY OFF TO MY LEFT, BEING, I BELIEVE,
ABOUT NORTH EAST, IT WAS ONLY FOR
A COUPLE OF SECONDS, - BUT I DON'T
BELIEVE MY EYES DECEIVED ME, AS I HAVE
VERY GOOD VISION - 20/20. IT THEN
PROCEEDED TO MOVE AGAIN AND BEGAN LONG,
IT ALSO VANISHED OVER THE HORIZON. 

NOW I AM NOT A TRUE-BLUE ASTRO-GHOST,
BUT A STAR'S HAVE HAD A DEEP INTEREST
IN THE UNIVERSE AND IT'S MYSTERIES. IT
SEEMS THAT I MUST KNOW OR AT LEAST
HAVE AN IDEA WHAT IT WAS. I COULD HAVE
SEEN ON THESE TWO OCCASIONS.
