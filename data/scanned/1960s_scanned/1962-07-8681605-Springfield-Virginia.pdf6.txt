Dear Major Hart:

On the morning of July 13 at approximately 2:30 E.D.T. I saw an unidentified flying object. This object was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. While still traveling east it seemed to lose altitude and slowed down. Then it was disappearing behind some trees a few blocks from my house. This may sound a little crazy, but I believe it included a night following it. I thought I heard a faint buzzing sound but it might have been my radio because at that time some static-like interference came on it. I am sure the static on the radio was from the U.F.O. because it was only there while this object was in sight. If you would let me know if you get any other reports of this?
