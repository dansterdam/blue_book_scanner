The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document states:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I can assure that my report was mailed on April 7, 1966
The object in my report was unusual enough for me to report it, though I realize that many sightings have very trivial explanations.
