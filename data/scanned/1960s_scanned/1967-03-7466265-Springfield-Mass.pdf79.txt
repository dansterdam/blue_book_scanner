A MORE RECENT REPORTED SIGHTING OCCURRED ON 30 MARCH 1967 IN RIO COMPRIDO, HOWEVER, THIS ONE WAS EXPECTED ONLY BY GROUND OBSERVERS. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS COMPLETELY WHITE, SILENT, FLYING AT LOW ALTITUDE, AND WOULD DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR AT REGULAR INTERVALS. THIS PARTICULAR SIGHTING RECEIVED VERY LITTLE PUBLICITY IN THE NEWS MEDIA.

COMMENTS: AS YET THE AIR MINISTRY HAS NOT ISSUED ANY OFFICIAL COMMENT ON THESE SIGHTINGS AND IS PRESENTLY STUDYING THE STATEMENTS OF THE AIRCRAFT CREWS AND GROUND OBSERVERS.
