The image does not contain a photograph. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report documenting a UFO sighting that occurred on July 11, 1966 in Union, Pennsylvania. The report provides details about the sighting, including that observers saw a large, bright, red object with small windows and yellow lights shining in from a hay field. The witnesses watched the object for a short time and noticed a humming noise and a grinding noise coming from it. The report concludes that the case is categorized as "unidentified" since there is no plausible explanation.
