Enclosure: Map of Kane, Pennsylvania Area

Dear Lt. Tobey:

The letters recently forwarded to GAC regarding aerial phenomena sited by local residents of north central Pennsylvania on 3 March 1968 have been examined.

It is concluded from this new information that at least three pieces traveled beyond impact area A, reported earlier. Two of these three pieces could have landed in area B. The third piece evidently continued beyond area B, probably landing in area C.

If you feel it is warranted a more exact analysis could be performed using the GAC 3-degree-of-freedom re-entry program. However, such an analysis would only be worthwhile if additional information can be made available regarding the orbit of these items.
