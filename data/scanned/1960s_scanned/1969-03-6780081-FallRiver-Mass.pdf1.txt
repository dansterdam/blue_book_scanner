The observer sighted an object that looked similar to a meteor. It traversed from South to South East and appeared to stop. The observer went into the house and when he came out again it was gone. The observer is 13 years old and has seen other similar UFOs. Since the observer does not state how long it took the moving light to stop, the observation time could have been longer than 25 minutes. The secondary light source was probable a star.
