SUBJECT: Evaluation of Radar Scope Photos

REFERENCE is made to AFPRO letter of 21 December 1965, subject: "Technical Evaluation of Radar Scope Photos".

The following comments pertain to the radar observations:

a. It is to be noted that the technical evaluation of this report is limited in scope and is frequency of the scope presentation, but changes in operation made during maintenance and on general radar conditions.
b. The variations in the scope presentation are so extensive that it is impossible to determine real targets from false target indications due to the condition of the radar. These variations include:
(1) Is this weather radar?
(2) Was the antenna file angle varied?
(3) Was MT or other circuit variations switched in or out during the observations?

c. It appears obvious that considering the large number of returns, the general lack of appreciable speed in azimuth, and the randomness of their activity, these targets were NOT material targets, but rather represented various forms of electrical interference, which will be commented on individually and briefly.
