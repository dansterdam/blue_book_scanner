Report of: DATE: 2/12/67
CASE: REN #15/160 CONNECTICUT
FROM: GLD to 6/40 PI 832
Location: GILROY, MASSACHUSETTS

Witness:
Name: Mrs. ********
(and Husband)

Apparent Size: 4' ARC Smaller
Shape: ROUND, FLICKERING GLOW

OBSERVATION:
Mrs. ******** has obviously exaggerated the apparent size of the object. the object was seen several times larger than a bright star to the chairman via a telescope prior to actual personal interview.

REMARKS:
Notes versus: Venus was lower and in the west (set approx. 7:06 PM). Witness claims V-shaped object description likely erroneous and may have actually been a helicopter or jet, as no red lights on each side of the V were actually described. This UFY object described was of red, flickering lights. distant red lights.
