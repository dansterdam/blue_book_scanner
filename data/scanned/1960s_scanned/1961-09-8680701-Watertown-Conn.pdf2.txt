Dear [Redacted],

Your letter of September 30 addressed to the Department of Defense has been forwarded to this office.

It is not possible to tell you what the objects were which you say were observing the stars nor is it possible to determine the combination of factors involved since we have no other observational data. Harvard observatory further compounded the eye-strain due to the intensity of the lights (which is long since discounted).

I know that this is not too helpful. We are limited in the information we can give you and the actual observations by you would be the only ones of value. I would like to recommend that you continue to observe and report any UFO sightings as many observations are still providing a great deal of information.

Your interest is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
