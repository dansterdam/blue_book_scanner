PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR: 64-66
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: South Charleston, Ohio
DATE: 31 October 1964
PHOTOGRAPHY: 
PHOTO NRS: One negative and three prints provided by USAF
PURPOSE: This report answers work request #64-109 submitted by Major H. Quintanilla, Jr., Chief of Investigations Division, regarding an analysis of the photographic data submitted on the 'Unidentified Flying Object' observed in the South Charleston, Ohio area on 31 October 1964 by Processing personnel.
RESULTS: A careful analysis and review of the provided subject negative and prints with the following results:
a. A series of exposures prior to the film plate loading or after removing the film from a clip holder were caused by a light entry into the camera during the film loading or unloading process, which produced an area of overexposure.
b. This superimposed image was probably caused by a reflection from a housed light source.
c. The sharpest image on the negative and prints is probably caused by a light bulb reflection and a screen over the reflector, such as is commonly used for ceiling lighting.
