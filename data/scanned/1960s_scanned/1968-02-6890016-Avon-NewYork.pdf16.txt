The image contains a photograph that appears to be a page from a project Blue Book UFO report document. The page includes various questions and prompts related to analyzing UFO sightings, as well as a compass-like diagram and a space for drawing a sketch of the motion and path of observed objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curved line to show where the object was when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

A LARGE OBJECT MOVED RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SKY. IT PASSED FROM EAST TO WEST, TOP TO BOTTOM. THE OBJECT HOVERED FOR A MOMENT.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

A SMALLER FLASHING LIGHT MOVED NORTH.
