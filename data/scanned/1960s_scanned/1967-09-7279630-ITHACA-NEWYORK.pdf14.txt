The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, possibly a report, that describes observations of a rectangular object or objects in the sky.

The text in the document states:

Indicates to this observer the existence of a plane, rectangular figures for instance, dimension as appeared to equal several feet in length and width, while passing down to several hundred yards, giving a full view when one observed the object, usual height of rectangulars circles, then distances which make up the object. The writer did not at the time of observation make a comprehensive measurement, data related thereto is from recollection. So that, as it may, and with the understanding of the same time, the recollection may be active or less near the actual facts than that of the writer.

The following estimated size of the object is given: perhaps at an altitude of several hundred feet, perhaps five hundred feet, and of course, respectively one inch in diameter, near symbol c, the UFO unit nearest thereto, at an altitude in feet, of dimensions as common visualization hundreds of feet, that the object apparently was less near, several sixteenths of an inch, perhaps three or four sixteenths of an inch.

The text further discusses the estimated size and distance of the object, stating that it was observed at an altitude of several thousands of feet, estimated twenty-two fourths of an inch, possibly six-eighths of an inch. The writer states they do not know how it terminated.

The document then discusses the writer's observations and inability to make precise measurements, as well as their belief that the object was of terrestrial origin rather than extraterrestrial.
