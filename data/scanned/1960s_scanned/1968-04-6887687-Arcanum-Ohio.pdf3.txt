SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFOS) THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED. PLEASE ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS. THE INFORMATION YOU GIVE WILL BE USED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.

Object observed in western sky moving south
IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. PLACE AN X ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE PHENOMENON WAS ABOVE THE HORIZON. BE SURE TO PLACE A POINT ON THE SAME CURVED LINE TO SHOW THE ANGULAR DIAMETER, OR HOW WIDE, THE PHENOMENON WAS WHEN LAST SEEN.
