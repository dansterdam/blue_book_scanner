TEXT OF THE DOCUMENT:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curve where the object was when you first saw it. Place a circle on the curve where the object was when you last saw it. Indicate by an arrow the direction the object was traveling. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

27. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? (Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.)
