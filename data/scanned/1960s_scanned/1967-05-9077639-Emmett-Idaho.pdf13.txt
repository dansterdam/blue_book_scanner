The text in the document reads:

The Honorable Len B. Jordan
June 30, 1967
Page 2

There are many of us who feel that the public is entitled to have information concerning unidentified flying objects. It is my opinion that our representatives in Congress should be provided with this information, if any, pertaining to this subject from reliable sources, to be inserted in the Congressional Record.

As you probably know, I am a Lieutenant Colonel in the Air Force Reserve, Justice Department, and a Major in the Air Force. Recently I have been questioned about unidentified flying objects, which are also observed by some members of Congress. All of us who have questioned these boys on an examination of the facts and evidence presented to them, have become somewhat impressed with the magnitude of the problem, and the fact that results accompanied by evidence do not appear to have been made available to the Congress or the public.

I never dreamed that I would be writing a letter of this nature so soon, but due to our personal acquaintance over the years, I now feel that you would conclude that I was impressed with this report and these boys, or I wouldn't be bothering you with this part of the report. Personal regards,

Very truly yours,

P.S. I might state that the original photograph, under magnification, shows some structural detail, but I presume it would mean much more to a trained photo interpreter.
