Dear Sirs,
Our flying saucer case information was received and we would like to respond.
On Aug. 26, 1960, Friday night, a number of persons saw an object in the western sky over Springville, New York. According to them, it was approximately 40 feet in diameter, brilliant white in color, and giving off a pulsating type of light. 
It was observed for about one minute, then all of a sudden it disappeared. The disappearance was somewhat dramatic, according to the witnesses, as it seemed to simply vanish into thin air.
We would appreciate any information you can provide on this case.
Sincerely yours,
