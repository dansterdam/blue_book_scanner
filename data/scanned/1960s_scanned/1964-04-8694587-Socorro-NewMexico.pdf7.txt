The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a newspaper article from the New York Journal American dated April 29, 1964, with the headline "Astronomer Hunts Clue To 'Saucer'".

Here is the text from the document:

SOCORRO, N. M., April 29 (AP)--An astronomer who examined the strange object seen here by a policeman took soil samples today in an effort to determine what it was.
Dr. J. Allen Hynek said he would visit the site where the policeman, Lonnie Zamora, said he saw a luminous, egg-shaped object land and then take off, causing the ground to burn.
Zamora said the object was about 20 feet long and 15 feet wide and had red lettering on its side. Authorities found scorched grass and indentations in the ground at the Socorro site and near Espanola, 30 miles away.
Dr. Hynek said he hoped to finish his investigation here today. He said he has found most people present and sincere in reporting flying object sightings, though some "unexplained natural phenomena, re birds, weather balloons, even stars, are often responsible for such reports." He noted the reports often come from persons who are something involved in the event - like the Socorro policeman.
