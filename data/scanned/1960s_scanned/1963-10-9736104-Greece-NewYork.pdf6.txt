The image contains two illustrations. The first illustration shows a sketch with a curved line representing the horizon and an object above it, and instructs the viewer to indicate the height of the object above the horizon. The second illustration shows a compass-like object with arrows pointing in various directions.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
