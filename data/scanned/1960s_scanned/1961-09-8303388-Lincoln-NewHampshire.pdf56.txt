INVESTIGATOR:  
MAJOR LAWRENCE J. TACKER  
REPORT  
ON  
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING   
LINCOLN, NEW HAMPSHIRE  
8 SEPTEMBER 1961  
1. BACKGROUND  
On 8 September 1961, at approximately 2000 hours, an unidentified flying object was reportedly sighted in the sky over Lincoln, New Hampshire, by Mrs. Evelyn D. Frost, a resident of that town.  Mrs. Frost reported the sighting to the State Police and the incident was subsequently referred to the United States Air Force. An investigation of the incident was conducted by Major Lawrence J. Tacker, Headquarters USAF, on 9 September 1961.  
2. DETAILS OF SIGHTING  
Mrs. Frost stated that the object was first observed at approximately 2000 hours on 8 September 1961, as she was observing the sky from the window of her home. The object was described as appearing larger than a star, and it seemed to be very high in the sky. Mrs. Frost stated that the object emitted a bright, pulsating light which changed colors, going from red to green and then to yellow. She watched the object for approximately 20 minutes, during which time it remained stationary in the sky.  
3. CONCLUSION  
Based on the investigation conducted, it is the conclusion of the United States Air Force that the object sighted by Mrs. Frost was a star or planet, the apparent pulsation and color change being caused by atmospheric conditions. No evidence was found to indicate the presence of an unidentified flying object.
