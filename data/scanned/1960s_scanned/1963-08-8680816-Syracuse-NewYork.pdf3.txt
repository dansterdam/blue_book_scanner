Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear Sirs,
Last August while visiting Syracuse, New York I was watching an apparent other man-made object doing some strange maneuvers. U.F.O.s that were traveling at such great speed that crossed the entire sky were followed by an international team and when reported to the Air Defense Command Headquarters for operation information. Others had reported them that day also.

I have been very interested in U.F.O. sightings & have searched all the books in the library that I could get my hands on. I have collected a number of reports on this subject. Being a writer, I am greatly interested in such additional information on this matter. If you have any information on this matter I would sincerely appreciate it.

Sincerely,

Maj., Ret. Air Force
