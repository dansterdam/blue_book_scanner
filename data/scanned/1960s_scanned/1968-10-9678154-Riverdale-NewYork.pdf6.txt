The image contains two illustrations. The top illustration appears to be a compass or radar display with various directional labels. The bottom illustration depicts a person standing on a road or path, with blurred or hazy landscapes in the background on either side.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE IN THE CENTER OF THIS COMPASS. THIS IS WHAT A PERSON WOULD SEE STANDING IN THE CENTER OF A STRAIGHT LINE AT THE TIME HE FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT WAS STATIONARY AND HOVERED OVERHEAD WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND AS THE WITNESS TURNED SLOWLY HIS POSITION INDICATES THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE OBJECT CAME AND TO WHICH IT WENT. THIS DRAWING IS DESIGNED TO INDICATE HOW A WITNESS CAN POINT OUT THE DIRECTION OF SIGHTED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.

THE SKETCH BELOW SHOWS AN APPEARANCE AS OBSERVED AND DRAWN BY THE WITNESS. IT PURPORTS TO REPRESENT AN OBJECT THAT APPEARS STATIONARY AND HOVERED OVER THE WITNESS WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND THEN MOVED OFF IN THE DIRECTION INDICATED ON THE COMPASS ABOVE. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF LOCATION OF SIGHTING.
