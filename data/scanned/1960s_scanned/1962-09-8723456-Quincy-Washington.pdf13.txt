"That Wisconsin "UFO"

In the early morning hours of 5 September 1948, a young housewife, Mrs. Warren Frazier, resident of Westby, Wisconsin, witnessed an extraordinary and spectacular aerial phenomenon. She called the local police and sheriff's office, since the object which had descended through the atmosphere several small and one large burst of light, causing pieces to fall to the ground, continued to hover approximately fifty feet from the ground. The cry of "UFO" was coined, and soon citizens,
law officers, and amateur "UFO" researchers and photographers rushed to the scene. It became quite apparent that the abovementioned incident had alarmed the local populace, and the object which had burned and broke up coming into the earth's atmosphere had caused quite a stir and commotion."
