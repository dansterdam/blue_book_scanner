The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a typed document that describes a UFO sighting.

It was bright like a star or a light, but too large to be a star. The object was strong and steady. After the sun rose it did not seem as strong and steady. The object seemed to be lower down than the light reflected by Venus. The object appears to have some coverage behind it, so I probably would have dismissed it unusually bright stars or planets.

Presently on duty in the Navy on the a, however. I live in North Little Rock ail would be glad to answer any questions that you may have about this incident. But please do not publish this report of information. I have taken the liberty of reporting this incident to justify reporting it.

The text at the bottom appears to be a U.S. Air Force document from the "U.F.O. Investigation" in Jacksonville, Arkansas.
