TEHAMA COUNTY
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTAL CRIME REPORT
1960 4:00 P.M.

"More Objects In Sky?
New Reports Are Made"
In Mineral Tehama County, Deputy Sheriffs at Mineral Lodge reported that they received several reports during the day of bright lights and unidentified flying objects being seen across the sky. According to J. Gonzales, who is the Manager at the Mineral Lodge, "Up to the present" the "Manager received about three daily reports of such objects being seen." Gonzales stated that all UFO appearances were also reported to the Air Force Office at Red Bluff.

"The tree lines from the Lodge indicate that the objects were visible for a long distance" and some observers said the lights were 'very erratic in motion and changing colors". The objects were seen during the daytime as high as 20,000 feet, according to observers. Gonzales also said the objects were picked up on radar at the Red Bluff Air Force weather station. Law enforcement agencies throughout the County received a number of reports of the sightings.
Perry and Gonzales said the objects moved at high speed and made abrupt turns, which they said would be impossible for any conventional aircraft. Alton Brown and a Mrs. Carlson both reported seeing the objects and both gave similar descriptions.
They said the objects appeared as "whitish and red lights" that seemed to "hover and dart" across the sky. No other details were reported.

Gonzales said that in his opinion it was not possible for the objects to have been conventional aircraft. He would estimate the speed of the objects to have been around 1,000 mph. However, he could not make any definite statement as to what the objects actually were.
