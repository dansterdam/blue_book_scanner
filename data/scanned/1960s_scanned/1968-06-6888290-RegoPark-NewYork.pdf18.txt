Dear Project Blue Book,
I want to thank you for sending me the information on U.F.O.'s. I think we are wasting our time to send the Air Force letters. The reason is because of the U.F.O. sightings near the Air Force bases. These creatures may be planning to attack us right now.
I think the reason for all these sightings is because the creatures want to find out about our Defense System. Also if their ships can fly like we are told, then they could demolish us. So I think we should act now and put out an order to shoot any U.F.O. which will not communicate. I hope you will take this theory seriously.
I will expect an answer. Thank you.
Sincerely yours,
Mr. [REDACTED]
