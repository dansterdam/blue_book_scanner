Fiji Has A Fireball
On the 3rd of April 1963 Mrs. A. E. Gale, of Suva, Fiji Islands, woke up about 3:30 a.m. and gazed through her window at what appeared to be a moving object in the sky over Suva. It appeared to be moving toward Laucala Bay. She said it was "thunderlike" and 15 minutes earlier three Fijian policemen at Ba had reported seeing a similar object and at 4:30 a.m. a Mrs. W. E. Cook had reported seeing a strange object falling into the sea at Laucala Bay. About 5:30 a.m. the same morning they said they watched a huge fireball fall into the sea which was whitish and made a great deal of noise. The area was bathed in a light as bright as moonlight which seemed to be coming from a falling object. Another witness said the falling object looked to him like the classic example of a Hollywood greenish-white light and had an enormous long fiery orange tail.
