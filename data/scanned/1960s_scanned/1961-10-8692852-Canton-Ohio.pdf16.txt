The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a text document that appears to be part of a Project Blue Book UFO report. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

Walter S. Dornfeld and John D. Drazba
Investigate a UFO Report on October 8, 1961
at Canton, Ohio.

The object appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter and 15 to 20 feet thick. It had flashing lights around its perimeter and a bright light on the underside which appeared to illuminate the ground beneath it. The object made no noise and was observed for approximately 15 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.
