The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, with text and form fields for the observer to fill out details about a sighting.

Text from the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: 
b. Color: Grayish white, large ellipsical, like moon

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

Followed by a hand-written response:
