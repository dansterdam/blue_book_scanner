Dear Mr. _____,

Please excuse our delay in answering your letter concerning your observation on December 15, 1966. A basic report describing this sighting as we discussed it during the interview is provided as requested.

The observer, a Mrs. Cassel, lives in Miles City, Montana, and reports that on the evening of December 15, 1966, she observed a star-like object in the sky which changed color and position. Her description, which is consistent with that of an observation of a planet, would indicate that she probably observed the star-like object in the manner described.

The observer states that the object changed color from white to red to blue, and back to white again. This change in color is consistent with the normal apparent changes in color that can occur with the movement of a planet through the atmosphere. The object also reportedly moved about in the sky, which is again consistent with the apparent motion of a planet as the observer changes position.

When sightings occur, and the observer is looking through the atmosphere, the observer is often seeing the various colors of the spectrum broken up and refracted by the atmosphere. This can give the impression of color changes in the object being observed. The light rays of different colors are bent by the atmosphere to different degrees, causing the color separation.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it would appear that Mrs. Cassel probably observed a planet, possibly Venus, rather than an unidentified flying object. We are then looking through a thicker layer of atmosphere, causing the light rays to be broken up and refracted, giving the impression of color changes in the object.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. We appreciate your cooperation in providing this information.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
