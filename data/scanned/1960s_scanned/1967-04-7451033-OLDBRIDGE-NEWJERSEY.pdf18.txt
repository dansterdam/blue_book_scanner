Report of sighted unidentified flying object

Dear Sir:

Enclosed is a report of a sighting of a UFO which occurred on April 27, 1967 in Oldbridge, New Jersey. The object was observed by several persons, including myself, and was seen for a period of approximately 10 minutes.

The object appeared to hover in the sky and then suddenly accelerate at a high rate of speed and disappear. It was circular in shape and emitted a bright light. We were unable to determine the exact size or distance of the object.

I am submitting this report for your files. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

PS: I shall be interested to learn if any other reports of this nature were received from this area.

If you have any questions, I will be happy to provide a copy.
