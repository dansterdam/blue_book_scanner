The provided image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed letter. I will now proceed to produce all the text found in the document:

Griffith Observatory and Planetarium
P.O. Box 27787
Los Angeles 27, Cal.
Mrs. Leon Hall
Bunkie, La.

In my letter of Sept. 7, I said that the photos
that accompany my report on unidentified objects or
phenomena could be forthcoming. They are enclosed.
By photographic analysis, it was determined that photos
A and A1 in the report were two different printings of
the same negative, so to save some, only the best copy
negative was printed.

I am most interested in your opinion of the
nature of the phenomena that I observed.

Very truly yours,
