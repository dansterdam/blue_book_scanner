There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a form with questions related to the sighting. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    Day    Month    Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
