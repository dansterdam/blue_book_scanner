The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

I wish I could give more details to the light that we have seen mentioning that do not exist. My brother-in-law, a military pilot, appeared to be the normal with real lights in a row at near altitude. Now I did not see this one myself, but he is not the type of person to go about hallucinating. Moreover, it is more or less the size of a person to be about hallucinating.

1951 - 54 1050 sightings have been reported. Everyone have been seen and most have been extremely high. The figure remains of sightings must be extremely high. Several at least 50 people might have been watching, but not reporting.
