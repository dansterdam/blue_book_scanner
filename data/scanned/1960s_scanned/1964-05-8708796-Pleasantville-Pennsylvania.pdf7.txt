Report on telephone conversation with United Presbyterian Church, 
First Street, Pleasantville, Pennsylvania, phone 4-4531, regarding his observation of 26 May 64, phone call was made on 10 May 65.

GENERAL COMMENTS:
1. Object of phone call was to determine if possible, through the conversation, of general reliability and exciteability of observer and to attempt to bring out any inconsistancies and contradictions during the retelling of the story.
2. As stated in the original report the sighting was divided into three phases: Phase One - driving west on route 36-27 in fairly open country, when for three or four seconds they saw a very bright light, so bright, that they almost had to squint at it. He said he was sure it was close by because it was in front of trees that were on the other side of the field. The observer is a young man, who on 1 Jun 65 is being transferred to another parish. The light in the field suddenly went out.
Phase Two: Shortly after this, apparently just a matter of a minute or so, both men saw a clearly defined light but not so bright as the first light, somewhat higher in the sky, higher than the treetops, to their right, definitely circular outlines, but appeared as a reflective light, somewhat larger than the moon. If this was the original light it must have crossed the road. This second phase occurred about 1/2 mile West of the original sighting. During the second phase he got out of the car and saw the actual moon elsewhere in the sky. He stated the second phase lasted 12-15 seconds but agreed that since in this time he had to stop the car, get out, look around and get back into the car and look out the front window the time must have been longer. Here his story is inconsistant.
