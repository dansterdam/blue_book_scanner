IS THERE ANYTHING PECULIAR OR UNUSUAL IN THIS OBSERVATION OTHER THAN THE THING OBSERVED? U
AT THE URGING AND QUESTIONING OF THE INVESTIGATOR, THE WITNESS ATTEMPTED TO GIVE A FULL AND DETAILED ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE OR SHE ACTUALLY SAW. THE INTENT IS TO CAUSE THE WITNESS TO SEARCH HIS OR HER MEMORY TO THE UTMOST AND TO DESCRIBE THE OBSERVATION AS FULLY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT REGARD TO WHAT THE WITNESS THINKS THE OBSERVATION MIGHT MEAN. IN THIS WAY, MANY SMALL BUT IMPORTANT DETAILS OFTEN COME TO LIGHT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE OVERLOOKED OR FORGOTTEN
SO GOD THAT ARE KNOWN TO THINK OF LOOKING OR TO SEE SAY A SIGN WELL IT MAY BE SO THAT SOME OF THESE LITTLE DETAILS THAT ARE AT FIRST OVERLOOKED MAY BE THE VERY CLUES THAT SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF THESE STRANGE PHENOMENA SO I CAUTION YOU AGAIN TO GET EVERY DETAIL NO MATTER HOW SMALL IT MAY SEEM TO BE
ALSO BE VERY CAREFUL AND SPECIFIC IN OBTAINING OR CLARIFYING YOUR INFORMATION. DON'T LEAP TO CONCLUSIONS OR SPECULATE ON WHAT IT IS, BUT STICK TO THE ACTUAL FACTS AS YOU KNOW THEM. QUESTION CLOSELY TO BE SURE OF GETTING ACCURATE ANSWERS. REMEMBER THAT THE WITNESS IS USUALLY GREATLY IMPRESSED AND HIS OR HER RECOLLECTIONS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ENTIRELY ACCURATE. SO GO SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY
