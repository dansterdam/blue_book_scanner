The image does not contain a photograph, but rather it is a page from an old document from Project Blue Book, a former U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

The text reads as follows:

METROPOLITAN ORANGE COUNTY'S WATCHFUL NEWSPAPER
SANTA ANA, ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA SUNDAY SEPTEMBER 26, 1965
  
AIR LAUNCHES FULL PROBE OF COUNTY UFO
By FRANK HALL AND BILL FAIR

Experts are investigating to determine if the aerial object photographed over Santa Ana last Monday's edition was a "flying saucer." 

The captain of the Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official investigative unit, has said the object photographed was an "unidentified flying object" and that a preliminary analysis indicates it may be a "mysterious and unusual aerial phenomenon."

He said initial investigations of the UFO sighting have revealed the object was a "minimum of 15 feet in diameter and 5 feet thick" and was traveling at "an estimated speed of 500 miles per hour."

Three pictures of the "purported flying saucer" taken by Helio Caetano of Santa Ana and the Santa Ana Register, were published in last Monday's edition.
