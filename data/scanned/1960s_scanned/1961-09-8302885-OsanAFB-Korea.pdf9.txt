K. PREPARING OFFICER: LT BRUCE E. SMITH, CHIEF, OPERATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE, 314TH AIR DIVISION. BOTH OBSERVERS STATED THAT THEY
HAD NOT SEEN ANYTHING PRIOR TO SIGHTING. OBJECT WAS NOT SEEN BY
ANY OTHER KNOWN PERSONS. THERE WERE NO UNKNOWN TRACKS ON LOG
RADAR. CHIEF TOWER OPERATOR DID NOT SIGHT OBJECT. NO MISSILE
RANGE OR AERIAL TESTS WERE MADE IN THE AREA DUE TO STORMS.
ESTIMATED BY OBSERVERS AS ABOUT THE SAME AS A LIGHT AIRCRAFT
ALTITUDE. IT WOULD SEEM LIKELY THAT OBJECT COULD HAVE BEEN A
COPTIER. PERHAPS AN UNSCHEDULED MILITARY FLIGHT IN THE AREA. OBSERVERS
HOWEVER DISCOUNTED THIS, AS THERE WERE NO RED LIGHTS VISIBLE. 
THERE WAS NO AUDIBLE SOUND, ALTHOUGH OBJECT WAS VERY CLOSE.
IF LOCATION OF OBJECT UNKNOWN. L. NONE.
