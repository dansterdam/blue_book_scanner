Transcribing the text:

The first heard a noise over heard and I said that sound like deafats at high altitude. The sound died not last over these seconds not heard them three times at about five minutes interval. but by the time we looked up they were not in site. so we could not get a good look at them. we heard them back to look up and not see anything. The could not imagine why we could hear them at such a high altitude, unless it was some form lightweight craft.
