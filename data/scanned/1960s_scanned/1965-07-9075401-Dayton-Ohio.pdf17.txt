FLYING SAUCERS ARE ZIPPING AGAIN

LISBON, (AP) Portugal. -- Unidentified flying objects - usually described as shining in two or more colors and ranging from 30 to 50 feet in diameter - have been seen in the night skies over the northern city of Oporto, Portugal, a reliable source reported today.

The first sight was reported July 1. Since then there have been three other sightings by persons in different parts of the city. The objects reportedly give off a glow and make a slight humming sound.

The night the objects were first seen, a family reported they had seen a flat, circular object with a brilliant white light in the center. It had no visible means of propulsion but moved swiftly. 

On another occasion, a local dentist and his wife reported they had seen a luminous disc-shaped object with a central red light. This object moved at high speed and then suddenly shot straight up out of sight.

The source said the Portuguese air force and the civil authorities were investigating the reports.
