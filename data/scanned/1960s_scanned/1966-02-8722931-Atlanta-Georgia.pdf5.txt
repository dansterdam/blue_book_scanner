MAY 6, 1966

Dear Sir,
On Friday, Feb. 4, 1966, as I was looking into the sky through the windows of the 6th floor apartment, I saw something in the sky. At first I thought it was an airplane, but then it came down very fast and stopped over my house. It hovered there for a while and then it took off very fast towards the East. It left no vapor trail. 
The next day, my brother-in-law called the Dobbins Air Force Base and reported what I had seen. They said in reply that they had no record of anything like that in their files.
I called several radio and TV stations, but they all said they had no information about it.
Please write back and tell me what you think of what I saw. I would be very interested in hearing your opinion. 
On the other sheet of paper is a copy of the letter I sent to the Air Force.
Yours truly,
M. Silson
