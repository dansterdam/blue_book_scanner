Dear Major:

For what this is worth, I pass it on. It refers to the Socorro Case. My daughter's roommate at Jackson College and succeeded in rather frightening the roommate. The girl in question went and told her father, who happens to work for AVCO. "It can't tell you anything about this, but there is no need for you to worry. Just don't give it another thought."

Now either the father know something that AVCO is doing which might have a bearing on this, or he is just simply trying to hush this thing up. In any case, what do we know about what AVCO is doing? Is it at all possible that they posses something which they are testing something like this? It so, how close to Socorro do we know there, and who can we ask? I do know that one of the fellows (his name slips my mind right now - a something-or-other) who was one of the investigators of the big UFO Conference called the National Security Board (the one attended by Robertson) was somehow affiliated with AVCO. If I can remember his name, I might be able to find out something through him. On the other hand, your official channels should have no difficulty with this, particularly if there is nothing to it. If it will take another two weeks.

I hope you managed to get down all the four hamburgers. Tell my to have the RBC Club stock that's child! Can't have our Washington guests thinking we are the great unwashed and the great untutored!

I hope that you can make it to Chicago next month.

Merry Christmas,
