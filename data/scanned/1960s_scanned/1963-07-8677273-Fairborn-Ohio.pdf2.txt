I feel silly reporting this but I have never seen anything like it in my life and I can't explain it. The wife & son also observed this object. It appeared to hover, then suddenly dart upward at a very fast speed. The report stated that it was "early warning" or "intelligence" type activity. When I alerted a friend across the way, we both observed the object (1720) after it had hovered for about 3-5 minutes. It then moved away rapidly toward the east. We continued our phone conversation as long as we were able to observe the object, which was about 1935. 
The size and movement of this object was about the same as the echo and movement of the moon or sun that we see in daylight. We cannot explain the purpose or reason for this activity.
