Chief, Information Services Division
Department of the Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear Major Tacker:

I regret to inform you that the operation of the Air Force UFO information and evaluation service has been unsatisfactory. Several incidents of San Francisco residents sighting unidentified flying objects and believing that they were reporting these sightings to the Air Force have come to my attention.

I suspect that the public confidence in this service has been shaken through the experience of those San Francisco residents. It is my understanding that this service is designed to encourage the public to report UFO sightings, but I fail to see how this purpose can be accomplished if the public confidence is lost.

Also, several requests for information regarding UFO sightings have been made to the San Francisco office of the Air Force for the past several months with little or no results. The public is entitled to this information, and I believe it is the duty of the Air Force to provide it.

The above information will be strictly incorporated. Any cooperation you can extend to remedy this situation will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
