DETAILED ACCOUNT OF UFO SIGHTING: - At approximately 2100 hours on 5/5/68, Mr. James Snider, a 36-year-old resident of Wyoming, Ohio, reported observing a strange aerial object which he could not identify. 

According to Mr. Snider, the object was first sighted at about 3000 feet altitude, approximately 1/2 mile southwest of his residence. He described the object as being circular in shape, approximately 75-100 feet in diameter, and emitting a pulsing red light.

Mr. Snider stated that the object was observed for about 20 minutes, during which time it hovered silently and made several sudden, erratic movements, including a vertical ascent and descent. 

No other witnesses were reported.
