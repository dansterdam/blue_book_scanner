Based on the image, there does not appear to be any photograph present. The image shows a document titled "Request for Radar Information" from the United States Weather Bureau Station in Wichita, Kansas, dated September 3, 1955. The document requests information about specific radar returns that may represent unidentified flying objects.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

TDEW
Request for Radar Information

United States Weather Bureau Station
Wichita, Kansas

Reference the attached 35mm time lapse photos: rolls TCT 65-25 and 65-27 from Wichita, Kansas. Request information as to which specific returns represent unidentified flying objects.
