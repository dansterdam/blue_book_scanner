The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old "Saucer News" publication, which is described as the "OFFICIAL PUBLICATION OF THE SAUCER AND UNEXPLAINED CELESTIAL EVENTS RESEARCH SOCIETY".

Dear Major Hart:

I call your attention to the enclosed newspaper clipping in which, as you can see, the UFO Magazine is NICAP's official publication for an official governmental agency. You will note that the young man who took the alleged saucer photographs in Washington is Sid Raymond, who is our NICAP director in New York. Sid Raymond is, of course, a major in the U.S. Air Force, and because NICAP is located in Washington, these errors are not necessarily NICAP's fault in any way. It would be a good idea if NICAP could be persuaded to publish an H-H' limitation there. Whereas these errors are not necessarily NICAP's fault, it is true that these UFO "fans" around the country who have come to the conclusion that NICAP is officiallyconnected sanctioned or connected with the Government.

Best wishes, as always,
