On the ground, or possibly higher in the air, There were definitely seven open-shaped craft, or possible three times as many, Their spacing would indicate that, if the craft were in fact round, there were probably 15 or 18 of these equally spaced around the craft, I could not judge their exact size but it was definitely of a size which was difficult to give perspective to, I would "guess" they were from 20 to 50 feet in diameter, They did not make any noise that I could detect, The craft hovered motionless for a minute or five minutes, I was so entixed by the sight,

I have been looking for, or two, not stolen, and think undoubtedly stolen, without a trace.
My first reaction, on hearing the cows, was that someone was among them, On see-ing the craft, I remember thinking, "this is very definitely not an airplane or anything I have ever seen before in my life," They are at a possible U.F.O., but rather some monstrous helicopter or other craft,
Some of the cows were milling about that object, and from perhaps 100 to 200 feet away, Cows with younger calves were belling, and some of the calves were sucking, A small stream of water or liquid stream, came from the object about 2 feet of the ground, The object appeared to be hovering, motionless, about 2 or 3 feet over the ground. It remained some little time after the cows departed, but I have no idea whether this constituted the entire observation, It was during this time that I concentrated my attention on the object in question,

All during this time there had been a distinct noise that I have a difficulty in describing, It might whirl around above his head at high speed and yet it had a pulsating rhythm of some kind, When the craft departed, this noise was for or three times louder and more rapid, The craft moved away rapidly, in absolutely straight line, reaching a speed I would say was several thousand miles per hour, leaving a trail behind it,

This experience was over, I had the flashes and felt chilled at the same time, and was perspiring all over, I went back to the bedroom and was surprised that wife had not awakened, The light on the alarm clock that I had not noticed before, indicated it had been gone only about 2 or 3 minutes, apparently no disturbance.

I am 57 years of age, employed as an advertising manager for Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company in Kansas City, Missouri, and in 1965 became a member of the County Planning and Zoning Commission, 2 of which I am chairman and of which I have never related this experience, In the time from the encounter to the County Planning and Zoning Commission meeting, there must have been a time lapse of about 2 or 3 hours, and during that time I had attended that meeting without awakening me, When I returned to the bedroom, after the experience related in the above paragraphs, it must have been past 9:15, I must have been awakened.

More I cannot tell you, I have made no announcement to anyone in the local area, It certainly seems to mysteries or publicity of any kind, It I can be of any assistance to you, please let me know.
