11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted a bright white object that looked like it was on fire, since smoke was coming off of the object. The object seemed to come down very fast. One observer thought it might have been a glider, but they felt it was too fast and that it must have been a UFO. All observers agreed that it looked like a spinning round light. One witness said the object looked like a meteorball. All three observers are not sure what direction the object was heading, nor reports to the sky, enough.
From the information there is nothing present to indicate that the object was more than an airfoil.
