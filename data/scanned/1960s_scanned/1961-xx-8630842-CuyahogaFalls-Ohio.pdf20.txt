LIKE A SPORT LIGHT AND DARKER RANGE WITHIN IT.
ALSO A REDDISH COLOR WHICH FADED IN FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AS IT MOVED. THIS WAS TOLD TO ME BY
MR. AND MRS. RILEY FROM ME. SEVERAL WITNESSES OBSERVED THIS OBJECT WHICH I
HAPPENED TO SEE ALSO PASS OVER HEAD MAKING NO NOISE AT ALL. IT SEEMED TO BE APPROXIMATELY
450 TO 500 FT. HIGH AND MOVING QUITE RAPIDLY TO THE WEST TOWARD AKRON OHIO. IT
WAS ABOUT 9 SEC. LONG AND THE ONLY THING I COULD SEE WAS IT'S TRAIL WHICH SEEMED TO
BE LIKE A THIN THREAD OF SMOKE OR VAPOR TRAIL.
