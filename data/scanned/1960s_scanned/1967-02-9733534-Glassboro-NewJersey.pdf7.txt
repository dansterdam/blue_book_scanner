There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a series of questions and instructions for the observer to fill out.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: 
a. Sound
b. Color
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or small object in line with a known object and not try to determine what angle the object would have subtended if you had performed this experiment at the time of sighting. How much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a sketch that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please be as accurate as possible to show the direction the object was moving.
