April 26, 1966

Dear Sir:

I am wondering if you can give me any further information concerning the strange object that was sighted over Baltimore, Maryland on the evening of March 26, 1966.

I had an opportunity to interview the witness and collect some additional information regarding this incident. The witness states that he first observed the object at approximately 7:00 P.M. while driving along U.S. Route 40 at a point near the Baltimore-Washington Parkway overpass. He describes the object as round or oval in shape, silver or white in color, and estimated it to be about 100 feet in diameter. The object was observed to hover, make abrupt changes in direction, and accelerate at tremendous speeds. The witness claims that the object made a definite "saucer-like" appearance and at times appeared to tilt at an angle. 

The witness further states that he had a good view of the object for approximately 5-10 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. He indicates that there were no other witnesses to this particular incident, although he assumes there may have been others who also saw the object but did not report it.

I would appreciate any additional information or details you could provide regarding this case. I am particularly interested in any evaluations or conclusions reached by Project Blue Book personnel concerning this incident. Please let me know if you require any further information from me.
