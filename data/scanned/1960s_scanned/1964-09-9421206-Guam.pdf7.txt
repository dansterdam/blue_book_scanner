Subj: U.F.O., Sighting of

At GUAM Sept 1964 in a VW-1 Aircraft on a Magnetic Heading of 120 degrees, I observed a sudden pale green flash, lighting up the sky out the Port window of the Cockpit. I was standing between the pilot seat and the time observing along with discussing them with the pilots. My view was somewhat restricted, I leaned to the right, looked out the Starboard window and observed a bright green object, brighter than a meteor, descending object seemed to disappear at 240 degrees true azimuth from the aircraft. approximate direction of fall was 240 degrees true azimuth also, time actually in view was short, however, probably no more than one second.
