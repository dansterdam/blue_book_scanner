Flying Saucer' Reports Spread In New Mexico

Mexico's perennial addition to flying saucer sightings took hold of the state again with more "objects" reported to police over the weekend.

The latest, which brought out the Air Force and the deputy sheriff, was spotted early Saturday morning a few miles west of San Antonio, about 50 miles south of Socorro.

Martin Vigil said, "there was definitely something there."

He told State Police he got within 200 feet of the object during a chase. He said it looked like an egg-shaped butane tank. He said flames spewed intermittently from the bottom of the object. It was as long as a 55-gallon drum and about 14 feet in circumference, he told police.

A similar report comes from a Socorro policeman, Leonce Sanchez, who said the object was also spotted in the same area by several motorists. A campus policeman at the University of Albuquerque, George Wingenbach, said he saw an object holding a stationary position over a mountain in the Sandia Reservoirs area.

La Madera reports the ground in the area where the objects were reported to have landed was scorched and burned. Also found were markings possibly made by the landings, "like small child's print," as well as small drippings from the objects.

Until the recent sightings, the last undisputed flying object was reported over the Clovis airport April 10, where it was observed by several motorists. A campus policeman at the University of Albuquerque reported the Gallup object flying in the western sky at the same time.
