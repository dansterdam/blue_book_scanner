The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text transcribed from the document:

To NASA:

I am taking the liberty of writing you to call your attention to the enclosed photographs taken by a friend of mine on 9/26/60 at around 2 p.m. The shape of the objects was round, about 15 meters in diameter. Photographed with a shutter of 6.5, time 1/250, distance indistinct.

I have addressed myself to your kind courtesy not knowing where else to address myself and/or matter still being under reserve.

Always at your orders for possible clarifications. I ask that you kindly excuse my indiscretion.

Thanking your, I am

Very truly yours,

If this is not within your competence I would appreciate your referring it to the competent authorities. 

Thanking you again, I extend my cordial greetings.

Italia
