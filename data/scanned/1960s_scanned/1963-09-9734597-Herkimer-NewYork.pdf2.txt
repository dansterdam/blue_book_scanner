The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page includes information such as the action number, date, file number, location, and a description of the observed object. The description lists characteristics such as "round", "pea", "red-green (flashing)", and "colored lights". As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have output all the text found in the document:
