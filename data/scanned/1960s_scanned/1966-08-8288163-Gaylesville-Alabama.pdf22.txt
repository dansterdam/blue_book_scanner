The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Assumptions:
(1) Objects (lights) were 500 feet above the level of the road. (My best guess)
(2) Each object was approximately 9.3 feet in diameter. (Based upon: measurement of finger's 3/4 inches from the eye and the estimate that the diameter of the object is the size of the length of the finger nail.) (= 0.5 inch)
(3) Assume three objects formed an equilateral triangle. (All angles = 60°)
(4) Guess from scaled drawing that, sides of triangle are 10 meters.
(5) Assume angle of attack (a) about 30° or so and get height of center light at maximum of about 8 meters.
(6) Assume the "lights" were electronia (electron clouds) and motion unaffected by atmosphere (assume vacuum).
(7) Assume positive charge for three outside lights and negative charge for moving center "object" (light).
(8) Assume dynamic probablity shown to be true only for the dynamic case.
