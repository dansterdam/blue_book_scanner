Gentlemen:
Plfase look into this unusual report, a total of three calls were received at police headquarters in West New York, New Jersey on the night of August 7, 1967, concerning a very unusual and significant sighting of an unidentified aerial object. The reports indicate the object was around 60 to 70 feet in diameter, was very bright and showed a slight reddish glow. It was also reported that there was a hovering sound coming from the object.
My own views and opinion of the matter is that this is a very significant and unexplained event worthy of looking into further. I would suggest that this should be investigated as soon as possible.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if any further information is required.
