The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document. The document appears to be a letter discussing a UFO sighting and regulations regarding UFO reports.

The text of the document is as follows:

airport. This object was moving towards the local air-port. There were gusty, shifting winds and the UFO moved erratically. Also, what made it break up partly.

I've never seen a UFO before, and I have not reported this to anyone else yet.

Last March you answered a letter from me, and said, among other things, "Air Force regulation does not prohibit Air Force personnel from releasing details of unex- plained UPC reports. The air force prohibits the base from issuing premature information on UFO sightings which they cannot solve." To the best of my knowledge paragraph ll reads, "Air Force personnel...will not contact private individuals on UFO cases nor will they discuss..." Was the regulation changed?

Finally, may I have a copy of Blue Book's publication?

Sincerely yours,
