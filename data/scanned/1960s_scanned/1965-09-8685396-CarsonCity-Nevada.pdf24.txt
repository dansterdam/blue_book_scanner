FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
JAN-FEB 66

20 Sep 65
Selsey, England

A Selsey, England, fisherman who wishes to remain anonymous, reported seeing a strange, saucer-shaped object off the coast on September 20.
He said he was out fishing with several others when he noticed a bright, brilliant light in the sky shortly after 9 p.m. The light, he said, was moving across the sky in a northerly direction and gradually became larger and more distinct. 
It was very close, only about 200 yards off the coast, and appeared to be about 40 feet in diameter. The saucer-shaped object had a dome in the center and was a metallic silver color.
The had was immediately behind the object as it passed over the fishermen, but they did not hear any sound from it. 
As it moved away, the light gradually diminished and the object appeared to be glowing. There was no flame or exhaust visible.
The witness said the sighting lasted about 10 minutes. He was greatly interested and excited, he said, and could not account for what he saw.
"I was absolutely amazed," he told investigators. "I thought at first it must be some kind of aircraft, but it was completely silent and moved in a way that no aircraft I have ever seen could move. It was definitely not an airplane or helicopter."
Several other local fishermen who were out at the same time also reportedly saw the strange object.
