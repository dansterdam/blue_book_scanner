The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a scanned document, likely an old Project Blue Book report, that describes an incident involving a reported unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

Like checking with Cambridge and others we can usually do it from here. If we can not explain it we can't explain it. Can't say anything about it. There has been so much publicity, Mr. Heis said, that the police commissionar is intervieving them to make sure they were not drinking. We usually get calls after there is publicity. Mr. Heis said that one of their fellows interviewed the policeman. The patrolman saw it at 5:10 am, and said he knew it wasn't a star and it was very high up. It moved up and to the south, one time very bright then it would dim. He said it moved in a southerly direction. Photographer said it was hard to distinguish between a star, first moved at 7 - 10 deg angle, later at a 45 deg angle. Wanted to know what Major thought about it now. Major said since I/( don't have the information I can't say. I would have to take a look at all the information. I will have to check the weather data. The weather was very clear that night and their were strong breezes on the surface and they let up as the night went on. Wanted to know how soon our office would received the report. Major Quintanilla informed him it would take at least 72 hours before we would get it.
