14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
ALL OF IT

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please do so as well as you can in showing the direction the object was moving.
