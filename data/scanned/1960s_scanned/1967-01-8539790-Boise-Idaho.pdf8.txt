Dear Jim:

Reference your recent observation and subsequent photograph of an unidentified flying object.

Examination revealed the presence of a circular shaped object with some type of protrusion. The initial report stated the object possessed a small degree of illumination along its circumference. The background of the photograph appears dark with no other distinguishing features.

Since there was no indication of size for the object, a scaling factor to size the object was precluded. If the object was traveling at high speed, the witness stated, more degrees of blurring should have been present.

Degrees of blurring observed in the report. At one point, it was stated the object was visible for three or four seconds. The duration for which the object was sighted is stated as 20 to 30 seconds. This discrepancy has not been resolved. There is no evidence in the photograph that the object is extraterrestrial.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
