ATTN OF: OD 29-21-

SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Flying Object, Jeffersonville, Indiana, 14 April 1960. Sighted by: [redacted]

TO: ATIC CAFCU-4E23

1. The following information is reported by this individual:

a. At about 2330 hours on 14 April 1960, while traveling north on Road 31E at Jeffersonville, Indiana, he observed an object in the sky to his right. This object appeared to be a part of the Strategic Air Command Detachment Office of the 8th District Air Force Base, is furnished for your information and any action deemed appropriate.

Dealer: BEAGLE Transmance Company, 1522 North Meridian, Indianapolis, Indiana.

b. At 0144 hours 14 April 1960 he was traveling north on Road 31E at Jeffersonville, Indiana and as he approached the Tunnel Road overpass, he observed the same object on Road 62 he had observed earlier. The object was traveling from his left to right at about 20° to the left of his center of vision and downwards to an elevation of approximately 30° to 35°. It appeared to be moving in a rather flat trajectory and did not seem to have any rotating motion.

c. The object was in a burning condition for the first half of the time it was first sighted. It was then travelling for approximately one-fourth of the total time with flame or burning condition, and after completing another 4 to 5 minutes of the flight, it displayed from the time he first saw the object until it disappeared at about 15 degrees above the horizon.

d. The object seemed to have a length of two to eight times its width, however the leading part reflected changing colors which appeared to be from red to green. This trailing part, although indistinct, may have had a coloring of brownish-red. The object's intensity in light would at times become very bright and then would display any change.

e. Because of its great intensity in light and size, it seemed that the object would have lit up the entire countryside, but the individual stated that it did not seem to interfere with the vision he had from the areas surrounding the object. As the object appeared to come closer to the horizon it light would diminish.
