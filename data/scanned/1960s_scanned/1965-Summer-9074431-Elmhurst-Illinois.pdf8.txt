The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to study unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains two illustrations, one showing a curved line with angles and angles, and another showing a compass-like symbol. There is also handwritten text describing the illustrations and asking questions about the motion and arrangement of objects.

OCR output:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
