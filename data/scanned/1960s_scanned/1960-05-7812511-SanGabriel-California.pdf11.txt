OUR INVESTIGATION OF PAGE 11 OF THE DOCUMENT:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
The witness has drawn a rough sketch depicting the path of the observed object, with an "A" at the beginning and a "B" at the end.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.
The witness estimates the size as "circular about 17 and 22 feet".

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand? (Circle One):
a. Head of a pin  b. Pea  c. Dime  d. Nickel  e. Quarter  f. Half dollar  g. Silver dollar
The witness circled "g. Silver dollar" to indicate the relative size of the observed object.

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22):
a. Very certain  b. Fairly certain  c. Not very sure  d. Uncertain
The witness circled "d. Uncertain" to indicate the level of certainty about the size estimate.

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
The witness describes the object disappearing from view gradually, writing "gradually went out of sight".

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe to your own satisfaction the object which you saw. Give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
The witness provides a detailed description, stating that the object was "round and glowing" with "no obvious openings or projections", and that it would be made of "some kind of transparent glass-like material" about 17-22 feet in diameter.
