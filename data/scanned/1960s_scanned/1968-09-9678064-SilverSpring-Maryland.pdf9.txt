A little over a year ago, the I came across an interesting story about a local glass company in Silver Spring, Maryland that had an unusual experience with a bright saucer shaped object in the sky. The incident occurred at 11:30 a.m. on September 9, 1968 and it was observed by five employees of the glass company. 

The object is described as silver in color, elliptical in shape, with no visible protrusions or appendages. It hovered in the sky for about 3 to 5 minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight. The object did not make any sound and appeared to be metallic in nature. The five witnesses were able to get a good look at the object and one of them even got close enough to estimate its size as being about 30 feet in diameter. 

This incident was reported to the local police and an investigation was subsequently conducted by the US Air Force's Project Blue Book program. The report indicates that the Air Force was unable to provide a conclusive explanation for the sighting, classifying it as "unidentified".
