FLYING SAUCERS OVER ARGENTINA: On the night of November 12th, mysterious disc-shaped objects were observed over the city of San Francisco. These unidentified objects stopped the sky at about 7:15 p.m. and hovered for several minutes - the speed of a man-made earth satellite, according to a spokesman for the Directorate of Meteorology. Here pilot's crew member on an Argentine plane reported that these unidentified objects, either in speed or orbital flight.- Several persons in a truck traveling along a highway near Rosario claimed to have seen a fast-moving brightly-lit object swooped down on their truck several times. These incidents occur just two days in a continuing Argentine flap - some events and witness reports of little men. Unfortunately, our clipping services do not send us more than a small percentage of these reports.
