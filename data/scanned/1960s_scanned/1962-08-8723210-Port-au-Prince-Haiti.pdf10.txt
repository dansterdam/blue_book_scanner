5. At the time of the sighting the bright star alpha virgo (Spica), magnitude 1.0, was only approximately one-half degree from the planet Venus at the same apparent magnitude 3.4. They were both on the horizon and could not be positively distinguished from each other due to atmospheric conditions which was a contributing factor.
6. Venus at the time of the sighting had a magnitude of -3.9. The observer stated that no more than 10 to 15 minutes earlier at 13:34 he had viewed from the warth-nll station Venus as a brilliant star approximately 30 degrees elevation with the unaided eye, and that as time went on it seemed to diminish in brightness. This apparent distortion could have been an atmospheric effect.
7. It is concluded that the misidentification of the planet Venus was probably the major factor contributing to this report. The apparent nearness of the star-like object to the planet Venus, the similarity in magnitude and other atmospheric conditions were probably major contributing factors.
