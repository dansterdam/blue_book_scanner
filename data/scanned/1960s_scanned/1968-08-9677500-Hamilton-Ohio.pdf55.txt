The report states:

"The strange object that was seen that night was observed by two people who were husband and wife, living on a farm outside of Hamilton, Ohio. They reported seeing a bright light in the sky that approached their farm and appeared to land in a field near their house. They went outside to investigate and saw that the light was coming from a large, oval-shaped object that was hovering above the ground. The object was silent and had no visible means of propulsion. It illuminated the surrounding area with a bright, white light. After a few minutes, the object suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view. The witnesses stated that the object seemed to defy the laws of physics and that they were very shaken by the experience. They reported the incident to the local authorities, who in turn forwarded the information to Project Blue Book for investigation."
