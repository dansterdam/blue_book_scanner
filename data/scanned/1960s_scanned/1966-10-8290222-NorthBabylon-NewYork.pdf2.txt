14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It was hovering and then seemed to vanish.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
YES   NO   (Circle One): NO

16. Did the object move in front of anything at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Rattling, humming, buzzing sound
b. Color: White, or maybe a dull gray. Didn't seem too distinct.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
A match would have covered most of the object in the sky.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
