Dear Sirs:

Although, the information is several months past due, I hesitated to write to you office for several months. However, I have decided that I must do so because the information, that I have may be of some value to your research.

It may be difficult because of all the bad publicity that a person seems to get when he states what I do not wish to receive any public notice, and which to remain anonymous and not have my name mentioned or make public at any time, and yet I can call on you without much expense to your office. 

My regular day off from work is Wednesday and Sundays, please notify me at least of either when I may talk with two man with some authority in your area, and the other by station. One, a prominent manager in our area, and the other may station.

I hope that this letter will not be received in any other manner, than that for which it is intended.

Respectfully,
[Signature]
Nederland, Texas
