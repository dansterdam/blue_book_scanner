The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

"flying disc" is about 12 inches in diameter and spinning at a high rate of speed. It appeared to be hovering about 100 feet above the ground in a rural area. Two small creatures approximately 3 feet tall were observed standing near the object before it shot straight up out of sight.
