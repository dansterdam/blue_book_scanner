NO, I think I have. I think if I put you on a torture rack I couldn't get any more information. You've been very cooperative.
Can I get your name and where you are.
Sure, sure, it's a.Hyinek. I'm an astronomer here at Northwestern University and I've been a consultant to the Air Force on Project Bluebook for quite a few years.
You're at Northwestern, and where?
Evanston, Illinois.
Oh, in Evanston. We have a Northwestern University here, or maybe that's just Northwest at Wichita Falls. I'm not sure. Well, I'm very glad to give you any information I can, and if you should come up with anything interesting I would appreciate having a note from you.
All right, then let's make this a two-way street. If you wnated your flying saucer come across anything else, I'd appreciate hearing from you. I'm very easily reached, simply the Dept, of Astronomy, Northwestern University.
Sure, I'd be awfully glad to get in touch.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
