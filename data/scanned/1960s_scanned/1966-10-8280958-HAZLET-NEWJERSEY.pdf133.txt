The kitchen is on the east side of the house from the bedroom. As the kitchen from the bed in the bedroom. One large kitchen window opened. Federal Aviation lights were mounted about 1/2 mile from the window. This lady lay awake in her bed and was startled to become all lit up in a steady blue green colored light. It was as if have been hit a fluorescent lamp turn on. The light filled the bedroom and because of fear she did not leave the bed and go look out the window to awaken her husband and to see what is quite out about this yet. For nearly have been in the light period that lighted up the edge of the ceiling light was in the kitchen floor, as if something outside were moving away. It took an for 1/2 min to go out again. Then in her daughter who was ill got up to go bathroom again to see her kitchen lighted up in the light. And again after minute this period it slowly receded and plunged the floor back in darkness resumed.

Sat - I rechecked her story again today. I am positive she is telling truth do so voluntarily. The radio said I discovered her location around the relay tower and she told her story spontaneously. I can find no sources to explain this. The past light to be if it away and behind you I am.
