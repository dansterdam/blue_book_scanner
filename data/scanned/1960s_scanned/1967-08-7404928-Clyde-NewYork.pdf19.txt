UFO Observation and Photographs

Clyde, New York 14433

1. Reference your correspondence of October 1967 in which you reported your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs. Add to your original information the fact that your original letter and photographs are complete the attached photographic data sheet and PID Form 164 and return them with your photographs if you care to complete this matter.

2. In the future, if you should observe another unidentified flying object, please report it to the nearest USAF force installation, for they are in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

JAMES C. MANATT, Colonel, USAF
