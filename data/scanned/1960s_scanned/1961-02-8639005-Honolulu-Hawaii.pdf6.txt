The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s and 1960s.

The text of the document is as follows:

OBSERVATORIO ASTRONOMICO PRIVATO 
(PIAZZA DEL CAPITANO, 16 
VOLTERRA - ITALIA)

CABLE ADDRESS: OMITACK

Operation Section 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
1520 H Street N.W. 
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sir,
I have observed an unidentified object that may be the balloon 
that today's newspapers say has been launched from Wallops Island base. 

DATE: 1960 February 16
TIME: (U.T.) 15 43*
COORDINATES: N.A. 43* 40" approx.
EAST + 31* approx.
MOTION: slow 
DIRECTION: from EAST-NORTH EAST to WEST-SOUTH WEST
MAGNITUDE: + 4*

It cannot be the satellite Sona I because in these days this satellite is well observed in the evening going in opposite direction. 
I am sorry I am not in a position to give you further informations, but during this observation I was operating with a telescope photographing.

Sincerely,
Dr. G. Daiiolino
