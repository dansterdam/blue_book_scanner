There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

October 17, 1967

Dear [redacted],

It was most gratifying to get your letter yesterday and to know that you had found out what you had really seen.

No, now that you have identified your UFO, you will not need to send the questionnaire to Wright-Patterson AFB; we will let them know you are not going to.

And incidentally, we do not think you are a great big idiot just remember that the only people who do not make mistakes are those who lack intelligence and the ability to observe the world around them. It takes a really big person to admit that he has made a mistake.

Thank you for letting us know what you saw.

Sincerely,

Civil Branch
