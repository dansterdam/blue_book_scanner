TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT:

One official said -I would say that the sighting in itself is somewhat difficult to explain, if true. I do not think it is a secret weapon. I think what we saw was something that is not known, and that is what I think about the whole thing. I can't explain it. I can't explain the phenomenon.
One officer said -I am convinced that what I saw was no secret weapon or any type of aerial vehicle known to me. As nearly as I can reconstruct, this thing appeared to be above 25,000 feet altitude, and was traveling at a phenomenal speed, somewhere around 1,800 mph. It changed direction almost instantly, which is quite amazing as no known craft can turn that sharp and maintain its speed. During the periods I observed it, it would accelerate then stop, then accelerate again and perform maneuvers which are completely foreign to my experience and knowledge of aerospace capability as of this date.
