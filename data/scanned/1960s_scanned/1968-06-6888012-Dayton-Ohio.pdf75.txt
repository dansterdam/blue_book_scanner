The provided image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten response to a report form. The form appears to be part of the Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the handwritten response states:

"Duuould 3.3y a baby moon hub cap, but larger in size - noticable but did not reflect light on the climb."

This appears to be the witness's description of the observed object.
