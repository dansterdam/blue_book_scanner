There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

TO:	TD-E (Major Friend)

The following, extracted from Capt Fisher's Report dated 13 Sep 61, is quoted for your information:

About 2120 hours, received UFO telephone call from Mrs ___ (deleted). She informed that she had seen high flying objects (similar to the stars) and wanted to know if it was a UFO. I informed her that though it could have been a UFO, I would still need to take further information to call her back so later but did not have time to get information from her. I told her someone would still have to call her back.
