MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJ: UFO Reporter 27 May 1957
On 23 Sep 67, Dr. J. Allen Hynek and 2nd Lt Marano spoke with Mrs. Kirksville, Missouri, regarding her unidentified observation, 27 May 67. Mrs. Kirksville said she was too interested in the observation since at first it looked like it could be the Moon, although it didn't look as round as usual, looked a little pear shaped on top. There was a dark streak across it but that could have been a cloud. The object was higher than any surrounding building. Dr. Hynek asked Mrs. Kirksville if she also observed the moon in addition to this object. Mrs. Kirksville replied no but the object she saw was about as bright as what the moon gets, but yet the object looked larger than the moon. Mrs. Kirksville was looking through a window on the southeast on the second floor. The object was really something in the sky with a dark streak across it, two inches wide, that was probably a cloud going over it. Dr. Hynek asked Mrs. Kirksville if she observed the people in the object. Mrs. Kirksville replied that she did not observe any people or things on the object, that the other lady had seen them but she nor the intern could see the people in the object. Out of the window you can look see or up, the object appeared in the southeast. The object had disappeared about an hour later when they went back to see if it was still there. Mrs. Kirksville said she did not see the moon. Dr. Hynek asked her if it was possible that this object was the moon. Mrs. Kirksville said, yes it was since that is what she thought it was at first, yes it could be the moon.
