MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE
Attn: Lt Colonel T. R. Johnson, AFOIN-X

SUBJECT: (Uncld) UFO Movie

1. The following statements concerning two of the UFO sightings described in the recently released Air Force report, dated 5 May 1956, are submitted in response to a request of 29 May 1956.

a. The Marianna Case - Montana - 1950. The original Air Force evaluation of the data, as well as that of the later independent analysis, was that the UFOs were, in all probability, some Air Force F-84 fighter aircraft known to be in the vicinity at the time.

b. The Newhouse Case - Utah - 1952. The original film was analyzed by an Air Force Photo Reconnaissance Laboratory shortly after the sightings. The conclusion reached was that a number of bright spots on the film were caused by seagulls soaring in thermal air currents. The credibility of the conclusion was undoubtedly supported by the presence of identifiable seagulls in some of the frames.

This conclusion was further strengthened by movies of seagulls, taken at various distances, which showed them as bright spots of light similar to those in the Newhouse film.
