There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an official U.S. Air Force document related to UFO reports, containing a sketch and some questions for the viewer.

Now, as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

Official U.S. Air Force

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass when you first saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.  

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
