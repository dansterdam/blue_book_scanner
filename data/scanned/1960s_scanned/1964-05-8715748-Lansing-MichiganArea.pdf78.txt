ABOUT 3:30 HILLS TWO SAUCER, WAS POINTED CIRCLE OF VISIBILITY, 20 DEGREES TO ACCOUNT BY SAKING OR PARTIAL VISIBILITY, THROUGH THE GROUND RATHER THAN LESS THAN VISIBLE. THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED VERY STEADY TO HIS AND 30-75 MILS ON BIGHT. THIS APPEARED BID BID ON THE BRIGHT OF WAS AND THREE SMALL STARS THAT WAS PUT, WHERE AROUND AND HAD A CONTINUOUS LINE OF LIGHT, THE OBJECTS WOULD BE ALMOST GONE AFTER THE BRIGHT. THE OBJECT MET DISAPPEAR WENT TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND THE OBJECTS EXTENDED AWAY, SEE OBJECT ONE MINUTE. TO BE SWEPT NEAR THE HORIZON. THE DIRECTION WAS THE SAME (MORE OR LESS SUDDENLY) TO THE NORTH PASS. THE DIRECTION WAS LESS THAN SUDDENLY APPEARED MORE THAN 5 TO 6 DEGREES. IT WAS STILL METALLIC, AND ITS SHAPE WOULD BE SUCH AS MANY, ALTHOUGH IT WAS SMALLER IN APPARENT SIZE.

THERE WERE TWO OBJECTS CLEARLY ON THE SECOND PASS. WHEN SPREAD IN DESCRIBING IT AS ROUND (CALLIPENTAGONAL) WHICH LIKE APPAARING ABOUT ITS EDGE, ONE OF WHICH WAS (ACCORDING TO THEM). UNTIL, THE SCHEDULED BEING A STEADY STRAIGHT ALONG WERE DESCRIBED BY A BRIGHT LIGHTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY OBSERVERS AS GOING ON AND OFF LIKE CHRISTMAS-TREE LIGHTS, AND AS STEADY STEADY BY THE.

PASS. THESE WITNESSES DESCRIBED THE BULK OF THE OBJECT AS HAVING VITH A SINGLE MILLION LONG MR. REVEALED DISTINCTLY THAT THE COLOR WAS A PALE RED, AND SEEMED A VERY BLIGHT WHAT TO MUCH ON IT'S SURFACE IT'S SPEED WAS CONSIDERABLE UPWARDS LIKELY THIRTY MILES AS THE EDGE OF THEIR HOUSE SHOWED. HIS SKETCH IS SHOWN AS FIG. B.

ON BOTH PASSES, THE OBJECT SHOWED AN ELLIPTICAL APPARENT SHAPE, AS IF THE OBJECT ROTPED OVERHEAD. WITNESSES STATED THAT THIS OBJECT DEFINITELY WAS NOT A HELICOPTER, AS IT MADE NO SOUND.

AT NATIONAL GUARD IT IS UNKNOWN THAT A FEW TIMES TWO SUCH OBJECT PASS.
