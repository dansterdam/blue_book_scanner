Textual output from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
MAY HAVE BECOME BLOCKED IN REAR OF HOUSE, OR I MIGHT HAVE HAD ANOTHER 5-10 SECONDS SIGHTING BEFORE THEY DISAPPEARED ON OTHER SIDE OF HILL.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes  NO  DON'T KNOW.  If you answered YES, then tell what:
IT MOVED BEHIND.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): YES  NO  DON'T KNOW.  If you answered YES, then tell what:
ONLY OBJECTS I NOTICED BEING PASSED IN FRONT OF WERE SOME DARK OBJECTS CUT THAT NIGHT.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Size: ALL LIGHTS SEEMED MUCH LARGER THAN CHIR'ING NOISE AT FIRST VISIBLE.
b. Color: PALE WHITE AND DULL, ALMOST GREY LUMINOUS.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how many times this is covered by the speed of the object. If you hold your hand in this manner, tell how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
SHOULD ESTIMATE THAT TWO TO THREE-QUARTERS OF OBJECTS WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED. (EACH OBJECT AT A TIME).

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.
