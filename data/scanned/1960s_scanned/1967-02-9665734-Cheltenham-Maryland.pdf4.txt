There is no photograph present in this image from the Project Blue Book report. The image appears to be a page from the report containing a series of questions and answer choices related to the observation of an unidentified object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes - It seemed to go straight up and disappear into the clouds.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes - No - Don't Know 
If you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes - No - Don't Know
If you answered YES, then tell what: In front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Looked at it - no sound.
b. Color: white.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The object was 1/10 the size of a match head against the sky.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object's size, proportions, etc. and especially relative size or vapor trails.
A hand drawn sketch depicts a roughly circular object.

Place an "X" beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
