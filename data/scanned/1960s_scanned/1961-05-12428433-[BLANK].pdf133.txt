PROJECT MERCURY - SECOND INTERIM REPORT
INTRODUCTION
The Honorable Overton Brooks, Chairman of the Committee on 
Science and Astronautics, submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives the First Interim Report on Project Mercury dated January 27, 1960. All most 1 1/2 years have passed since the issuance of that report. This committee report described the goals, the research and development program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for the Astronauts. The purpose of this report is to submit for the consideration of the Congress and the public a report on the tremendous complexity of putting a man into Earth orbit, sustaining his life in a space environment and recovering him safely.
Since its inception, both the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Department of Defense have mapped out more comprehensive stated goals - both for project Mercury and future space booster vehicles - such as Saturn, Titan II, Atlas 6, or perhaps a newly designed liquid and Solids boosters, upon as yet unknown future requirements. Project Mercury is expected to provide answers which must be obtained concerning manned space flight environment, and many useful functions in orbit for 6 to 9 years. Project Mercury is expected to provide the ground work to future programs - answers which must be obtained concerning manned space flight environment.
Consequently, Project Mercury is being prosecuted by NASA under the leadership of the President of the United States. It carries the highest priority rating. Project Mercury represents the first phase of space flight. It is sure to appear as only a beginning when compared to the future goal of achieving and developing capabilities for the exploration of the Moon and planets. Both have experienced controversial criticism on the one hand and determination for achievement on the other hand.
