Dear Sirs - 
I have been interested in UFO's and have been writing to you for sone time, and I hope you can give me some information.
The moon was full last night and I noticed a peculiar light hovering over my house about 6 pm. At first it appeared to be a bright star, but as I watched it I could see the object was hovering and moving in irregular movements.
I called my father to come and look at it and he too was amazed at the peculiar movements of the object.
After about 30 minutes, the light appear to be going into the distance and got smaller and smaller until it disappeared. I hope you can give me some information on this incident, as I find it quite interesting.
Thank you for any information you can give me.
Sincerely,
