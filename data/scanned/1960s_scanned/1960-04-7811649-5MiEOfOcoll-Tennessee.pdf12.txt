Dear Sir:

Attached are my thoughts on the sighting of fact about two balls of light sighted by a civilian in the Tullahoma area.

As you know a team of two NICAP members have thoroughly investigated the incident and their findings in the main substantiate the attached report.

I almost hesitate to contact you inasmuch as I believe we watched as long as the citizen did and some of the things observed speak for themselves. Namely, the manner in which the two lights reacted to one another and the way they hovered, moved about and finally disappeared into the distance almost straight up. The speed at which they moved and the fact that no sound was associated with their actions are some of the significant factors which in my opinion identify this as an unexplained aerial phenomenon.

It is my opinion, and I feel that the NICAP team would concur, that the incident merits further investigation, perhaps even the attention of your office itself.

If you have any questions or require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kindest regards.
