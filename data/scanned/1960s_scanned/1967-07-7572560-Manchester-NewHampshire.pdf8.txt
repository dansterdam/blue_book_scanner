CORRESPONDENCE

TO: Prof. Blue Book FROM: J. A. Hynek
DEPT.: DEPT.: 
DATE: June 1, 1965

A review of sighting reports indicates that the report under case No. 287,550/67 is apparently a multiple-witness sighting of what was reported as an unidentified flying object.

Considerable correspondence has been received on this sighting, and it is recommended that an investigator be assigned to look into this further. A detailed study of the evidence seems to be warranted, as the reports indicate that the sighting was made by a number of reliable witnesses.

So - please advise me as to the recommendation in this case.

J. A. Hynek
