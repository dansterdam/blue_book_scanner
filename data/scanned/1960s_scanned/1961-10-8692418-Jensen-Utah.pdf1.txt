11. COMMENTS: An investigation was present at approximate site of sighting. Although the observer reported seeing superior images of distant mountain peaks which could be a mirage. Noting other facts, the conclusion remains that this was likely unidentifiable movement, time geometry would remain constant and initial sighting may support some aerial phenomena consistent with previous sightings similar to that of Kenneth Arnold which occurred in June of 1947.
