REPORT

On 3 September 1965, at approximately 2300 hours, a young married couple was driving south on Route 101 in Exeter, New Hampshire. As they approached the intersection of Route 101 with Hampton Road, they observed an unusual light in the sky to the north of their position. The light appeared to be very large, brightly illuminated, and was moving slowly in a west to east direction at an altitude estimated to be about 1,000 feet.

The witnesses stated that the object appeared to be circular or elliptical in shape and was surrounded by a glowing, white, hazy aura. As the object moved across the sky, it appeared to occasionally increase or decrease in brightness. The witnesses observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared from view to the east.

After the object disappeared, the witnesses continued driving and shortly thereafter, they noticed that the automobile engine was malfunctioning. The engine was running very rough and the headlights were dimming. The witnesses were able to pull the car off the road and the engine returned to normal operation within a few minutes.

The witnesses provided a detailed description of the object and their observations to the Exeter Police Department. An investigation was conducted, but no satisfactory explanation for the sighting was determined.
