STAFF MESSAGE BRANCH
INCOMING MESSAGE

AF IN: 10707 (8 Sept 66)	Pg 5 of 6

THAT THE BALLOON HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE AREA APPROXIMATELY 10 DAYS, 
THAT THE ALTITUDE VARIES BETWEEN 40 AND 69 THOUSAND FT. THAT THE
DIAMETER IS APPROXIMATELY 500 FT AND THE KBOKA RADIO STATION IN
KENNETT, MO, HAD REPORTED A WEATHER BALLOON IN THE AREA.
PARA TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, 9TH BAMLEMENT WING
BLYTHEVILLE AFB, ARKANSAS.
PAGE 5 RUKGHU 1317 UNCLAS

THE MOST LOGICAL EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSE OF THIS SIGHTING IS THAT 
THE OBSERVER SAW THE LARGE WEATHER BALLOON WHICH REPORTEDLY HAS BEEN
DRIFTING IN THE AREA FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 DAYS. SEVERAL OFFICERS
HAVE REPORTED SEEING THE BALLOON, THE 8-52 WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDER
OBSERVATION FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME REPORTED BY THE OBSERVER AND
UNQUESTIONABLY WAS TOO FAR AWAY AND TOO HIGH TO BE OBSERVED. PARTICULARLY
IN VIEW OF THE LATE AFTERNOON TIME OF OBSERVATION. IT WILL BE NOTED
THAT THE OBSERVER REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED AT
APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES BEFORE SUNSET AND WAS IN VIEW FOR 
APPROXIMATELY ONE AND ONE-HALF HOURS BUT DISAPPEARED WHEN THE SUN
WENT DOWN. THIS APPARENT DISCREPANCY MIGHT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE
FACT THAT EMINENCE, MO, IS ON DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME OR BY POSSIBLE
ERRORS IN THE OBSERVER'S ESTIMATE OF THE TIME OF DAY, BUT THE 
OBSERVATION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF A WEATHER BALLOON.
