35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered or a negative explanation of your sighting:

At the time which the objects were about to leave an airport (it sounded like a double engine plane arrived) with what sounded like a heavy object dropped, the only thing that I could be sure of was the direction from which the objects came - the east. The information which I wish to make additional regarding this is that the objects changed direction as soon as they were sighted and flew up and down as well as anyone on airport. The objects could not be seen for very long, perhaps a minute and a half, and they seemed to be descending toward the ground in a single and slow movement. Their flight pattern could be described as a zig-zag up and down, but it was not at all straight. I am very sure of (3000 ft.) there was a unusual activity which I am unable to describe clearly. This is what I saw distinctly form the objects themselves.
Anyone who might have seen the objects would well agree that they were not jets or any such object which travel at great speed. This may be that they seem to have some sort or either either lighter or stronger than air propulsion because the objects seemed to have just stopped suddenly and changed their course to another direction by having in a most unusual-shaped maneuver.

Would you please give me your analysis of this sighting?
