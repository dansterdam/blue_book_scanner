No Case (Information Only)             19 February 1961
Berlin Heights, Ohio

On February 19th a strange missile hit a house near Berlin Heights, Ohio and did such damage that it broke a number of panes on the roof before falling to the ground. When the owners of the house observed the object land they found several pieces of translucent rock. The top layer resembles limestone, and the lower layers appear to be of a different type of crystalline structure. The object was quite hot when it landed and the lower layers cooled quickly, forming a hard crust. The interior layers cool more slowly and are still in a semi-molten state. This is presently being analyzed by intense heat treatment.
