NICAP MASS SUBCOM UFO REPORT # 65-26 (continued)
Sheet 3

c. The fact that it seemed to "disappear" when it approached the tree-line in the encounter. No attempt was made to identify the object, nor was the object said to give off any distinguishing sounds, smells, or any other indicia other than its apparent behavior.

d. These balloons have exhibited erratic motions due to wind and internal temperature changes.

2. Case Summary 
a. Size at arms-length would have had to be grossly exaggerated if object were in reality a 3-4 foot Gorment Bag Balloon.
b. The object was always moving against the wind.
c. The up-and-down motion and the "descending 'loon'" descent are typical UFO characteristics. 
d. The object appeared highly luminous and had a secondary light seemingly emanating from the object, and the sound heard has been reported in association with other UFO sightings.
e. Garment Bag reports in our files usually describe either small orange lights or dark objects with small orange lights. However, this light was close enough to be well defined and would appear larger.
f. Pointed-top and rounded bottom have been characteristics of other UFO sightings although but I do not remember those characteristics described as singular (to) this incident. 

B. Harm to witness
1. Face - No one close reported the UFO and cars went by when it was crossing the road.
2. Case - Occupants in the car may just not have noticed object or noticed it but did not want to report it. Also, there is no apparent motive or personal indication of a hoax by the witness.

C. Psychological Illusion
