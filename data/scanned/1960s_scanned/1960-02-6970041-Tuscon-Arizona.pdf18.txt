Transcribing the text:

The young man thought a bit than said "Lets go up on the hill and watch it come in; I think it will be back." We proceeded up the hill and took up a position to watch for the return of the object. After about 15 minutes we saw the object coming in from the southeast at an approximate altitude of about 1000 feet. It appeared to be round and glowing with a bluish-greenish light. As it approached our position it slowed down and hovered for several minutes directly over us at an altitude estimated at about 500 feet. 
The object made no sound at all and was quite large, possibly 30 to 40 feet in diameter. After hovering for several minutes it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared out of sight to the northwest. We waited for some time but the object did not return.
