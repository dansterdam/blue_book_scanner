There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document that contains a questionnaire with various questions and handwritten responses.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Lost on the horizon

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud? 
Yes

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
No

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Changed shape as it moved
b. Color - White, glowing, changing

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and estimate how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Yes - About average comparison

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially indicate trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
