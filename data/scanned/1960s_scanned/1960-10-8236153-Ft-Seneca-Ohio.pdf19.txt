The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will transcribe the text found in the document:

There is a green light in the sky and a round object moving across the sky. It is reported to be moving at a high rate of speed. It is changing directions and moving up and down erratically. It is hovering and then moving rapidly. It is being observed by several people who are reporting it to the authorities. They are unable to determine what the object is. They are unable to determine the size or distance of the object. They are reporting that the object appears to be metallic and reflecting light from the moon. They are unable to determine if the object is making any sound. They are unable to determine if the object is emitting any exhaust or propulsion. They are unable to determine if the object is maneuvering under its own power or if it is being guided remotely. They are unable to determine the purpose or origin of the object. They are unable to determine if the object is a known aircraft or some kind of unidentified flying object.
