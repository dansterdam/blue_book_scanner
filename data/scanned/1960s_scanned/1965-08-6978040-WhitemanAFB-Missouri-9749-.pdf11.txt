SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, Whiteman AFB, Missouri
1. On 6 August 1965, at approximately 2325 hours, the Whiteman Air Force Base (AFB) security police received a call from a military member stationed at Whiteman AFB who reported sighting an unidentified flying object (UFO).
2. The witness stated that he had been driving his automobile on a perimeter road at the base when he observed a bright light in the sky near the southeast horizon. He stopped his vehicle and observed the object for several minutes. The witness described the object as round, stationary, and hovering approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. He stated the object was illuminated with a bright, bluish-white light which pulsated periodically.
3. The witness contacted the Whiteman AFB security police, who dispatched a patrol car to the area to investigate. The patrol car arrived at the scene within minutes, and the security police officer also observed the unidentified object. The officer stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape, was illuminated with a bright, bluish-white light, and was hovering approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.
4. After observing the object for several minutes, it suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view to the south. The entire incident lasted approximately 10 minutes. A check of the area revealed no other witnesses to the incident.
5. Project Blue Book has been informed of this incident.
