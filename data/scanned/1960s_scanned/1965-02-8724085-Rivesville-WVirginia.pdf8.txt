There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image seems to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

On 20 February 1965, I received a UFO sighting report from the Waterhill Intelligence Agency, which had received the information from the above witnesses. The agency stated that the sighting occurred at approximately 8:10 PM EST in the Covington, Massachusetts area.

SIGHTING:
The witnesses stated that they observed an object that was larger than a normal aircraft, round in shape, gray in color, and emitting a bright light from the bottom. The object hovered for several minutes and then departed at a high rate of speed. They were certain that what they saw was not a conventional aircraft.
