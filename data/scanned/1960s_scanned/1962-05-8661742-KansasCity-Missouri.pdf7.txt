Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document:

this could only be either a hoax or a real sighting, by one or several observers, of some unidentified object or phenomenon in the sky. There are a number of possibilities, but without more conclusive evidence, the Identfication of such objects or phenomena must remain, for the present, in the realm of conjecture, rather than in the domain of established fact. There is no evidence in the report which would serve to establish the reality of what was observed, or to identify the nature of the objects or phenomena seen. The report, therefore, must be classified as an "unidentified" case, pending the acquisition of additional information which might serve to identify or clarify the nature of the observations.
