Dear Sirs,

My name is going for a recreation at Millacoma, Oregon. At approximately 9:15 Pacific daylight time two of my friends and I were walking home from a friend's house. We came to the youngest bridge and one looked up and noticed the oddest of two, and I looked, we saw a slight red object moving across the sky from east to west at a tremendous speed and then suddenly a nose came onto it and then as fast as it started it disappeared. I raced in at that time to write the TRUE report on flying saucers. I need in on it that if you can or a have ever seen a U.F.O. to write to the address.
