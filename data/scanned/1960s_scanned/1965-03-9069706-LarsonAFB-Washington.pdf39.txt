Gentlemen:

I wish to express my appreciation to the Air Force personnel from McDill AFB, Florida, who investigated the UFO sighting by myself and others at Brooksville, Florida.

The two pieces of material on which there were writings of over to the gentlemen from McDill AFB are being returned herewith. I understand some description was made of the scene that was turned over to the gentlemen, and I was very interested in the contents of what I understood to be returned to me. Your cooperation in this matter will be appreciated.

Yours very truly,

Witness:
