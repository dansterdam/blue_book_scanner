UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
Flower and Cook Observatory 
1968 Feb. 23

Dear Major Quintanilla:

In reply to your letter of Feb. 19 which concerned an observation report of Feb. 23, I wish to inform you that we examined the report carefully and found that no fireball was reported on that night to this observatory.  This means little to us, undoubtedly, since we receive many reports only of small persons or those which are likely to be dismissed as ordinary meteors.

The report in question was sent to us to examine, as explained to you before, and no fireball was reported on that night.  Your cooperation in sending us this report is very much appreciated and helpful.

Sincerely yours,

C. P. OLIVIER
Associate Director
