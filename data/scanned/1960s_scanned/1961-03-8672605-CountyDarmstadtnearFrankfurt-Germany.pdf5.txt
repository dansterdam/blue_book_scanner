The image does not contain any photograph, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the output of the text found in the document:

and it started to move faster and faster. then it moved faster and faster until it went out of sight. the object appeared to be round, a bright light in the center, and it was moving erratically, up and down and to the side. then it arranged to a white bulky object. this happened very fast, then it moved slowly down and disappeared. a human being could never have made the object recorded. so therefore i assume it could have come from another planet or solar system which is very fantastic to believe.
