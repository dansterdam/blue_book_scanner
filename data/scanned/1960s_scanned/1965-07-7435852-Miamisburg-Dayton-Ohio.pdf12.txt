Miamisburg
This morning a see something out of a window. It was moving and it speed about 1000 miles an hour. It remained in sight for a few seconds. I could not get a picture of it as a flash came on.

This second part is scratched out and barely legible, but it appears to say:
"Very seldom anything is seen."

Apparent to move them all up as rapid to appear as a light.
Appeared to plove them and so rapid then been to point back.
It several times circled little up and around then came on brightly.
At 4:50 insignificant then came again when it passed from.
About time went very some bye.
