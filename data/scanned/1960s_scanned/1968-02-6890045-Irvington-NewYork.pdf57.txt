The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document describing a project involving the launch of payloads on Nike-Apache research rockets. The payloads included vapor trails that formed pale green and blue clouds, which were less visible than the sodium. The rockets were equipped with instrumentation to observe airglow in sunlight and measure electron energy distribution. The launches were conducted in cooperation with the GCA Corporation in Bedford, Massachusetts, under contract to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The Wallops Station Project Engineer, William T. Burns, was responsible for coordinating pre-launch, launch, and tracking operations.

along the East Coast. The other five payloads consisted of TEB (first one) and TMA (the next four) vapor trails which formed pale green and blue clouds, less visible than the sodium.

The payloads were flown on Nike-Apache research rockets and the vapor trails were ejected at altitude ranges of about 50 to 90 miles. Data on wind conditions were obtained by photographing the motion of the trails from five camera sites within a 100-mile radius of Wallops Island.

The first rocket was equipped with a photometer for observing airglow in sunlight above the dark earth to get a vertical profile (or chart) of atomic oxygen. The five other payloads carried Langmuir probes for measuring electron energy distribution.

The launchings were conducted in cooperation with the GCA Corporation, Bedford, Mass., under contract to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. William T. Burns was the Wallops Station Project Engineer, responsible for coordinating pre-launch, launch, and tracking operations.
