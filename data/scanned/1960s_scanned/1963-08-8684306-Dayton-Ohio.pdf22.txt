More news from the 
Black Country

The Wolverhampton Express and Star reports that hundreds of people have seen strange objects in the sky during recent weeks. One of them, a young woman who remains anonymous, said she saw "a silvery, egg-shaped object hovering over the Black Country one night" this week. According to the witness, the object had no wings or other visible means of propulsion, and it moved quickly and silently before disappearing.

Another similar sighting was reported by a man who was looking towards the east when he saw a brightly lit object dropping slowly over some trees. He watched it for several minutes before it suddenly streaked away at tremendous speed.

The Walsall police also received numerous reports of strange objects being seen moving high above the town. The air raid sirens were even sounded at one stage, but no aircraft could be identified.

On Saturday night, residents of Wednesfield, near Wolverhampton, watched a large object hovering in the sky for about fifteen minutes. It was described as being "much larger than a star" and had a bright glow. Several people said the object appeared to be spinning, or oscillating, and they heard a faint humming noise.
