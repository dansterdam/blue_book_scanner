Free of soot at least at the time of the comparison. The stones in the original patch each had a slightly raised rim of bright tar around the edges, as if molten tar had been blown up around the stones; the stones in the gasoline test, if they remained visible above the tar, showed no such raised-rim effects. The test areas were burned the most in the upward direction, the pooling of tar being greatest there; the original patch was essentially uniform over all its area.

There were, in other words, noticeable differences between the original patch and the results of the burn-test. It is possible to interpret the original patch as being the result of a high-temperature blasts directed downward, playing over the surface of the road for a short time. The raised rims of tar around the stones suggest that the tar became more liquid than the stones, owing perhaps to its black color and the generally lighter color of the stones. In the gasoline test the stones quickly acquired a coating of soot and were black as or blacker than the tar before the fire went out. The fire survived only a few seconds after extinguishment of the gasoline; the rapid dying out of the flames noted by Grover could mean that a much smaller quantity of flammable fluid was used (if a hose was involved) or else that the tar was ignited strictly by a rise in its temperature, no foreign substances being involved.
