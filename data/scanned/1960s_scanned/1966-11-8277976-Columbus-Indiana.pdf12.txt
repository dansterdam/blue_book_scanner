There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document that appears to be a questionnaire or report related to a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 12 - 22 - 66
33. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

For several weeks early in the evening (6:30 to 8:00) I have noticed some strange lights in the sky. These lights appear and disappear without any pattern or control. They are white or whitish lights and move about rather erratic. I began to notice that every time I would look in that direction, the lights would be there. On some occasions there would be two or three lights at a time. Most of the time the lights were rather high up and would move about with no apparent control and would disappear rather suddenly.

As I said, the small lights go out at the same time and then come back on in a few seconds. Once or twice there was a larger light, but it went out in the same manner as the small ones.

For two or three nights I sat and watched these lights with binoculars. They were some distance away, possibly 15 or 20 miles from here. Once I thought I detected a slight humming sound, but the lights have made no other sound. 

Or was it my imagination about the humming sound?

What could those be and why do they disappear and come back so quickly? I am interested to know if others have seen the same thing. Perhaps any information about the sighting that I can add would be helpful.
