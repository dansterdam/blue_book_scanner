I'm trying to get an answer to an incident that occurred on 27 August 1966. What I saw was a bright light in the sky which appeared to be approximately 50 to 60 feet in diameter. As it came closer, it seemed to be a solid object and what seemed to be a door opened on the side. I can say that for a few minutes it was quite close and then it disappeared. What I'm asking is if there is any information on record about this incident. I would like to know if anyone else has reported seeing anything similar in this area. I realize that I may sound as though I'm imagining things, but I can assure you that what I saw was very real. I would appreciate any information you could give me on this subject. You can contact me at the above address. Thank you for your consideration in this matter.
