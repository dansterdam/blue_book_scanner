The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" point and a "B" point, which are meant to indicate how high an object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it, and how high it was when the observer lost sight of it. The second sketch shows a larger drawing with an "A" point and a person standing on a road.

Here is the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
