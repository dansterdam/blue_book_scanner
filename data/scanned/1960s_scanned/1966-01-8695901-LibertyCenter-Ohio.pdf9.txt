Feb. 25, 1966
Liberty Center, Ohio
Case #: 6-92-59

WITNESS: CLARENCE MILLER

While Marion Dittman and I were talking outside the house, we saw a strange object in the sky. It was about the size of a dime, appeared to be cigar-shaped and of a silver color. It moved very quickly in an up-and-down motion. We observed it for about 5 to 7 minutes. It would disappear and reappear. it moved higher and we lost sight of it in the overcast. We had not heard of any aircraft being in the area. I've observed many aircraft and have never seen anything like this object. It did not have the characteristics of any known aircraft. The object seemed to be intelligently controlled. This was a definite unidentified flying object.
