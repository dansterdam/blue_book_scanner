Great Light Shoots Over
Omaha Area
Two Deputies, W. E. 
Employe Sight It
By Hub Ogden
Blue-white brilliance flashed
across the Omaha sky early
Friday, Dec. 4, as two deputy
sheriffs watched, according to
a W'estern Electric employee.
The deputies patroling on
Rainwood Road south of Rainwood
saw the object about 4:15
a. m., the employee said.
The object moved south on
Rainwood near an intersection
with paved 36th Street. 
Temporary Lane said it
was the brightest of three that
he has seen fall ling stars and it did not appear
to be one.
"I know there would be
more of these about it and
the thing I liked about it
was that it seemed the thing
was falling it I felt pretty good."
He Details From Sergeant Lang:
The light was in the
shape of an elongated leaf, 
The largest forward
end was a brilliant green.
The rear end trailed a
brilliant red-orange tail. 
It slowed down and did
not light up the terrain,
he said.
"It moved in front of
them on a horizontal path,"
Lang said.
