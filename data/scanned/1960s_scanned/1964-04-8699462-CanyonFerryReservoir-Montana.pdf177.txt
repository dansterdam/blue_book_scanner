Transcribing the text from the image:

4 TH AND 8.7 THE UNKNOWN OBJECTS DID WHAT?: ACCORDING TO THE RANKLIN WITNESSES, AS THEY HAVE H CRUDED DESCRIBED IT, THE OBJECT HOVERED AND SWAYED FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR SOME TIME, THEN SUDDENLY DISCHARGED A BRILLIANT BLUE-WHITE BEAM OF LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO STRIKE THE WATER OF THE CANYON FERRY RESERVOIR. AT THE END OF THIS BEAM WAS A DISTINCTIVE ORANGE COLORED LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO BE BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER. THE BEAM AND LIGHT WERE VISIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 10 SECONDS, THEN BOTH DISAPPEARED AS SUDDENLY AS THEY HAD APPEARED. THE ORANGE LIGHT ITSELF WAS QUITE BRIGHT AND GLOWED FOR ANOTHER FEW SECONDS BEFORE FADING OUT COMPLETELY.

PAGE 4 RUMBJO 1 UNCLASS: BLUE COLORED OVAL-SHAPED OBJECTS WERE THE SUBJECT OF THIS CASE. SEVERAL PERSONS REPORTED HAVING SEEN THESE OBJECTS UNDER OBSERVATION FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. THE OBJECTS WERE DESCRIBED AS BEING 40 TO 50 FEET IN DIAMETER AND ABOUT 15 FEET THICK, WITH A BLUE COLORED LIGHT SEEMINGLY EMANATING FROM THEM. THE OBJECTS MANEUVERED OR HOVERED OVER THE CANYON FERRY RESERVOIR FOR SOME PERIOD OF SEVERAL MINUTES. AT TIMES THEY WERE OBSERVED TO DISCHARGE A BRIGHT BLUE-WHITE BEAM OF LIGHT DOWN TOWARD THE SURFACE OF THE WATER. THESE BEAMS WERE SEEN BY SEVERAL WITNESSES AND REPORTEDLY ILLUMINATED THE AREA BENEATH THE OBJECTS. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SIGHTINGS, THE LOCAL RADIO STATION WAS NOTIFIED BY WITNESSES WHO DESCRIBED WHAT THEY HAD SEEN. THE COUNTY SHERIFF DESCRIBES HIS OBSERVATIONS LATE ON THE SAME DAY... LAUGHED IT OFF AS LIKELY A PRANK OR HOAX BY PERSONS IN AN AIRCRAFT.

PAGE 5 RUMBJO 1 UNCLAS: 23937-12393 CLASSIFIED WITH LABEL SCATTERED GLASS. THIS SECOND PAGE OF THE REPORT INDICATES THAT SEVERAL PERSONS WERE WITNESSES TO THIS SIGHTING ON OR ABOUT 23 MARCH 39. IT REFERS TO A "4-CAR CARAVAN" AND THAT "ALL AT 23939" WERE PRESENT FOR THE EVENT. IT MENTIONS SPECIFIC DISTANCES AND DIRECTIONS INVOLVED, AS WELL AS TIMES OF OBSERVATIONS. FURTHER DETAILS INDICATED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED TO MANEUVER OR HOVER IN A VERY UNUSUAL MANNER OVER THE CANYON FERRY RESERVOIR, AND ALSO DISCHARGED A BRIGHT BEAM OF LIGHT DOWN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS. INVESTIGATION OF THIS CASE DID NOT RESULT IN ANY IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECTS, ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT THEY WERE LIKELY SOME SORT OF UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENON RATHER THAN CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. FURTHER DETAILS AND ANALYSIS OF THE CASE ARE ALSO INCLUDED.
