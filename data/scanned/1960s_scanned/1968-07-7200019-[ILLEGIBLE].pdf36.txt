Hector:
Reports on the second day of his report on the UFO Invasion of Seattle on July 7, 1947. A person sent me the original newspaper clipping of which I suppose he made this report.

The first-day story he sent is in the form of a poor report, which is typical of how the D.C. newspapers has reported this thing. I suppose if I had been a paper publisher, I would have sent you a cartoon. 

This is a classic case of how reported the UFOs exhibited a strong maneuverability, moved very way when he turned on his searchlighti. disappeared suddenly, slowed down considerably from great speed to 175 miles per hour, and eluded his attempts to it by 175 miles.
