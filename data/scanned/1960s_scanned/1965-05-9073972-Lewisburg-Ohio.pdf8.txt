Narrative as related to the best of my ability:
My sister went out of the house and the next thing she saw was the UFO. It started downward suddenly, then continued moving swiftly. As it came nearer, it seemed quite brightly lit. As she continued looking at it, it disappeared suddenly. During the entire observation, a running noise was heard. It was a powerful, bright object, almost at treetop level, and traveling very fast. Just a few seconds after it disappeared, it was seen again, hovering over a field across the road. Then it disappeared again over the treetops. After that, she saw it no more. It was a very strange and unexplainable experience.
