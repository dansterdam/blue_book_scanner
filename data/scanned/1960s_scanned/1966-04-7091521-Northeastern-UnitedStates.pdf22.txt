SUBJECT: NO PHOTO TAKEN

THIS CASE WAS INVESTIGATED AS A PART OF THE ABOVE ASSOCIATION I LOW REPORT THE CENTRAL PUBLIC WITCH HAS REPORTED I I HAVE TO BE ASSISTED PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER IN CHARGE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE ER 25-62 PROGRAM AT. 23.25 PM BY ATTENTION GIVEN TO WEATHER REPORTS BY VARIOUS WEATHER AGENCIES AND OFFICIAL SOURCES THAT FOR NON EXPLAINABLE ACCORDING TO CONVENTIONAL WEATHER PATTERN THERE WAS SAID A SIMILAR FLYING OBJECT SEEN BY SEVERAL WINTESSES IN A SOUTH FROM NEW JERSEY TO BOSTON AREA. FIGURE 2: ROUTE TAKEN FROM THIS CASE THERE WAS NO FINAL VISUAL CONTACT THE OBJECT AT SEAWARD PASSAGE OR DROP-OUT ON RADARS AND IT WAS REPORTED TO DID DISAPPEAR INSTANTLY AT 11.44 AM. CALLER DID DESCRIBE OBJECT AS A FAST BRIGHT STAR LIKE OBJECT WHICH HIS SIGHT HAD TROUBLE KEEPING UP WITH IN ITS RAPID TRAVEL. I BELIEVE THIS CASE IN POINT SHOWS THE PUBLICITY OF THESE KINDS OF OBJECTS MUST BE HANDLED WITH UTMOST CARE. I ALSO THINK TOO MUCH FOCUS ON ANY ONE SITING IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT SOME OF THESE SITING ARE THE GENUINE ARTICLEL HOWEVER MUCH CAUTION MUST BE USED IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND PUBLICITY.
