MYSTERY SPACE SHIP IS TOO FAST FOR Z-CAR

A COUNTY POLICE squad car was called to Radcliffe College last night to investigate an unidentified flying object. The police reported that the object was too fast for the squad car to keep up with and it disappeared from view.

The report stated that several students and faculty members witnessed the object, which was described as a bright, glowing craft that maneuvered rapidly through the sky over the college. It is the latest in a series of UFO sightings reported in the Cambridge area in recent weeks.

Campus police said they were unable to determine the nature or origin of the object. It was noted that the craft appeared to have no visible means of propulsion and made no noise as it moved through the air.

The incident has been reported to the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, which investigates UFO sightings. Authorities are urging anyone with additional information about the sighting to contact the Air Force or local law enforcement.
