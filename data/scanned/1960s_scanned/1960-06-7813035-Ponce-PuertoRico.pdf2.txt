Gentlemen:

Could you tell me what the object was that I observed in the sky on Wednesday, June 1st?

We were investigating a call received at the Ponce Intercontinental Hotel in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and were surprised to notice this very high altitude object.

I am sure that we might never have noticed it except for the fact that it was glittering, and it seemed quite close to the sun. This object appeared to be west of the sun, so close that it appeared to be almost touching it. It lay parallel with the sun, and shown brightly with the sun's reflection. 

In the forty-five minutes we followed its course, it seemed to move away from the sun, as about 11:30 A.M. we lost sight of it entirely. We were unable to obtain any photographs of the object.

To be sure we were accurate, we pointed this object out to the hotel guests. He was as surprised as we were. Could you confirm what object we sighted? Thank you.

Very truly yours,
