SAFOI-34/Col Tacker/77/66/24 Jun 60
24 June 1960

Dear Mr. [ ]
This is to acknowledge your letter of 6 June 1960 concerning an unidentified object you sighted on June 1st while vacationing in Puerto Rico.

A detailed analysis reveals the fact that your group observed the planet Venus. The planet was 7 degrees removed from the sun in a westerly direction which was of magnitude minus 3.4 on that date.

It is a rather novel experience to see planets in the daytime and many people do not realize that this is possible without a telescope. The indication that the object was spinning was probably due to prolonged staring at the planet while it was no close to the bright sun. It is also quite understandable that the planet was lost to sight after a long period of viewing this bright area.

I trust this information explains your sighting satisfactorily.

Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Lt. Colonel, USAF
