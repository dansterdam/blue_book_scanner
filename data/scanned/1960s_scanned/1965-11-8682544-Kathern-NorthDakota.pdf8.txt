Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially relative or vapor trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
A drawing of the object has been included, but it is not clear and appears to be only a rough sketch. The drawing shows the object as a crescent or arc shape, with an arrow indicating the direction it was moving.
