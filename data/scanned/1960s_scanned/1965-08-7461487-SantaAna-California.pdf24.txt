Controversy continued for third day on case of unidentified flying object seen by three military men at Santa Ana Air Facility.

Pacific Tele. & Tel. Co. employe told The Herald reporter he was driving along Edinger ave. near the base at 1:45 a.m. Aug. 3 when he saw a huge, glowing oval object hovering about 1000 feet above the ground. He said it was about 100 feet in diameter, and about the size of a large jet plane. 

"It made no sound," he said.

The incident was reported to the Highway Patrol and the Santa Ana Air Facility. An Air Force spokesman said they were investigating the incident.
