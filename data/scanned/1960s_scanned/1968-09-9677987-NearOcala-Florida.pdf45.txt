There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This seems to be a page from a document, likely a report, that describes a radar observation of a UFO incident near Ocala, Florida.

"them. We didn't have any idea of what this could be so we tried to get them through center and they had already transferred over to the approach frequency, so we got ahold of approach control at Palm Beach and told them that this aircraft had sighted a UFO and asked them if they saw anything in the vicinity of the aircraft, and if so, what it was. They said they had nothing in sight. We asked the approach control man to have the aircraft turn 360 degrees, turn a circle, and observe in his rear position to see if there was anything near him. Approach told him to turn; he made a turn in the approach pattern, made a circular turn, and did observe the UFO out behind him. 

H So this then... would you then consider this a confirmed simultaneous visual-radar observation.  

** Yes sir, we had him on radar.

H So you had both and this object... when he saw him in front of him it was because he had made this circle.

** On the last contact. Now before, whever he was up higher in altitude-- I think it was around 9,000 feet--he had this UFO out in front of him, and it would go off to the side and set motionless; it would come straight in at him and veer off away from him; they said it was extremely high speed and changed altitude, and everything. After that they lost contact with him; they didn't see him anymore."
