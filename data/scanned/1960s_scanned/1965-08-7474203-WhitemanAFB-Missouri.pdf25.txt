The image appears to be a photographic document from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's UFO investigation program. It shows a blurry black and white landscape image, with some indistinct shapes visible in the distance.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document, without any additional commentary:

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT

Case Number: 74-137
Date Time/GMT: 7 August 1965
Local Date/Time: 7 August 1965, 2040 CDT
Location: Whiteman AFB, Missouri
Witness(es): A/2C Durheim

Weather: Clear, calm, temperature 75 F.

Description of Object(s): 
At approximately 2040 CDT, A/2C Durheim was on duty as Security Policeman on the north perimeter at Whiteman AFB, Missouri. He observed an unidentified object hovering in the sky to the southwest. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter, round in shape, and white in color. It remained stationary for about 2 minutes, then rapidly ascended to the north at very high speed and disappeared from view.

Durheim stated that the object was much larger than a star or aircraft, and that it emitted no sound. He immediately reported the sighting to his supervisor and, on orders, to the local OSI detachment.

An investigation was conducted by OSI, but no additional information was obtained.
