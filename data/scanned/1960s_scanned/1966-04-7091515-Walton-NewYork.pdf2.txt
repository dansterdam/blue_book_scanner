Dear Mrs. Walton:

Your letter of 26 April 1966 to Governor Rockefeller has been referred to our office for evaluation. The event which you described in your letter was indeed the investigation of the meteor sighting which occurred throughout the eastern part of the United States. The meteor in question was photographed and it must have been a beautiful, bright phenomenon which very few people ever get to see.

I am enclosing copies of photos of similar events, but your meteor must have been much prettier than those which have been photographed in the past. Thank you for your interest in reporting this.

Sincerely,

VICTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
