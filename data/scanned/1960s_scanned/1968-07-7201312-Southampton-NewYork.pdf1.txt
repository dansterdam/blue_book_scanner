The text in the document is as follows:

On 14 July 1967 the observer reported sighting an object in the sky which had the characteristics of a UFO. The observer stated that the object was metallic in appearance and elliptical in shape. It was stationary for a period of time, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared out of sight. The observer estimated the object to be about 30-50 feet in diameter.

The observer claimed an photograph was taken but the film was underexposed and did not produce a usable image.
