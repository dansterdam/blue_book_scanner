The image shows a diagram or illustration of an inflatable structure in space. It appears to be a ballistic-type nose cone and re-entry vehicle that would also be the center hub, as discussed in the text. The image depicts the space craft in a deployed configuration, with details about its operation and capabilities described in the accompanying text.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
Here a ballistic-type nose cone and re-entry vehicle would also be the center hub and, as brought out in some of the earlier discussion, the space station would be packaged in this way. After deployment of the inflatable structure, the crew would move out into the working structure. 
As you can see, in the lower left-hand side, completely packaged, the inflatable components are securely attached. After deployment, the pressurized space station assumes the toroidal shape for maximum rigidity. The pressurized gas inside can be much reduced over that recently accomplished with the Mercury capsule. Figure 13 shows the launch configuration, which is perhaps better described by a movie which we can show now of the buildup of an inflatable space station model launch and deployed configurations.
