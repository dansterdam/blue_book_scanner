The image appears to be a photograph from a Project Blue Book report. It shows a grainy, black and white image of what appears to be an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky. The image is blurry and indistinct, making it difficult to make out any clear details about the object. There is no human face or person visible in this image.
