The image does not contain any photographs, but rather consists of two diagrams. The top diagram appears to be a compass or directional diagram, with the cardinal directions labeled. The bottom diagram shows a landscape scene with a figure standing in the foreground, and what appears to be a cloud or unidentified aerial phenomenon in the distance.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS, AS IT WERE, AND THE DIRECTIONS AS SHOWN INDICATE THE DIRECTIONS IN WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS OBSERVED WHEN LAST SEEN. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A Y AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN, TO INDICATE THE MOTION OR DIRECTION OF FLIGHT OF THE PHENOMENON. IF YOU CAN'T RECALL EXACT DIRECTIONS, JUST INDICATE THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF FLIGHT OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
