The image contains a compass-like diagram and two sketches. The compass-like diagram appears to be a visual aid for describing the direction of a phenomenon when it was first seen. The two sketches depict a person standing in a landscape, possibly used to illustrate the relative size or appearance of the observed phenomenon.

TRANSCRIPT:

AS YOU ARE AT THIS MOMENT FACING COMPASS AS SHOWN, DO NOT MOVE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. THIS IS ONLY APPROXIMATELY AND YOUR SKETCH NEED NOT BE HIGHLY DETAILED. FOR EXAMPLE, HOW THE LARGER SKETCH.
