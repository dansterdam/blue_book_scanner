Observed a steady stationary light in the sky. The light was very bright and appeared to be larger than a star. It was observed for about 30 minutes before it suddenly disappeared.

The witnesses were credible and reliable persons. The object appeared to be at a high altitude. There was no reported motion associated with the object.
