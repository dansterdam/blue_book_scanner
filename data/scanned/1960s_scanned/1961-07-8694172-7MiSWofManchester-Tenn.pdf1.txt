10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The observers, who were employed at an area weather station, observed 4 oval-shaped objects which appeared to be high altitude aircraft. The objects were first sighted at 1850 local time, moving from south to north at a high rate of speed, then stopping and hovering for several minutes. The objects then continued on a northerly course at a high rate of speed, maintaining a straight course. The objects, which were silver in color and appeared to have no wings or tail surfaces, were observed through binoculars and a telescope. The observers stated that the objects were larger than commercial aircraft and the light reflected from them was intense. No sound was heard. The observation lasted approximately 5 minutes.
11. COMMENTS This sighting was investigated by AF investigators and the details given appear to be accurate. There is no evidence to indicate that the objects observed were other than aircraft, possibly weather balloons. No further investigation is indicated.
