The sighting on 7/13/67 at Clyde, New York, lasted about 15-20 minutes. The object appeared to be very bright, lit from within, and hovering at a point about 500-600 feet off the ground. It was egg-shaped, with a dome on top. During most of the sighting, the lights seemed to dim and brighten several times. At one point the object appeared to emit a beam of light toward the ground, about 20-30 feet long. This beam seemed to scan the ground as if searching for something.

After 15-20 minutes, the object suddenly shot straight up at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight within 3-5 seconds. 

I was sitting in my car at the time, with my girl friend, and we both saw the object clearly. I thought at first that it might be a helicopter, but the speed and maneuverability were not at all like a helicopter. The movement was unlike anything I have ever seen before or since.

I have no explanation for what the object was, but I am confident that it was no conventional aircraft. I have a good knowledge of airplanes and helicopters, and this was nothing like anything I have ever seen before. It was a strange and eerie experience that I shall never forget.
