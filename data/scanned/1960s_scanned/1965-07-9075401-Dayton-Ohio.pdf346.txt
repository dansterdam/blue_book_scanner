Sighted a strange object on night of 4-26-65 at approx. 8:30 to 9:00 pm over our home in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. It was hovering stationary, then began moving quite rapidly toward the east. It was a bright light, somewhat larger than a star, and had a definite glow or aura around it. It was visible for about 5 to 6 minutes. Sounded like wind whistling or humming. It will some time later call for further information.
