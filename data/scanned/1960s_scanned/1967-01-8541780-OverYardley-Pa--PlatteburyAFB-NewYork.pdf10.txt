(The handwritten text on the page is as follows:)
"I was within 25 feet of this object and could see details quite clearly. It appeared to be about 25 feet in diameter and hovering approximately 10 feet off the ground. It was a bright chrome color and had no visible means of propulsion. There was no sound at all. After observing it for about 5 minutes, it simply disappeared into the night sky at a very high rate of speed. I was quite shaken by this experience and had difficulty relating the details to the authorities at the time. If there are any further questions regarding this incident, I would be happy to assist in any way possible."
