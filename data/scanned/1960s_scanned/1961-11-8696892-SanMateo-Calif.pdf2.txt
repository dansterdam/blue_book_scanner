Dear Mr. President-
I know you are a busy man, but I have to write you about a strange incident. I saw this good old U.S.P. object twice during a day. We thought at first it could be an aircraft but it was not. I waited at 5:45 A.M. and looked up with the glass and saw this strange object which I watched for some time. Then I tried to go to say the Civil Defense Center but found that they were closed. I could not contact them and I thought I had better write you about it directly. I hope this has reached you.
