"1530 May 4 1962
Captain Donald E. Keyhoe 
Glassboro, N.J.
Washington

Dear Captain Keyhoe,

My wife and I got along very well with reports from other sources of what we saw, light at the upper right corner of the sky disappearing rapidly. It seems hard to translate for more from dark to cloudly and on to disappearance in three to four seconds but that was the sequence as we observed it. We were 
faced with almost an impossible chance of determining exact measurements because everything had to be done instantan1eously. I received a sightingly high at 10:14 P.M. local time on April 25, 1962. The object came from the north, moved slowly at first, increased speed and then disappeared in the direction it had appeared. I would appreciate you comment on this report. Thank you.

Harlen AFB."
