REMARKS: AN OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 25 - 30 FEET ACROSS. IT HAD A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT ON IT WHICH WAS BRIGHTER THAN A CAR HEADLIGHT AND IT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY AT FIRST. THEN IT BEGAN TO MOVE VERY RAPIDLY AND SILENTLY IN SEVERAL DIRECTIONS IN A VERY ERRATIC MANNER. IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 500 - 1000 FEET IN THE AIR. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY MY SISTER IN NOV 1966 AND AGAIN BY MYSELF AND MY SISTER IN MAY 1967. WE WERE QUITE AMAZED AND EXCITED ABOUT THIS OBJECT AND WONDERED WHAT IT COULD BE. IT WAS NOT LIKE ANYTHING WE HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE.
