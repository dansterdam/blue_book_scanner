Air Force Sends Top UFO Report 
To Check Michigan Sightings

HILLSDALE, Mich.--UFO--A camp for bears, a civil defense director, an Air Force colonel, and a college student reporter were among those who reported seeing unidentified flying objects over southern Michigan in the past week.

The Air Force dispatched its investigating unit from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to check the sightings.

The witnesses told authorities they saw elliptical-shaped objects with flashing lights which at times appeared to hover and at other times to move swiftly through the sky.

The objects, sighted near Ann Arbor, Mich., the previous Thursday night, were reported to the Air Force the following Monday night. Their descriptions tallied closely with that of our sightmr, it was stated.

The Air Force said they launched an investigation. 

The witnesses were four college girls from the Hillsdale college dormitory, who reported they watched the objects for four hours, and described them as being about the size of a dinner plate, with blinking red, green, and white lights, flying in various directions.

Earl Garrison, the Hillsdale civil defense director, also reported seeing three unidentified objects over the city at about the same time, which he described as similar to the students' account.

Capt. William Van Horn, 37, assistant U.S. Air Force intelligence officer at the 4505th Air Base, said he also saw the objects and believed their descriptions as reported by the students and the civil defense director.

Capt. Van Horn said they appeared to be the same type of object reported at various points in the area.

The Ann Arbor News reported the sightings, and quoted a spokeswoman for the Air Force who said they had received a report and were investigating.
