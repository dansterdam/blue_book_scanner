Extracted text from the document:

EXPLANATION OF
WEATHER PHENOMENA
Weather phenomena are the chief source of UFO reports, and every effort should be made to discover their probable explanation. The atmospheric effects that are often seen are many and varied. The surface and structure of the atmosphere are constantly undergoing change, with temperature, pressure, moisture, and wind velocity all subject to continuous variation at all levels. The atmospheric conditions that may lead to the appearance of UFO's are frequently the result of the complex interplay of all these factors.

The letter - "WW" - is understood as meaning "Weather Watch", and the symbols are used to describe various atmospheric conditions and their associated descriptions.

The lower part of the document presents a grid with various numbered descriptors that correspond to different weather-related phenomena, along with their descriptions.
