This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely part of Project Blue Book, with various diagrams and handwritten text.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are of the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, then how many were there? Draw a picture to show how they were arranged, and give an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
