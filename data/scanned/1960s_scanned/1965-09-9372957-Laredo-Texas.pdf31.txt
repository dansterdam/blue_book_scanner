UFO Sightings
Hq USAF SAPOICC (Mrs. Hunt)

1. The Air Force has received five reports of unidentified objects from Mrs. Hunt's residence at Wright-Patterson AFB. The latest section at Wright Patterson indicates that there is, (9x5) circular, no data was presented. This suggests that the object is probably a constellation reflection which would not indicate an unidentified object. However, the visual characteristics described in reports could be consistent with an unidentified object, and in particular the light described in previous reports may indicate a hovering and maneuver which would give the visual characteristics as described in paragraph 2 below.

2. It is suggested that a fact sheet be attached to explain the present air force position on unidentified flying objects.
