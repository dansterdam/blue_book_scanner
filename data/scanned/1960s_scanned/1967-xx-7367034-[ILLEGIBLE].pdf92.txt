This image appears to contain two illustrations. The first is a compass rose diagram with labels indicating different directions. The second illustration shows two landscape sketches, one with a person standing on a road and the other depicting a distant horizon with mountains or hills.

Text extracted from the document:

AA. HOW HEARING YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN X OR ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A DOT OR CIRCLE NEAR THE CENTER TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE PHENOMENON DID PROCEED. IF ON THE COMPASS, PLEASE PLACE AN ARROW TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION IN
WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE BELOW SKETCH, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A SQUARE AT THE
POSITION WHERE IT WAS LAST SEEN. CONNECTED THESE TWO POINTS WITH A STRAIGHT LINE. THEN DRAW CURVED LINES ON EACH SIDE
OF THIS LINE TO INDICATE THE APPARENT PATH OF MOTION. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE
THE LARGER SKETCH.
