Dear Sirs;
On the nigbt of February 23, 1967, I spotted some strange object in a field across the way from my house. Upon examination I found it to be some form of aircraft- I took four rolls of film (32 pictures) of this thingâ€”the last one t s it taking off.
If this is some kind of secret vehicle or something 1 will refrain from acting on the issue. If, however, you have no knowledge or explanation for this, I will see to it that these pictures are published in every major news paper and magazine.
Sincerely,
