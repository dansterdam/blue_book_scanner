BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: College student, amateur astronomer, out observing stars. Observed 2-3 objects fly past, changed position from right to left. Total observation about 8 seconds, during which time the objects traversed through 15 degrees. No sound or trail. Color white but dull. Movement steady.
EVALUATION: CASE CATEGORY: Other (Birds)
CONCLUSION: Objects flew in group rather than formation. Took about 8 seconds to traverse 15 degrees of sky. At low altitude this is consistent with the speed of birds (about 30-35 mph). There was a slight light reflection effect from the movement, but this is often seen with birds, and the objects were not identified by the witness as such.
