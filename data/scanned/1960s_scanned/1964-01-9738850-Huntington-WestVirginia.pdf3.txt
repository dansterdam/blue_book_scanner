U. F. O. REPORTS,
WRIGHT-PATTERSON A. F. B.
GENTLEMEN:

THE TWO LETTERS ENCLOSED CONCERN TWO SIGHTINGS MADE A YEAR AGO LAST MONTH. - ILLNESS - AND QUITE A FEW OTHER THINGS - INTERVENED SO I AM SENDING THEM IN NOW ONLY FOR THE RECORD.

THIS SIGHTING WAS MADE SUNDAY MORNING BETWEEN 12 MINUTES OF 6 AM AND 9:15 MINUTES OF 6 AM, JANUARY 19, 1964. THE U. F. O. WAS ABOUT 50° ABOVE THE HORIZON TRAVELING IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO AN EAST BY NORTH POSITION WHEN IT DISAPPEARED.

THE U. F. O. WAS VISIBLE AS A POINT OF LIGHT, LIKE A STAR. CLASSIFYING THE MOVING STAR AS 1 IN SIZE, BRILLIANCE AND VISIBILITY WOULD GIVE THE U. F. O. A RANK OF NO. 3. THE LIGHT IT GAVE OFF PULSED OR FLICKERED JUST LIKE THE TWINKLING OF A STAR ON A CLEAR, COOL NIGHT.

WHEN I SAW IT, IT WAS MOVING FROM A WESTERLY DIRECTION (POINT A). IT TRAVELED ABOUT 50° ON THE HORIZON, MOVING DOWN AND IN A DIRECTION A FEW DEGREES NORTH OF EAST. IT THEN DISAPPEARED AS THOUGH THE LIGHT HAD BEEN TURNED OFF (POINT B). IT DID NOT FADE OUT IN THE HAZE OR GO BEHIND A CLOUD BUT SIMPLY VANISHED.
