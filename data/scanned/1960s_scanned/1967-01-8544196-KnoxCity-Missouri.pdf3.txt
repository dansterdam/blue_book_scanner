There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page of text from an old document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

THERE IS NOTHING IN THE PICTURE THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED AS SHOWING A FLYING OBJECT OR ANYTHING UNUSUAL. THE PAGE APPEARS TO BE TYPED TEXT ONLY, WITH NO PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES PRESENT.
