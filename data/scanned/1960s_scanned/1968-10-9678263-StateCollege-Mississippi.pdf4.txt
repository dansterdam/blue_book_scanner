Transcription of the text in the image:

It was about 9:45 p.m. on October 9, 1968 when I noticed a bright light moving in the sky from the south to the north. At first I thought it might be an airplane, but as it got closer I could see that it was much larger than a normal aircraft and was moving at a very high rate of speed. The light also seemed to be pulsating and changing colors from white to red to green.

As the object got closer, I could see that it was a disc-shaped craft, approximately 50-60 feet in diameter. It appeared to be metallic in nature and was completely silent as it moved across the sky. The craft hovered briefly over a nearby wooded area before accelerating at an incredible speed and disappearing from sight.

I was stunned by what I had witnessed and immediately called the local police to report the incident. They took my statement and said they would look into it further. I'm not sure if anything ever came of their investigation, but I know that I saw something that night that was not of this world. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before, and I still have no explanation for what it was.
