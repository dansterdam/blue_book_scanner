The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

At first it was a bright light. It was far away so it looked like a star. But then you got my binoculars and saw it clearly. It flew over the rooftops of right away. It moved the same way light moves, but it was bigger than a star. It would disappear for a little while and then come back. You couldn't really see it clearly. You could see a shape, but you couldn't make it out. It flew over the neighborhood and seemed to move all directions. This went on for quite a while. It flew over high and low and then finally disappeared.

Did the phenomenon move behind or in front of something, like a cloud, tree, or building at any time?
