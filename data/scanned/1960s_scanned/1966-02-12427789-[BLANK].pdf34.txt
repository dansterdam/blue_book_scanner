As far back as 1952 recommendations have been made to discontinue the project or transfer it to civilian agencies or contractors. However, continuation of the project under Air Force auspices is likely. Letter from General Mason 7 July 1955 to General Samford expressed the view that the reliance on a contractor would not reduce the responsibility of and therefore the load carried by the Air Force. Also, various studies have been made to transfer the project to other organizations within the Air Force.

CURRENT SITUATION: Personnel associated with the project are engaged in receipt of reports, investigation, analysis, and evaluation of these reports and maintenance of research and correspondence files. In addition, information is supplied to SANOL-GS which is a reply to more than 2,000 letters a year from individuals requesting information on the UFO program. From 1966 - 1969 the files were reviewed and placed in a standard format. Periodic statistics were recomputed on the basis of the actual case files. The actual case files were revised to provide information statistics. Periodic case summaries on cases of public interest are released. The current AFR 200-2 is under revision. Present Project Officer is Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
