The image contains a photograph. The text describes the object as first appearing like a large star, but then becoming larger, more translucent, and somewhat horizontal in the bright light, which prevented the observers from perceiving its exact shape.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes.  It vanished instantaneously.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One):   Yes    (No)   Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: _________

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound  None that I could hear.
b. Color  Color of a star, Probably like a yellow light, translucent.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the match stick is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the match head would have been covered by the object? 
It was a little larger than the largest star.  The largest two objects in the sky seemed to be a large star in the eastern sky, which is visible every night at that time of year, and this object which started in the north-northeast.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects.  Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc, and especially show trails or vapor trails.  Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[The image shows a hand-drawn sketch of an object in the sky. The object is described as appearing similar to a very large, brighter-than-normal star, and that it changed in size and shape over time, becoming larger, more translucent, and somewhat horizontal in the bright light.]
