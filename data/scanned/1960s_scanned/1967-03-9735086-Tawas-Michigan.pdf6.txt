There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report containing text describing an investigation of a sighting in Galesburg and Moline, Illinois.

INVESTIGATION OF MARCH 10-11: GALESBURG AND MOLINE, ILL.

Four witnesses or sets of witnesses were contacted and interviewed during this 1-1/2 day trip(since officers from Chanute Field were in the area also,)only the cases that sounded as if there might be something substantial to the story were investigated. In the course of the investigation, four or five incidental sightings dealt with by telephone. All were of the light-in-the-sky type, and could reasonably be attributed to Venus and Jupiter, or airplane landing lights. There were several brief interviews with newspapers and radio stations, in which the investigator gave a review of the bright objects which were in the sky and could be mistaken for something usual. The investigations with the principal witnesses are reported below.

Galesburg, Illinois. About 40 years old, and married; he has been a Deputy for at least 15 years. At present he conducts a night patrol alone throughout the outlying areas of the Sheriff's Department in downtown.

On the morning of March 6, at 0A25 (by watch), he was parked stop an overpass one mile east of Henderson, which is east several miles. He often stops here, because there is a good view of surrounding roads. At 0A25, he thought he saw a meteor or a fireball southeast of him, at least 15 miles away. This object was red in color, and may have been traveling apparently toward him; he saw shortly that it was nothing with which he was familiar, and (still in the patrol car) reached into the rear of the car.
