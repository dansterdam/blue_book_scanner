UFO CASE INFO ONLY 14'57-66?

Call from Battle Creek, Michigan, 17 May 66 (phone area 616 - 965-11 ext 617)17)  

I saw an aircraft, a Navy blimp. Checked with the radar boys. Have seen it enough times that may be we can identify blimp. 60 - 70 feet long, 17 - 18 feet in diameter, hydrogen fired. Because of its take off speed and the way it appears, 4.5 deg comes in between 30 - 45 deg. Comes in over the hills. When he takes off on Saturday.  

From the time he raises up and lifts his nose, gradually takes off and system up. Out of night 30 - 40 seconds. Seen this many times. Two story blimp, the engines in the bottom scary. Talked to radar people and they didn't have anything (Kustard) that's why he is disturbed. Talked to navy officers and some of the naval aviators and they said they never had anything on it. One boy said that it wasn't picked up on radar. He got this from his friend at Kustard. When saw it at them. Figures that it is an experimental aircraft. When it comes to him it scares him. Nothing about this craft that basic physics cannot build. This thing is probably firing through a torsion arc. Said that Gusard APB is going to send us a report but he would send it writing about what he saw so that we would be helped in identifying it and that maybe it will solve other cases.
