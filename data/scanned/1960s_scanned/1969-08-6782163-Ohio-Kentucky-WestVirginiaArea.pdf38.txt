The image contains two sketches or illustrations. The larger one is a compass-like diagram with various directional labels, presumably used to map the position of a phenomenon when first seen. The smaller sketches on the bottom show two landscape views, one with a person standing in the foreground and the other showing a distant landscape.

HOW TO MAKE USE OF THIS COMPASS-LIKE DIAGRAM TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN:
PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
MAKE USE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN "AA" AND "AB" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN FIRST AND LAST SEEN POSITIONS. THEN COMPARE THE LARGER SKETCH.
