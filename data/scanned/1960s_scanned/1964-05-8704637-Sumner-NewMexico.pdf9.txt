The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book. The text on the page describes a sighting of "strange objects over Dublin, Ireland" from the Dublin Garda station. The objects were said to be bright, silent, and traveling at a great speed from west to east. The report states that the objects were identified as a "flying saucer" but notes that no description or size are given.
