The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. The text on the page discusses radar returns and visual sightings, with the analyst concluding that no conclusions can be reached on whether the visual observations coincide with the radar returns.

M/R: MAJ Groening contacted Sgt Moody stating that FTD had been directed to reply to this message. Wanted to know if this was the proper authority that it was. Sgt Moody contacted Mr Bryant regarding the radar returns. He says it could not be radar indicates that returns could be caused by transmitting times signals, indicated in paragraph two of message. Did not think it was a malfunction due to the fact that eight returns were received. If a device would have triggered information on such a device it would be evident, would be detectable from Mr Goold, etc etc. That a solid object is not the cause of the returns.

The visual portion of the sightings - No conclusions can be reached as to whether the visual observations coincide with radar returns. Satellites ruled out if visual objects are consistent with radar returns, pending is the standard "go" (southward pattern). Aircraft are also ruled out if speeds are correct. In order for an evaluation of the visual sightings, data would be required.
