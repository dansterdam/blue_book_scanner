There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

Sincerely yours.

P.S. I told you that I didn't think they would admit to sighting anything themselves - I know they won't think it is important. But if you will get them to send me a letter saying they did not see anything, I will be satisfied with their cooperative message.
