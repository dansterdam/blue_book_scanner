MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SERVICES, OASD ATTENTION: MR. PETER A. ERICKSON

SUBJECT: Reply to Letter from Mr. [redacted]

Following is a suggested draft or reply to your letter [redacted] concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the sky over Toussville, Alabama on March 19, 1964.

"Dear [redacted]:

This is in reply to your letter of recent date in which you reported an observation of an unidentified flying object in the sky over Toussville, Alabama on March 19, 1964.

Thank you for reporting this observation to the U.S. Government. Your report has been reviewed and we find that the object observed was most likely one of our re-entry vehicles, sent aloft by one of our stations for tracking purposes. The vehicle and therefore parachutes were used to slow the vehicle down so it would not be damaged on landing.

Unidentified objects in the area reported it as an unusual sighting which would appear that they were sighting our re-entry vehicle.

We are enclosing, for your information, a Fact Sheet which has been compiled by the Air Force on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects and a report on the proceedings of the Unidentified Phenomena program. This will help to explain the Air Force program for the investigation and evaluation of reports on this matter.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
Public Information Division
