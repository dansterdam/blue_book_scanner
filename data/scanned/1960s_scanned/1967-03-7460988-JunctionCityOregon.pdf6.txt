The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

Transcription of the text:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 24 March 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. (Use additional pages if necessary)

Barking and continual activi- ty for about 45 min. after sighting. Also another object high over toward the East, which might have entered the sighting.

31. While talking to a friend, he told me that some of the people he knows have remarked on the location of these tight pines and how large they are. I have also been told that the Lane County area has attracted so much attention by the press as to whether there is anything in the area with Sheriff Harms or anyone else to track the UFO.

If you do come to any conclusion as to what was I would be grateful if you would let me know.

Thank you
