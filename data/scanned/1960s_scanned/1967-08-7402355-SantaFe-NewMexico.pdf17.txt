TDRF/UFO Maj H Quintanilla, Jr/70916/18/29 Dec 67

LTJ Observation & Photograph, August 9, 1967

Lancaster, Pennsylvania 17603

Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of August 9, 1967 at Santa Fe, New Mexico. Photo analysis was accomplished and it was determined that the object photographed was actually an aircraft contrail. The USAF has conducted a close examination of the collision side of the negative revealed slight evidence of retouching or 'touching up' of the film. However, this does not necessarily mean the original photograph was altered.

We are returning your slide and one print.
