Dep't UFO Say Out After Them
(Anglo-Texas Bulletin Bureau Service)
Deputy Sheriff Billy Martin and three other deputies say they saw a "flying saucer" up close Monday night.
The bizarre story of the deputies' experience goes like this:
Last Monday night about 10:30, the deputies were making a routine patrol along a country road near Damon, Texas, when suddenly they spotted a "flying saucer" hovering about 30 feet off the ground.
"It hovered in the light," they said. "It was shaped like a disc on edge. It had a glow around it, and you could see the lights on it. There was a blue one on its right side."
The deputies tried to find a safe place to stop their car and examine the strange object, but suddenly it shot straight up and disappeared from sight.
"We raced for our car and it was coming at us from all sides," said Cooley.
"We hit 80 miles an hour and the thing kept pacing us," a deputy said. "It was increasing our speed."
Say It Hovered
The unidentified object, Cooley said, hovered above the ground a few feet and then, with a brilliant flash on the horizon, suddenly disappeared.
"Then it just disappeared into thin air," the deputies said in their report. "We have seen things in our time, but we have never seen anything like that. They have just completely baffled and flabbergasted us. We just don't know what to make of it. But they say they DID see this thing, and they haven't lost their marbles."
