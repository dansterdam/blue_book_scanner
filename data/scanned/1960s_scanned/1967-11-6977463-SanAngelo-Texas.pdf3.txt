My father reported that at about 7:45 pm on September 16, 1967, while driving west on US Highway 67 about 15 miles east of San Angelo, Texas, he and his wife observed a bright light in the sky that appeared to be a very large aircraft. The light was first sighted at the southwest horizon and appeared to hover and move erratically. My father said the light was larger than any aircraft he had ever seen and seemed to be several miles away. The light appeared to be pulsating and at times flickering. The light remained in view for approximately 15-20 minutes before it suddenly disappeared. My father stated that he and his wife were very impressed by the unusual nature of the sighting and that they appear to be stationary while they were observing the light. In my opinion, the light was too bright and too large for a conventional aircraft. There are several witnesses and continued concern among them about this incident.
