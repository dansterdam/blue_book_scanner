UNCLASSIFIED

1. One photograph was obtained of what is believed by the observers to be the track of an unidentified object. It is known as an "Astrorapri" and was produced by one of the observers, Michael Holvoat. The photograph has been examined in detail with a microscope and shows a 2" diameter hole with a surrounding fog-like substance. It uses the mounting to allow for the guide telescopes weight. The photograph served as a hand-operated slow-motion drive to examine a portion of the exposed film.

2. Photo Analytic Division of IPCCOI and AFD evaluated the film.

3. Photostat copy of star chart where objects were sighted (prepared by observers).
