SOCORRO REVISITED

On Saturday August 15, I drove with whose car I had rented for the day, to Socorro from Las Cruces, New Mexico. We left Las Cruces shortly before 7:30 in the morning, and arrived in Socorro about 10:30am.

The object of this visit was to obtain an overview of the feelings and opinions in Socorro about the sighting of April 24th, after several months had passed, and to find out if the principals had any afterthoughts or changes which they wished to make in their story, how they were now regarded by the townfolk, and what if any was the official opinion.

The net results of the visit which involved talking once again with Sergeant Chavez, Captain Holder, the editor of the local newspaper, and seven other townspeople, was much the same as before. Sgt. Chavez, if anything, is more reticent and withdrawn. The more articulate Sgt. Chaves still firmly believes in story, and I found no contradictions between his partial retelling of the story and the original telling of his story in late April. Although I made a distinct attempt to find a chink in armor, I simply couldn't find anyone, with the possible exception of a who has a house fairly near the site of the original sighting, who did anything but completely uphold character and reliability, and I again talked with people who had known him since childhood.

I revisited the site; the markings are still there, but very much obliterated, and this time I was able to take stereo photographs of the general terrain. I was impressed more than before with the illogical nature of the landing site. If an ordinary aircraft had been in trouble and made a forced landing, the terrain at the site is such that it would have been a miracle if any kind of aircraft could have made a successful landing.
