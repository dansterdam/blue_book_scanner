Under section 36, you ask for a comparison with some common or familiar objects. Comparison with a straight line, or with a circle, or an outer chamber or ring reminded me of the accelerating chamber of a stellar chamber. There was a pulsing motion of some kind but I am unable to say whether it was a pulsing motion or not. I am very clear. These lines were a different shade or color than the rest of the object. They were not as translucent and appeared to be a different substance. The movements had to guided by an intelligence of some kind.

It is difficult to estimate the height, but I would say that it was over Ten thousand feet. One of the things that seemed very puzzling was the way it took off in a straight line across the sky at the 29 degree position. It did not rise by followed a line across the sky as one would a plane would do.
