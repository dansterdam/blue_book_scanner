Mystery Lights Aboard Ship
On 17 June, 1962, officlals at the US Naval Base at Subic, Philippine Islands, reported to the Naval Intelligence that on the night of 16 June, the Commanding Officer of the USS Fortaleza, an officer of the Philippine Navy, had reported sighting about strange unidentified lights seen around the docked Fortaleza. The lights were described as white in color, unusual in appearance, and seemed to be circling the ship on a coral reef near Quezon Island on Lingayen Gulf. The lights were observed for about 2 1/2 hours, after which they disappeared. A search party later found the Fortaleza undamaged. The body of a mystery ship, "Vesla", was found after disappearing some time before. The body is now beached at Laoag.
On 23 July, the officers of the Fortaleza gave a formal report. Commander Peter Westwood, Mr. J. Matheson and a guide translated. They stated that the lights were seen near the Fortaleza and that a light investigation was conducted, but the lights could not be identified. They remained constant and did not seem to be searchlights from another fishing vessel. At one point the lights appeared to be reflected in the water indicating their hovering over the surface. The lights faded gradually and were not seen to move or land. The officers could not account for the lights and had no explanation for them.
