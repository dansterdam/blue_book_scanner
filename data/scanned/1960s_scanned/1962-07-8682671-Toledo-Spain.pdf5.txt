October 5, 1962

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Your letter of July 16, 1962 to Cape Canaveral has been referred to this office. I agree that your description of the delay in reporting your sighting before finally reaching the office of primary interest.

Our records indicate that Echo I, which is 100 feet in diameter, was moving northbound about 17 miles north of Madrid moving in a southeasterly direction at 17 minutes after midnight on 13 July, 1962. It should have been at an elevation of 32 degrees, which would put it in the line of sight you have indicated with reference to Uranus Majorus. 

May we express our appreciation for your interest and promptness in reporting your sighting.

Sincerely,

W. J. LOCKADOO
