NO CASE INFORMATION ONLY, 19 SEP 64, ANGPEDONTA, ITALY

Mrs Ratti/SAPPIGO/PHONE/13 MAY 65

Dear Mrs. X,

I am writing to inform you that we have completed our investigation of the sighting report you submitted concerning the unidentified flying object observed in the sky over Angpedonta, Italy on 19 September 1964.

In keeping with the general policy of Project Blue Book to inform individuals who report sightings of the results of our investigations, I am providing the following information:

As a result of our investigation, over 2000 reports of unidentified flying objects are received and reviewed each year. Comparison with past records indicates that the great majority of these are later found to be explainable as known or natural phenomena. Only a very small percentage remain unidentified after investigation.

The object sighted by you on 19 September 1964 appears to fall into the "explainable" category. There are no features of your report which would suggest the object was of extraterrestrial origin or which could not be accounted for by misidentification of a conventional aircraft, satellite, or other natural phenomenon.

Accordingly, I must inform you that the object sighted by you does not represent evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting our planet. The investigation of your report has been completed and no further action is contemplated.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to write.

Sincerely,

Ministero della AM 
Direzione Generale 
Servizi A.M.I.
