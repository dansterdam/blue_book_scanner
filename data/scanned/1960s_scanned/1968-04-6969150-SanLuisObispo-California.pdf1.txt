10. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers sighted a pattern of yellow lights similar to those of an airplane, but the lights did not blink off and on, and the noise could not be heard because of the noise from a jet in the area. Surface winds at San Luis Obispo at 2020 hrs. were calm. Several vantage points from land and sea were taken, but the objects were not seen as air balloons before and didn't think that a hot air balloon caused the sighting. There were several large aircraft quite near the observer and several aerial advertisers operate in the area. It is quite possible that the observation was the result of one of the numerous aircraft that operate in the area. Probably one of the observers' attention.
