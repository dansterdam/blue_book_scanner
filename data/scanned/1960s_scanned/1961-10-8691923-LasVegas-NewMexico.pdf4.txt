Transcription of the text in the document:

Received a call from Maj. the WF radar at the Capehart housing area of Semmer Johnson AFB, which was passed on and some officers were stationed immediately to investigate this report.

He reported that a good sized metallic ball of light the size of a small car, approximately 25 feet in diameter, was observed descending from a northerly direction at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The object came to a complete stop in the air, hovered for about 30 seconds, and then accelerated in a westerly direction at a high rate of speed, climbing as it went, and disappeared from sight. The sighting lasted about 1 minute. Two observers watched the object from the AFB.
