Memo for the Record:
Major Hydo called from Selfridge AFB in regards to the 14 Jan 67 Major Hyles was convinced that this 26 Jan 67 sighting clearly took pictures of a UFO and a helicopter. The pictures clearly indicate that the helicopter picture was taken in the main of the pictures of the UFO. The numbering scheme on the photos indicate this fact to be true. The boys said that they saw the helicopter in the pictures. If this is a direct lie, he said the from his calculations, picture number 5 was taken from a circling position. The camera was definitely lower in picture 5 than the rest. The object in picture 5 is higher in relation to the helicopter than the other pictures. If the object had stayed at the same position, it would have been higher in the resulting condition.
