SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OVER HARTFORD, CONN., 8 SEPTEMBER 1960.

ON 8 SEPTEMBER 1960 AT APPROXIMATELY 2130 HOURS, THE HARTFORD POLICE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM MR. JOHN DOE, A RESIDENT OF HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT. MR. DOE REPORTED THAT HE HAD OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE SKY OVER HARTFORD. HE DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS BEING ROUND IN SHAPE AND EMITTING A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT. MR. DOE STATED THAT THE OBJECT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES AND THEN SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

THE HARTFORD POLICE DEPARTMENT IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE AIR FORCE OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS (OSI) DETACHMENT AT BRADLEY FIELD, WINDSOR LOCKS, CONNECTICUT. OSI PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION.

BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH MR. DOE AND OTHER WITNESSES, AS WELL AS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE GATHERED AT THE SITE, THE OSI INVESTIGATORS CONCLUDED THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS A METEOR OR BOLIDE ENTERING THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE. NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS DEEMED NECESSARY.
