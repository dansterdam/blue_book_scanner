North Canton, Oct 11, 1962
A husband and wife who live near the air-port saw a dome-shaped object-moving at extremely slow speed from 3 to 5 min. The object was at 20° elev, not higher. It appeared to have a lighted sky-shaped object. It seemed to appear irregularly and simultaneously. They observed this lighted object through 50° azimuth in 15min. The object traversed the red light and passed between the red light and the witness. No sound. The size was compared to a dime at arm's length. Both saw it. "This wasn't a star, they said. The object was flying that night.
