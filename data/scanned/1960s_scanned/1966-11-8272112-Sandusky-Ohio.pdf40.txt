I JUST WISH TO SAY THAT MYSELF, WIFE AND FRIEND WITNESSED SOMETHING EXTRA-ORDINARY. I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO THE TWO OTHER PEOPLE TOGETHER SINCE THAT NIGHT. MY WIFE CERTAINLY IS CONVINCED THAT WE SAW THAT OBJECT AND DESCRIBES IT AS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY. I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO THEM TO HAVE THEM TELL THEIR STORY AND I AM CERTAIN IT WAS SOME THING EXTRAORDINARY THAT WE SAW THAT NIGHT. IF THERE WAS SOME EXPLANATION OR NATURAL PHENOMENAE WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR WHAT WE SAW, I WOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW OF IT. SINCE THAT NIGHT, WE DENY OF THE FACT THEY DENY OR REFUSE TO DISCUSS THE OBJECT WE SAW THAT NIGHT. THEY ARE EITHER SHORT OPEN OR SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL OF THE OBJECT.
