Antarctica -- (Continued from page 3)
Many months ago, a strange light and maneuver caused interference in the electro-magnetic instruments of the Argentine base station on the Argentine islands. Its red-yellow colour changed to green and orange. It was flying at a relatively low altitude of 45 degrees, over the north of the islands, and moving in a zigzagging course.  
It hovered in mid-air after performing some of its maneuvers, remaining motionless for about 20 minutes and then moving away at high speed. We observed the high-power binoculars and theodolites. It don't believe it could be an airship or a terrestrial manufacture. As an officer of the Chilean Air Force, my knowledge about unmanned machines gives me the conviction that nothing similar exists on earth in shape, velocity and mobility in more "We have taken photographs which will be developed in Santiago.
"As soon as we sighted the object we tried to contact the Argentine and English bases. But such contact was impossible because there was a very strong interference on the radio channels. With the radio useless and under intense emotion we continued to watch the thing in space, on a clear night without winds..." Unquote.
