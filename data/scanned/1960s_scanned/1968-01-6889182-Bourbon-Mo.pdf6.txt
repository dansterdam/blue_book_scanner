"INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

On June 3, 1961 at about 7:30 p.m. Central Standard Time, my neighbors and I observed a very bright object in the sky. It first appeared in the north and moved in a southerly direction to a point directly overhead. The object appeared to be disc-shaped and was of a metallic silvery color. The edges were well-defined and the object seemed to revolve or spin as it moved. It was accompanied by a trailing light that appeared to be a flame or exhaust. The object was in sight for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared in the distance. My neighbors and I were quite excited and disturbed by the incident. We had never seen anything like it before. There was complete silence and the object moved without any sound. This was an extremely unusual and unidentified phenomenon which I am sure was not an aircraft, missile, or satellite. I have often thought of this incident and have wondered if others in the area may have observed the same object on that evening. I would be very interested in knowing if your organization has any information on this type of incident or if you have received any other reports from this general area during that time period."
