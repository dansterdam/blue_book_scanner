In The Sky: What Was It - Who Saw It?

Up in the sky! It's a . . . . .
What was it? Who saw it? This is the report, sent to us by a half-dozen or so brilliantly-lighted objects that were seen near Rockledge, Florida, last January 13th. The objects appeared south Wednesday morning about 4:30. 

The article says that the writer of the report asked that her name not be used, and that she saw while driving south on U.S. 1 at about 4:30 a.m. were something that she wanted to know "what they were" -

She wanted to know "The Tribune could not tell her, so this announcement is by way of it," 

Did anyone else see the long, slender, northmoving objects yesterday morning?

If so, give the paper a call. Our doing this gives the public an indication of quite a white. . .

Whatzits Seen In Sky It's Still Mystery

Two additional reports have been received concerning those "whatzits" moving through the sky, apparently searching for an unstated object, said Cocoa Tribune. 

The other reports, also from the same general area, were that the first sightings were of brilliantly white, moving objects, numbering about six.

One saw the objects from a hiding place on the south River Drive, near where the fleeding woman had said she had seen the white "things" moving southward. 

Whoever has done a bit of poking, but still can offer no definite answer as to what the "unidentified flying objects" were.

Some learned that balloons had been released somewhere in the vicinity, but whatever has been flying, no one says he's heard any reports of any such "things" being seen any other time.
