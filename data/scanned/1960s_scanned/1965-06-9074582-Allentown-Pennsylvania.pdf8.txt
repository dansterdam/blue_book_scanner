The document appears to be a letter thanking her for sending the laboratory an account of her "unexplained experiences" and stating that the laboratory is grateful for her reports, which they would welcome further such reports from her and her friends.

Mrs. [redacted]
Allentown, Pennsylvania

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

Thank you for sending this laboratory an account of your unexplained experiences. I wish it were possible to reply personally to all who wrote, but the response to the request has been so extensive that this is not practicable.

These occurrences from everyday life are the spontaneous events to which science has given us some of our main clues for research. While we do not try to draw final conclusions from such data, we do use them in an effort to throw light on the nature of man. We are grateful, therefore, for your reports, which are of course confidential and which welcome other you may have or may persuade your friends to send us.

Unfortunately our research is not yet at a stage at which answers to all the questions raised are available. However, if you are interested in reading something more about our work, we would be glad to send you an introductory pamphlet and a list containing references for further reading.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
