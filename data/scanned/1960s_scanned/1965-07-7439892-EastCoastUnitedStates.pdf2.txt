Memo, TDSW/UFO, 23 Aug 65, Request for Radar Analysis (U)

1st Ind. (TDSED/Capt Dunlap/pk/74201) 31 Aug 65
TO: TDSW/UFO

1. The attached memo for the record provides insufficient information to enable a radar analysis of the situation. In order to perform an analysis, it would be necessary to know the types of radars involved, their operating radio frequencies, types of signals generated, weather conditions between radars and the indicated targets, equipment location and the directions of target travel.

2. In addition, the nature of the target appears to rule out direct observation, as natural objects would not be able to change directions radically as the observed speeds. This leads one to believe that the observations were via anomalous propagation of the radar waves. When atmospheric conditions are right, anomalies can play a significant role in radar detection which is often difficult to substantiate. This occurrence may be one of these cases; however, additional information could prove otherwise.
