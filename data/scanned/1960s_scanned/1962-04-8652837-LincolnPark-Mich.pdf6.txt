Sighting of 'Unidentified Objects' at 4:30 p.m. on 7 March 1962 in Lincoln Park, Michigan
At about 4:30 p.m. on 7 March 1962, a witness, while driving along Dix Street in Lincoln Park, Michigan, observed three unidentified objects in the sky. The witness reported the sighting to the Lincoln Park Police Department, which in turn reported it to the nearby Willow Run Radar Station.
The witness stated that the objects were at an estimated altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet, and that they were moving at a speed estimated to be in excess of 1,000 miles per hour. The witness further stated that the objects appeared to be a dull gray or silver color and were approximately the size of a basketball. The witness also reported that the objects were making a high-pitched whining sound and that they appeared to be metallic in nature.
The witness was able to observe the objects for approximately 3 to 5 minutes before they disappeared from sight. The witness stated that the objects were moving in a straight line and that they did not appear to be affected by the wind. The witness also reported that the objects were not affected by the jet aircraft that were in the area at the time.
The Lincoln Park Police Department contacted the Willow Run Radar Station, which confirmed that they had detected the objects on their radar screens. The Willow Run Radar Station also reported that they had observed the objects moving at a high rate of speed and that they had disappeared from their radar screens at the same time as the witness had reported.
The incident was reported to the U.S. Air Force and was investigated as part of Project Blue Book, which was the official U.S. government program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The investigation was unable to determine the nature or origin of the objects, and the incident remains classified as an unidentified flying object.
