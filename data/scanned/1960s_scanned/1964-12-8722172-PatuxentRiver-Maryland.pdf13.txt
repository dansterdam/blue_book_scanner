Patuxent RAS, Maryland
29 December 1964

Based on results of an investigation by the Patuxent RAS and analysis of information supplied to the Air Force by the Navy, it has been determined that false radar targets were mistakenly reported as unidentified flying objects on 29 Dec 64. Study of the shape and illumination of the return indieates that they were created by some other device within the station or were caused by an intermittent abnormal condition within the circuitry of the radar set itself. This conclusion has further verified by a check with an independent radar complex at the NAS and with adjacent radar sector centers on the East coast which showed no corresponding radar return on that date.
