AP IN : 17545 (24 AUG 65)                           4 OF 4

INTELLIGENCE/THIS PARTICULAR OBSERVATION OCCURRED DURING THE
PERIOD OF MY REPORT, DUBIN 0089. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS PERSON
SAW THE SAME OBJECT AS COVERED IN THE OTHER REPORT. HOWEVER THE
PAGE 4 OF RUCODU 9 UNCLAS
OBJECT APPARENT MOVEMENT TO THE EAST WOULD TEND TO RULE THIS OUT.
THE COLOR OF RED AND GREEN BEING EMITTED BY THE OBJECT CAN POSSIBLY
BE EXPLAINED THAT THE OBSERVER WAS ONLY SEEING THE RED AND GREEN
PORTIONS OF THE COLOR SPECTRUM DUE TO IMMEDIATE LOCAL DUST CONDITIONS
OR LIGHT REFRACTION OCCURING AROUND THE OBJECT. IN THE PAST, I HAVE
NOTED THAT STARS OCCASIONALLY SEEM TO EMIT GREEN AND RED LIGHT.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OBJECT SEEN WAS A SATELLITE BUT MOST PROBABLY
A STAR.
12. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE
13. MISC. COMMENTS BY THE OBSERVER: NONE
