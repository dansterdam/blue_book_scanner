The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and transcribe the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):            Yes           No            Don't Know.           IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):            Yes           No            Don't Know.           IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. With a match, show me angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any data is of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
