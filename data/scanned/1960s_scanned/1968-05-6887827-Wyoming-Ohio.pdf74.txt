The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

(3) Angle of elevation of object(s) upon disappearance: 
Use elevation or compass measurement if possible.

(4) Description of flight path and maneuvers of object(s):
(Use elevations and azimuths, not attitude.)

(5) How did the object(s) disappear? (Instantaneous to the north, for example?)

(6) How long were the object(s) visible? (Be specific--5 minutes, 1 hour, etc.)

c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Use one or any combination of the following items:  
Ground-visual, air-visual, ground-electronic, air-electronic.
(If electronic, include details.)

(2) Statement as to optical aids (telescopes, binoculars, etc.) used and description thereof.

(3) If the sighting occurred while airborne, give type of aircraft and location.

d. Time and Date of Sighting:
(1) Greenwich date-time group of sighting and local time.
