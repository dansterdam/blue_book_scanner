Officer of Information
SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20330

Gentlemen :

Dr. W. J. von Braun, that the Airforce is "conducting investigations on UPO's" and that publication can be obtained.
1) On a tapped note P-234 I have analyzed the incident UFO-sighting at Westminster - (Massachusetts), which occurred on 9/16/65. As the most reliable assumptions can be made: the UFO diameter (3-5 feet minimum) and still better profile to the ground, i.e. 1/3 to 1/2 of my residence can certainly be obtained.
2) My method can be further developed and enlarged. I do not know, how far the Airforce is going scientifically with the problem of UFOs. My suggestion is, to analyze my incident considering the relevant facts from the point of view of the question, whether UFO's are real or not and make very thorough analysis.
3) Please forward my letter and the print P-234 to the Air Force investigating of-fice.
4) It will be another month, until I can hopefully submit another monthly information-building on UFO-analysis. Did you publish any on the Westminster case? 
5) Also I do not see, what you have done with the pictures of the UFOs, which were sent some time ago from the Air Force. Doubt whether one must be pessimistic, until the last photographic evidence is analyzed to the fullest.
6) As an UFO layman I suggest, that every UFO-picture should be evaluated to the maximum and that should be done with very possible care. My note is a hint, what should be done with every photo offering a clue to the UFO-analysis.
7) I hope you can be assisted in the UFO-analyzing and should that an occasional number of the Airforce investigating team gets in touch with me.

Encl.: P-234.

Sincerely yours,
Mech. Eng. ret. American citizen.
