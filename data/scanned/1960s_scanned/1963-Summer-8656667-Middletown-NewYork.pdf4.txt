REFERENCE the attached letter from requesting
information on an unidentified flying object which she observed
about two years ago. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear Mrs. 

Your observation of about two years ago is, of course, 
too old to warrant an investigation. The sighting in itself is 
very interesting and perhaps could become identified as a known
object under the expanded Blue Book program.
