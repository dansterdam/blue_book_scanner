My sister's name is [REDACTED] the yard pictured is where the tree is that we saw the UFO above. The yard had two dogs in it. The dogs were always barking at us. Now I looked up and there it was. It looked like a meteor, only the shape was different. It had capsules [REDACTED] tall right behind the capsule. The rest was just a yellow light. My first reaction was, "Oh, my God, R.J.-LOOK!" I looked up in time to see it, they say it was traveling fast. Then an odd thing happened. As soon as I pointed to it, the dogs stopped barking. Then the lights went out - in a sequence. Soon it disappeared from sight (UFO in diagram). I thought maybe it was a meteor, than I thought about the lights. Then it they thought it was a flare somebody threw up in the air. I took a flashlight and went looking for anything that could have been an explanation. I found nothing. It was 10:00 p.m.
