The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, possibly a UFO report from Project Blue Book. The text of the document is as follows:

but minutes of are were retained in this work, and final results were rounded off to the nearest tenth. The deseending angles and distances to the path were determined at different intervals of the object's descent, most of its path, but a few reported a change of direction in the vicinity of the object, some observers also mentioned differences in distance to the path and in angular size, apparently corresponding to changes in the object's apparent size.
Many observers compared the angular diameter of the object with the apparent diameter of celestial objects' the comparison is difficult, but measures of angular diameter were obtained from three photographs by Veronica Johnson of Westbury, New York, which cover the descent of the object as seen from the Rockland County Police Department June, 1966, cover shows fully a dozen different sets of measurements, indicating the difficulty of distant observers in noting the details of an object's size and shape.
The descent was studied at Drs. Smith Observatory, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the same evening by a team directed by D. B. Spencer (Gettysburg, Pennsylvania), but it developed bumps that made the interpretation and precision more difficult. 
T. D. Nicholson (Woodchuck Lane, New Jersey) observed the path, but the observed angular velocity was slow and the height was estimated to be 10" above the terrain, but appeared to be influenced by buildings and terrain, and it was difficult to determine the exact height and path.
The angular velocities determined in three cases were calculated for the observed in place around the sun of 1 1/4 minutes of arc.
