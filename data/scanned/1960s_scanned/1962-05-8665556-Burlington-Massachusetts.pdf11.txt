CASE OF A REPORTED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
OBSERVER: Mrs. Doris R. Bingham
DATE: 8 May 1962
TIME: 2100 hours (9:00 PM)
LOCATION: Burlington, Massachusetts
WEATHER: Clear, stars visible

OBSERVATIONS:
At approximately 9:00 PM on 8 May 1962, Mrs. Doris R. Bingham, residing at 27 Dexter Place, Burlington, Massachusetts, reported observing a bright, disc-shaped object in the night sky. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Mrs. Bingham described the object as being "silvery" in color and estimated its size to be about the same as a full moon. The object appeared to be hovering and stationary, but at times, would move slowly from side to side or up and down. No sound was associated with the object. After approximately 10 to 15 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view.

CONCLUSION:
Based on the information provided, this case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The object observed by Mrs. Bingham does not match the characteristics of any known aircraft or natural phenomenon. Further investigation would be required to determine the nature and origin of the reported unidentified flying object.
