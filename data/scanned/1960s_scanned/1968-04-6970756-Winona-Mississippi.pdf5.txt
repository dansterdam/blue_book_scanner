EXTRACTED TEXT:

The meeting was attended by several guests, some known, some strangers to the witness. They were not invited but came on their own as if they knew Almeida was going to be there. They formed a circle around him and conversed in whispers.

Almeida became nervous and excused himself saying he had to leave on an errand. As he walked away, the group parted to let him through and then closed the circle again. Almeida did not return and the group eventually dispersed.

The witness stated he believes Almeida was afraid of these people and did not want to remain with them. The witness could not identify any of the individuals in the group but stated they appeared to be in some kind of conspiratorial meeting or discussion.
