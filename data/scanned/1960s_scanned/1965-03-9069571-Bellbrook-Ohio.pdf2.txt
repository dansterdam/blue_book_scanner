A stream of bright light - about the size of a quarter and seemed to be made of a metallic shiny substance - passing approximately a mile or mile and a half in a horizon direction moving very rapidly about 30-45 degrees above the horizon on March 30, 1965 at approximately 11:30 P.M. The object seemed to approach and move away very rapidly. It was triangular in shape and was observed for about a minute or less. The witness reported a number of people also seeing the same object at the same time in the Bellbrook, Ohio area.
