2 Brothers Photograph
MARCH 16, 1967
By DON LESCHMAN

Two Torrance boys who went out to play Saturday afternoon, but ended up in the "Twilight Zone."

The kids were convinced they saw a flying saucer - but no one would believe them.

The entire affair seemed strange to them, because they knew they saw something but couldn't convince anyone else.

"It was another world - real strange - like something you see on television."

But the youngsters may have the last laugh. It turned out they had proof of some kind of unidentified flying object in their little box camera.

"We know we saw something. There is proof to show our parents, Rick Gerety, 15, of 5007 Delane St., said.

Rick photographed the object, and he and his brother Dan, 14, and two friends, Bob, 15, and Al, 15, of 3509 Delane St., spotted the thing over Torrance Saturday afternoon.

The boys had trouble convincing anyone of their discovery.

"Then the boys came in the 'Daily Breeze' to reveal the incidents," said Michael Ruggers, 19, of 2346 Torrance), and he distributed the negatives for the youngsters, but said no one could see the objects.

"We went to my house and then to Bob's parents, but they wouldn't believe us," Rick said.

"But then we went over to another friend's house (Michael Ruggers), and he said, 'I'll be. Look what you got there,' " Rick said.
