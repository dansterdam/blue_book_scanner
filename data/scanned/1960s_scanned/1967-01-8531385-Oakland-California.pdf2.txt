18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?: 3 times the size of the match stick head

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. The object appeared at an altitude of about 10-15,000 feet and travelled at a very high rate of speed from east to west, with exhaust trail, shaped somewhat like a jet fighter. The object was moving rapidly.
