1. Reference telephone conversations on 20 Jul 64 between Sgt. Roady, SIC, and History, WRCX.

2. Attached are copies of the newspaper clippings on stories about unidentified objects sighted in the Augusta, Georgia area.

3. These are possibly separate from the UFO report out of Anderson, S. C. of 27 June 64. In that case, witnesses were referred to by Lt. Col. Michael J. Farrell, USAF, to the Robins AB Security and Law Enforcement Division. Lt. Col. Farrell stated that the report was classified by BLUE BOOK and it was not possible to obtain copies of it. It was further agreed that no written report would be submitted to Robins.
