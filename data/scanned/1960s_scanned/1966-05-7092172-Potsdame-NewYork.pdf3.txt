SUBJECT: UFO sighting

TO: AFSC PTD
Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio

Due to elapsed time on receipt of this sighting (9 days), no reliable conclusions informable. Description fits past experience where planet Venus emits various hues of light and appears anomally large when it rises ahead of sunrise-sunset movement; up and down, probably caused by refraction. Other apparent movements could be observable from moving vehicle.
