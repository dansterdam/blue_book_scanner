SUBJECT OF SEARCH: REPORT TO PROJECT BLUE BOOK
1. At about 2200 local on 6 Nov 60 the witness C.G., a plant guard employed at the ABC Screw Products Corp., saw what appeared to him to be a flying machine or object maneuvering silently in the air over the southern outskirts of Alliance, Ohio, the town where his plant is located. He said that a greenish light was visible at various points along the outline of the object. He ran to the northeast corner of the plant property and observed the object which appeared to be hovering in a stationary position.

2. At about 0230 on 7 Nov 60, C.G. called the Alliance Police Department and advised them of what he had observed and requested that they send a patrol car to the scene. The officer was dispatched and remained at the site for approximately 15 to 20 minutes during which time he also observed the object. The officer said that it maneuvered silently and that the greenish light was visible at various points around the perimeter of the object. He said that it remained stationary at one point and then moved off to the west at a rapid rate of speed, appearing to increase its altitude as it moved away. 

3. Since the occurrence, C.G. has called the Akron office of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations to determine if a balloon or satellite could have been responsible for the sighting, but was informed that nothing was known to have been in the area at the time. He was advised that the investigation would be handled by Project Blue Book.
