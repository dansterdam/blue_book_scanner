The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten report or document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

The information which you have submitted deals with an unidentified aerial object which was observed on 9 June, 1967 near Covington, Kentucky.

The object was described as a round, lighted object which was brighter than the stars. It was very bright, and was observed for several minutes. The object changed direction and speed a number of times. It was not an airplane.

Most interesting (sic) and important point in this case is the fact that the object was observed at close range (25 yards) and was described as having a definite shape and color. Despite the close observation, no details of the object's construction were reported. Nor were there any landing traces or other physical evidence.

In view of the limited information available, I am unable to arrive at any definite conclusion regarding the nature of the observed object. The case is classified as unidentified.
