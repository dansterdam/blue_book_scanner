The witness who saw the object was in the home of a friend at about 2100 hours on 26 Aug 65 when he noticed an unusual light in the sky through a window. He went outside and saw a very large object, illuminated and egg-shaped, which was observed for about 30 minutes. The object did not move and remained stationary, though the witness could see that there was some activity or movement within the object, which he described as a "pulsing effect" while he was watching it. No sound was heard. The witness stated that the object was much larger than a normal aircraft and that it appeared to be hovering. He felt that this was no aircraft that he had ever seen before. He reported the incident to the Ministry of Defence.
