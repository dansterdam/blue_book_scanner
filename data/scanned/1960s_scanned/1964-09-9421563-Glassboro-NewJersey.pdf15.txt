Text transcription:

It was about 3:15 PM, Saturday afternoon, when these Renderskit and J. Walt Klinglng arrived at the scene. Here the clearing was first found.

The clearing was located in a wooded area containing mainly traces of oak, hickory, sassafras, and a few pines. These trees are all common to southern New Jersey forests. Other similar landmarks are near all common plants, shrubs, and mosses which are found throughout the southern New Jersey area.

The clearing in which the markings were found is located about 100 yards from the dirt road leading from Pitman to Glassboro. A house located about 600 yards from the scene at 600 yards is within hearing distance of the crater. Any explosion or the size needed to create a crater or comparable measurements would be audible to the occupants of the house. There is no main highway and is presently not well travelled at night. This all adds to the probability of any loud noises, and especially an explosion, would have been reported to the police or anyone else by the occupants of this house.

The possibility remains, however, that the occupants were responsible for the whole thing. This is doubtful since those who discovered the crater would have probably recognized their neighbors.

The owners of the property where the crater was found were generally more concerned with property damage by possible trespassers over the place than with making any sort of a profit or gaining fame by the report of the crater. This is usually not the case in a hoax.

The clearing itself was just a small opening between the trees, approximately 25 feet across. No trees lines, with the exception of the broken trees, protruded from above into the clearing, but rather extended just to its edge.
