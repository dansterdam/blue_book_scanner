The image does not contain a photograph, it is a handwritten document. I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

"met a house about 6 miles
straight to the west and
stopped the watch it. we
watched it for some time,
about 3 to 4 minutes. It
moved to the opposite side of us, about
a quarter of a mile and then
shot straight up. We watched it
till it went out of sight.

The object was about 30 feet in
diameter and seemed to be some
type of aircraft with a brilliant white
light in the center. It made no noise
whatsoever. When it shot straight up,
it gathered speed very rapidly and
was out of sight in a matter of
seconds.

We were in the car with the
motor running and the lights on.
When the object moved to the opposite
side, it cast a light on the ground
around our car like moonlight. No
other aircraft were visible and the
night was clear and still.

Please forward this to Blue Book.
