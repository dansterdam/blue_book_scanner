Arvada Police Capture UFO - A Bulky Balloon
Arvada police captured an unidentified flying object falling through the air sky. It was placed in the air by pranksters earlier in the evening, according to officers, and calls to the Rocky Mountain News resulted in its discovery. It turned out to be a a large plastic balloon, about 100 pounds, floating eastward slowly and visible from three miles, emitting no sound.
First sighting of the object came to the Arvada Police Department at 8:38 p.m. Residents reported seeing flares turned out and the elongated UFO fall to the ground in a churchyard at W 62nd Ave and Carr St., where it was recovered by Arvada Patrolmen Daniel E. Bradley.
First sign of the balloon's recovery was at 8:55 p.m., bringing added excitement that it had exploded. Officers said the balloon, which appeared to have been made of plastic material inflated to gigantic size, measured about eight feet in diameter and was constructed with a wire mesh.
UFO sightings have been reported for a week in the Denver area, most originating in the Golden and Lakewood areas.
