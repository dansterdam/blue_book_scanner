SATELLITE (Echo II) passed over 95^-40N at 1100Z on a southerly heading.
Observer watched a star like object, push-white in color, travel across the sky. The object appeared to be at about jet aircraft altitude. The sky was clear and the entire observation lasted for about 3 minutes. The factor that observer notes was that the object made a left and then a right turn during the flight path.
The description is consistent with that of a satellite observation. Echo II was over the area and should have been visible to the observer.
