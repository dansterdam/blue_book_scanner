APRIL 24, 1964, Socorro, New Mexico
On April 24, 1964, at approximately 5:45 P.M., New Mexico State Police, Mr. Lonnie Zamora, reported an object on the ground a mile south of town, down at the arroyo. Lonnie Zamora said the object was white, egg-shaped and supported off the ground on legs. He saw smoke and flames coming from underneath the object. The noise was similar to a roar and the object rose rapidly, accelerated and took off in a southwesterly direction. Zamora said it was about 50 feet long and about 15 feet wide.
The Air Force sent investigators from the Holloman Air Development Center. The investigation disclosed the following facts: No other witnesses to the object could be identified. There were no helicopter or aircraft in the area. Observers at radar installations observed no unusual or unidentified blips. There was no unusual meteorological activity. There were no signs of markings of any kind in the area other than the shallow depressions at the landing site. Laboratory analysis of the burned brush showed no chemical traces which would indicate a type of propellant. The Air Force continues its investigation and the case is still open.
