The image appears to be a handwritten document page, but there is no photograph present. I will proceed to extract the text from the document:

I felt - and in relation to this area - that the weather was very clear - and that these were probably - of a highly explainable nature. If any of you could give me some idea of what - and when - this happened - it would be of tremendous assistance. I realize, of course, that you cannot identify me in any way - but any clues or suggestions would be most welcome. We hope with your help to investigate this fully - and to arrive at some intelligent conclusion. If you have any other such reports from this general area, we would be most anxious to have them. Please let me know whatever you can, and many thanks for your co-operation.
