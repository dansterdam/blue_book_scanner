"At 2:30 a.m., May 13, 1964, the sky near Wheaton, Maryland was illuminated by a bright oval-shaped object surrounded by a bluish glow. The object was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter and was hovering about 150 feet above the ground. It remained in view for about 10 minutes and then shot straight up at a tremendous speed and disappeared. There were no sound effects. The event was observed by two witnesses and reported to the authorities."
