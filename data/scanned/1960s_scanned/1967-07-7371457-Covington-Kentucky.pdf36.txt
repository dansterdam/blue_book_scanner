Dear Sirs:
On Aug. 19, 1967, my cousin and I saw a bright red light moving in the sky about 10:40 p.m. CST. It seemed to be coming from the direction of the Covington area across the Ohio River and was traveling in a northeasterly direction. The light became bright and then dimmed several times during the approximately 2 to 3 minutes that we observed it. When the light finally dimmed out of sight, there was no sound and no trail. We believe it may have been an aircraft or a satellite, but it moved much more rapidly than any aircraft we have ever seen. If any additional information is required, please let me know.
Sincerely yours,
