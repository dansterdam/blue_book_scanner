11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The object sighted for the last three weeks between 2130 and 2145 hours was described as the size of the moon, very bright, not as bright as the stars. Sometimes appears to be going straight, sometimes appears to be going slightly southward. Only observed and off so witness pucked out on an airplane. Info to witness date quite sketchy, therefore info was sent.
