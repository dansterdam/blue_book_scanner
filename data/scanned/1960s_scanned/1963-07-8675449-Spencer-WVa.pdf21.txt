and had to make 
landing

was Staff Reporter

ST. Sgt. Randall, a
resident of Waynesburg,
Pa., told a UPI reporter here
that the object, which he said
was "peaceful" and "very,
very bright", came from the
south at about 8:10 p.m. EST.
Randall said he was driving
home from work when he saw
the object and stopped his car
to watch it.

He said the object came down
from a great height, hovering
for a few seconds and then
landing about 500 yards away
on a hillside. Randall said he
attempted to get a closer look
but the object took off again
and disappeared over a hill.

S. Sgt. James Koehl, stationed
at the Langley Air Force
Base near Newport News, Va.,
was a passenger in Randall's
car. Koehl is quoted as
saying he also saw the object.
