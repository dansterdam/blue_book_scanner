There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The text in the document is as follows:

   IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN ESTIMATE OF THE DISTANCE OF OBJECT, PLEASE INDICATE THE APPARENT 
   SIZE OF OBJECT IN RELATION TO THE FOLLOWING:
   AN OBJECT 6 INCHES IN DIAMETER WOULD APPEAR TO BE:
   AT 1 MILES: PERIOD AT END OF SENTENCE
   AT 4 MILES: SMALL TYPE ON COIN
   AT 10 MILES: HEAD OF PENCIL

WHEN THIS OBJECT FIRST CAME INTO SIGHT, IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PERIOD AT THE END OF THIS SENTENCE. IT GREW TO ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SILVER DOLLAR AS IT CAME CLOSER. THEN IT SUDDENLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT IN ABOUT 4 OR 5 SECONDS. WHATEVER IT WAS IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SOUND. I DON'T RECALL ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT ITS SHAPE OR COLOR EXCEPT THAT IT SEEMED METALLIC AND DULL IN APPEARANCE. THERE WERE NO LIGHTS ON IT THAT I COULD SEE. I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY EFFECT ON MYSELF AS IT WENT OVER.

There is no further text beyond this in the document.
