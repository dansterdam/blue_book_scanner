Dear Sir:

My husband and I, also, several people around where we were sitting watching, saw five lights in the sky. There were five or six of them and they appeared to be stationary for about 15 minutes. Then all of a sudden they disappeared. We were not sure this was not just some trick lights or planes maneuvering alone the beach then all of a sudden they disappeared shortly after.

This is what we saw.
