Text from the document:

There days after this experience I notified officials on the flying saucers. It stated that scientists at two Antarctica bases verified a saucer - shaped object in the sky which maneuvers were very similar to the onewe saw. These officials say it confirm that we were obeject correct in our observation. 

These officials saw it on Saturday July 3rd. We saw it on Sunday July 4th. Scientific officials verified the story and stated that there scientists were present at these bases.  

I mail it back to me with your reply, because I would like to have it. We would appreciate it if you would write back and comment on this and give us all the information possible on the subject.

Thank you
Sincerly yours
