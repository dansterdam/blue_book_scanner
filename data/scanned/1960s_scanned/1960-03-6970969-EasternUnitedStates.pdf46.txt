Agencies in Disagreement
On Mystery Lights
This case illustrates the disagreement that can exist between various agencies and scientific groups concerning the interpretation of unidentified flying objects or "mystery lights". 
A report was received from observers in a aircraft over the eastern United States. The observers reported seeing an intense lighted object at 30,000 feet altitude apparently hovering in the air motionless for approximately 20 minutes. The object was described as being about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and emitting a bright glowing light. After the initial 20 minute period, the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight at a very high rate of speed.
The report was forwarded to the U.S. Air Force who investigated the incident. The Air Force concluded that the object was a meteor or bolide (fireball), even though the object was reported to be hovering motionless for an extended period of time. This interpretation was apparently based on the intense light and sudden acceleration and disappearance of the object.
However, certain astronomical groups disagreed with the Air Force interpretation. These groups felt that the observed behavior - a motionless hovering for 20 minutes - was not characteristic of a meteor or fireball, and that the observations indicated the presence of some type of structured, intelligently controlled aircraft.
This illustrates the type of disagreement that can arise between various agencies and scientific groups concerning the interpretation of unusual aerial phenomena. Reasonable people can disagree on the explanation of a particular sighting, especially when the reported behavior does not fit neatly into any conventional category of explanation.
