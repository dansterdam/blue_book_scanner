Mystifying Flying Object Is Sighted 

Unusual Marks Found

The man in the street was mystified and officials began "investigating" today following reports of the landing of an unidentified flying object on the outskirts of Socorro Friday afternoon and the sighting of a strange craft, said to be "shiny and brightly shaped."

Sgt. Zamora, told of seeing the egg-shaped vehicle, roughly the size of an automobile, which landed a flash in the southwest sky about 5 p.m. Friday while on routine patrol.

He said he got within about 100 yards of the strange craft, saw two "men" adjacent to it, and hurried away when the object took off with a roar and a burst of flame.

Reports of the incident poured in from Stallion Gate, Stallion Site and State Police headquarters. A report to State Police here Saturday at 6 p.m. by Sgt. Zamora stated that the "object" had been seen to go down in the vicinity of State Highway 85, some 12 miles from Socorro. He stated no particular search of the area was made. It was not clear what, if any, evidence of the incident had been gathered.
