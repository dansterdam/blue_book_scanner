1. Your wife, who was an eyewitness, was contacted on 21 December 1967 concerning the UFO observation. She stated that both were observing stars when suddenly a bright object appeared in the north which was bluish-white in color and seemed to move rapidly in an erratic manner. It remained in view for about 10-15 seconds and then disappeared.

2. There were no unusual incidents reported by radar observers at the Syracuse Defense Center.
