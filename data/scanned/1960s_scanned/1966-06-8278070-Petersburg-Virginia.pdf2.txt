I was looking out the back door of my home at the sky and noticed a large orange object moving toward me. The object appeared to be approximately 75 feet in size with a white light around the edges. As it went over me, I noticed it had no visible airplane type wings or tail and seemed to be moving silently. As it moved to the southeast, it began to fade from view and looked like a star becoming smaller in the distance. The entire sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds.
