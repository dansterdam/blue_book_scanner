Lima, Peru

At 3 a.m. in the morning of the 27th at Lima, Peru, Mr. Prosper Alva, an employee of the Citizen Electric Company, observed a strange object in the sky which made a noise which sounded like "bubbles and bumble bees". It was inside a building and looked out a window. The object was about four meters in diameter, round and shaped like a tank, with holes all over it. Mr. Alva got the impression that the revolving arms was some sort of scanning device. The object was on the ground about 1.5 meters from Alva's position. After a while, the object moved slowly and silently to the right, then came up moving rapidly, and after hovering at great speed it disappeared into the night sky.
