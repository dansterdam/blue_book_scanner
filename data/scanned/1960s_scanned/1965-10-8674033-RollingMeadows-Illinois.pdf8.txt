The image contains a photograph that appears to be a simple sketch or drawing. The drawing depicts two circular objects with the text "STARTING STILL" and an arrow pointing upwards.

Below is the text transcribed from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? NO

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

15. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: 
a. Sound NOISE
b. Color WITH THE SUN REFLECTING ON IT, IT LOOKED WHITE. ELLOGY

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please on arrow inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
