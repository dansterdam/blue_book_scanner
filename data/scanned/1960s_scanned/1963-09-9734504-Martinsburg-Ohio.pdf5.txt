October 14, 1963

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your letter of September 24, 1963 reporting sighting unidentified objects during the early morning of the 21st.

When the report was received, it was immediately forwarded to the proper Air Force agencies for analysis. Mission which might have been conducted in that general area at that time could not be confirmed with the information provided. The witnesses states that the objects appeared to be metallic and capable of performing acrobatic maneuvers which could not be accomplished by any known conventional aircraft.

Since there are no many solventris and technical considerations involved in each sighting, thorough visual and technical examinations are conducted on each incident. This is done as part of the Air Force program to identify the cause of such phenomena.

Thank you for reporting this incident to the Air Force. We are sorry we are unable to advise you further as to the source of the lights.

Sincerely,

MASON M. JACKS 
Major, USAF
Public Information Division

Martinsburg, Ohio
