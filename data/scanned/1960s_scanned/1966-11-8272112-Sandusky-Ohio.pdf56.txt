The image appears to contain a diagram and instructions rather than a photograph. The diagram shows a compass with curved lines indicating the direction of movement of an unspecified object. The instructions below the diagram ask the reader to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects and indicate the direction they were traveling if there was more than one object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where the object was when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where the object first appeared, and a "B" on the compass to show where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
