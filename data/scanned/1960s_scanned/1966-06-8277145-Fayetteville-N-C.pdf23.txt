14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
5 sightings; each time the UFO followed a straight course and then disappeared.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes No (Don't Know) If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: Disappeared could have been due to clouds, but don't think so.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - NO
b. Color - Yellow, similar to a star.

18. We wish to know the angular size: Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
Covered completely by a match head at arm's length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object they you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
