Dear Sir,

I just sighted a bright light at approximately 3:45 A.M. EST over Tolland, Mass. It was a high altitude object, very bright and moved at a high rate of speed, disappearing into the west. It was visible for approximately 2 minutes. This was not a plane or any known aircraft. I am reporting this in the hope that you will investigate this incident. Please let me know if you require any further information.

Sincerely,
