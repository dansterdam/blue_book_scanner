The image contains three sketches or illustrations. The first sketch appears to show a curved line with an object above the horizon. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road in a rural or suburban setting. The third sketch shows a smaller version of the second sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch to show an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
