That he was able to devote full attention to the sighting, viewing it in relatively open country, lends support to the hypothesis that the object did not land, but hovered up in the atmosphere, as he reported. Further, the absence of noise, reported by all observed, suggests that the distance to the object, as far as known, was considerably in excess of the speed of sound to the area. The continuous duration of sightings was also noted.

5. Evaluation:
a. It is the preparing officer's opinion that, based upon analysis of the witnesses' reports, the object seen was probably a meteorite of unusual brilliance which probably burned up completely in the atmosphere, but possibly could have landed considerably to the SW of Wichita Falls, perhaps in the vicinity of the Texas/New Mexico border.
b. The material recovered by the Wichita Falls housewife and attached to this report can only be given a tentative evaluation. Possibly floating spider web material. It is felt that the material recovered bears no connection to the meteorite sighted earlier in the morning.
