NEW PATROLMAN REPORTS MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS
Patrolman Lonnie Zamora, who interrupted his patrol shortly after 5:45 p.m. on April 24, 1964 to investigate what he thought was a car that had rolled off the road into a canyon near Socorro, New Mexico, said he came upon a strange sight that close to his life. 
The object Zamora saw, about the size of a car, was suspended about 3 feet off the ground, hovering over the desert area. It appeared to be occupied. It was low-slung, about 15 feet in length, and had a shiny, aluminum-color surface. As Zamora approached it, the object rose vertically and made a roaring sound like a jet. Within seconds, it had disappeared from sight, leaving deep impressions in the desert soil where it had been resting.
Zamora claims that he saw two persons, about 5 feet tall, near the object, and as it rose in the air, a red emblem "like a Devil's Trident" appeared on the side. The object itself had no wheels, ports, or landing gear. Another strange report donates the presence of some object, possible a UFO, which was sighted over the Canyon Ferry Reservoir near Helena, Montana, on April 15, 1964.
