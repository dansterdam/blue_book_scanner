There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

I am convinced that there are flying saucers, either from our Planet, being secret or experimental planes, tested by our government or a foreign country.

If these new aircraft are our own then we have nothing to fear from them. If on the other hand they are from a foreign power or another Planet, then it is a got for your Boys to keep right on top of them, I hope you don't think I am a kook or nut, I am just telling you what I saw two years ago. I hope one case can deceive you. I am just telling you what I saw.
Yours sincerely
