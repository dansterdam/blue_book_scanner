TARGET: CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR WHY THE FPS-20 HEIGHT FINDER WAS UNABLE TO PAINT THE TARGET. BACK LV. (CONTACT WITH LT/COL JAMES 0. PAYNE, ATIC, REVEALED THAT NO SIMILAR OPERATION COULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SIGHTING AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIMILAR INCIDENTS DURING SUBSEQUENT TESTS.
PART V. IT IS CONCLUDED BY ATIC THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED ON RADAR AT CAPE CANAVERAL ON 11 APR 61 AT 1457Z WAS PROBABLY A REAL TARGET, FLYING AT AN ALTITUDE OF NO MORE THAN 35,000 FEET. NO DEFINITE EXPLANATION OF WHY THE TARGET DID NOT APPEAR ON THE FPS-20 CAN BE REACHED, BUT INSPECTION OF THE SITE AND THE RADAR MAINTENANCE RECORD WOULD REVEAL IF THIS WAS DUE TO A DEAD AREA OF FAULTY EQUIPMENT.
