Dear Allen:

I thank you so much for your review of our book. I am sure that your review will do the impression a lot of good. However, I am wondering if the difficulties you mention with respect to the interpretation of my earlier book did not incidentally cause you to make a hoax or perhaps some sort of hallucination. If the difficulties have truly been removed, however, I am glad that you have been able to give us an open pronouncement of it, as this is quite satisfactory.

I am considering a meeting of the IAU. You missed a personal session which I had arranged especially for dealing with claims made to me like the encounters above. I shall plan to attend the executive committee meeting in Delhi which you tell me is scheduled for October. Please send a very interesting program suggesting a dealing with the encounters.

Cordially yours,
Donald H. Menzel
