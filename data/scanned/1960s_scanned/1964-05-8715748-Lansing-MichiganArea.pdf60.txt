One of the calls associated with the night of the emergency run previously mentioned was from a farmer in Grand Ledge, who called the fire department with a report that he had seen a flying object land and take off again.
A police car 9 miles from the scene was dispatched, but before it arrived the farmer, whose name was not obtained, said that the object was gone; the investigating patrol reported sighting nothing unusual, so the sighting was not logged in the police report.
The farmer said the object was difficult to describe. The police officer clearly believes the man to be "mistaken".
There are several more reports which need to be straightened out better than I could do over the telephone.

At _________, the wife jumped out of bed, terrified, the sound having awakened her. Between these calls to the sheriff's office and Michigan State Police were received, and I received an unsolicited call from a reporter, Dick Frasier of the Lansing State Journal, who was trying to find out if my calls of the night before were legitimate, and who had another report which came in just after I had made contact with _________.
A Miss _________, in Lansing, saw three objects as 9:00, 9:45, and 11:00 PM on the 20th, at least one of which showed shape (outlines), not point source) and which she observed through binoculars. Her husband also saw the objects and shared what he observed.
