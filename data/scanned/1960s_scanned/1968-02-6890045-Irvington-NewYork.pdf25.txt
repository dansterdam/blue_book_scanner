I heard of the incident three days after it took place. My investigation began on Wednesday, February 21 with an interview of Officer Hollis in his office on Vashon Island. The following Saturday, February 24, was spent gathering the remainder of the material found in this report.

Soil and water samples were sent to the King County Sheriff's Crime Laboratory in Seattle. I contacted them this morning to determine if any interesting results had been found in the course of analyzing the samples. He reported that an analysis had not been performed, because of the heavy work load of the laboratory. He said that I could pick up the samples tomorrow if I wanted them. His only request was that I furnish him with a copy of the report made to APRO. These samples should be in the mail to you tomorrow afternoon.

Despite the fact that several discrepancies exist in the stories of the witnesses who saw the object, I believe that they were telling the truth as they saw it. For example, one witness, whose name was necessarily blent out in this report, was noticeably upset while recounting the incident. At one point, during the interview, the same witness displayed a type of uneasiness which he displayed would have been difficult to fake.

Another puzzling aspect of the incident is the formation of the ice. It is extremely unlikely, on the basis of weather reports and the testimony of witnesses, that it was cold enough to freeze the water in the pond to a two-inch thick, solid mass (witnesses reported that large rocks thrown to the center of the pond bounced on the ice.).

The possibility of a prank is unlikely because of the size of the affected area. A prankster would have had to go to a tremendous amount of trouble and expense to pull off such a joke. What kind of a motive would he have?
