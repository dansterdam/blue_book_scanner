UFO SIGHTING REPORT

1. PERSONAL ACCOUNT

In your own words, please describe the incident as it happened. (If additional pages are used, they are numbered.)

The sky was hazy and a yellowish color. I saw what appeared to be a u.f.o. rise up from the horizon and move up and take an arc. It seemed to be two yellowish-white lights and two years ago I saw something similar in same general area. The object was flat across the top was circular and was extremely fast. I watched it with the red green while (prominent)
it seemed to lose altitude and went out of sight northwest. This lasted for quite a few minutes observation and there were no other like it in the sky at that time.
