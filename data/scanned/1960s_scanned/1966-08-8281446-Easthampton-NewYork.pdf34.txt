The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be two unidentified flying objects or UFOs. The sketch is accompanied by a report or questionnaire related to the observation of these objects.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
"yes, it went up with a puff of white smoke"

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One) Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) Yes No Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - none
b. Color - Tan or pink, had a pulsating light

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match stick. This will give us an experiment of the time of the object.
"was drawing at least 1/4 the size of it and i/4 mingle the sun appeared 2 fast moving circles with no sound."

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object they you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and specifically show the direction the object was moving.
