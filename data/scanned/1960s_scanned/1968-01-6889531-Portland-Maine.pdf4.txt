Transcribing the text from the image:

Dear Sir,
I have seen an object light up at about 7:30 p.m. the object moving saying about 5 to 10 minutes, it was on about the size of a basketball, going faster than an airplane, about the size of a small object idling near the ground. It was moving to the north slowly, about 150 to 300 feet. It was making a noise like a motor running. It was incredible to me. At first it looked like a star or something, but it was moving at a slow speed. About 150 to 300 feet up. It was real.
