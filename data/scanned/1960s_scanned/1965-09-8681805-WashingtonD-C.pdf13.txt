The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an object or objects in the sky. The sketch includes angular lines, what appears to be a compass rose or similar directional indicator, and other artistic elements.

The text output from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the survey where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the survey where the object was below the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" on the start of the path, and show any changes in direction during the sighting.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were moving.
