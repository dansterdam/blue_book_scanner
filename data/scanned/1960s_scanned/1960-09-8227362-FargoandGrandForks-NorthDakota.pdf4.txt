PAGE THREE RJEEAF 9
URYS APS, GRAND FORKS AFB, N.D. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THIS
BSERVATION INDICATES THE SIGHTING WAS PROBABLY AN UNUSUALLY LARGE
ETEOR OR SIMILAR ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENA, HOWEVER, THE POSSIBILITY
XISTS THAT THE SIGHTED OBJECT MAY SUBSTANTIALLY BE IDENTIFIED AS A
OON DUST SIGHTING. IN ADDITION TO THE OBSERVERS NOIED IN THIS
EPORT, NUMEROUS UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS ALLEGED TO HAVE SEEN THIS
BJECT FROM THE GROUND. VARIOUS CIVIL AND AIRCRAFT LANDING AT HECTOR
TPORT, FARGO, N.D., REPORTED SEEING THIS OBJECT AT VARIOUS POINTS
MUCH AS 150 MILES NORTH AND SOUTH FROM FARGO, N.D. INCOMPLETE
NVESTIGATION ALSO INDICATES THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED AT PRINCIPAL
EPORT, DULUTH, MINN. AND BY THE US COAST GUARD OFF THE
ASTERN SHORE OF LAKE SUPERIOR. ALL THESE SOURCES, AS FAR AS
E DETERMINED, AGREE IN TIME AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION WITH THE
BSERVERS IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT.
