Gentlemen:
I am writing to you in the hopes that the following U.F.O.'s can be analyzed. Once the objects are determined definite identification is required at this time.

1. Sightings: 1.) At about 5:00 p.m. on the afternoon of Dec. 5, 1965, a huge delta shaped object, 40-50 feet in diameter, traveling at an estimated speed of about 600-750 m.p.h., appeared, hovered, and started on a westerly course. It was observed for at least 15 minutes, later an smaller craft left the larger object and flew an angular path to the west. Both objects disappeared in the distance.
2.) At approximately 10:58p.m. on the night of July 8, 1966, a tear shaped object, 75-80 feet long and 35 miles high and traveling at a speed of at least 30,000 m.p.h. was observed for about 25-30 seconds. The object was illuminated and appeared to accelerate rapidly as it moved from the north to the south in a straight line. During this time of its appearance, excluding the moon, it was observed by 3 witnesses as it maneuvered in the sky.
