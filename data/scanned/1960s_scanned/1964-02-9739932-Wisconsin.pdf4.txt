On February 19, 1964
Dayton, Ohio

Dear sir,

I have made out a report concerning a sighting I had of a mysterious object in the sky over Dayton, Ohio.

On the evening of February 15, 1964, at approximately 6:45 p.m. while returning home from work, I observed a very bright, unusual light in the sky. This object seemed to be hovering and stationary. As I watched it, the object suddenly shot off at a tremendous rate of speed towards the northeast, disappearing in just a few seconds. The object did not appear to have any definite shape or form and there was no sound associated with it. Because it was so unusual and unidentified, I felt it should be reported.

Sincerely,
