RE: Unidentified Flying object.

Dear Sirs:

This letter is to report a phenomenon observed on the night of November 1, 1961, at Diboll, Texas. It was originally thought to be a satellite, was seen in the western sky at an angle of 70 to 80 degrees. This was observed for several minutes traveling in a northerly direction and have been dismissed as a satellite, if when it was in the northern sky at an angle of 15 degrees, it suddenly disappeared at 8:05 P.M. CST and was not seen again.

The object could not be distinguished from a star of 2nd degree magnitude except by it's motion.

Respectively submitted,
