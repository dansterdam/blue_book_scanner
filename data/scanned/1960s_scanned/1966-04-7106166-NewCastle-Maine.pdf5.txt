The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document or report related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page provides instructions for a sketch or drawing related to the observation of an object in the sky. It asks the reader to imagine they are at a certain point, place markers on a curved line to show the object's position above the horizon, and then draw a picture to show the motion of the object. The page also contains a compass rose diagram and handwritten notes.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object were above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw it.
90°
75°
60° One space there
45° + drifts
30° westward
North
South

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then please give the details here as to how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
