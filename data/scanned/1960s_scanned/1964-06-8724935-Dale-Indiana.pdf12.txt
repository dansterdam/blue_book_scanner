Information Onlys American UFO Committee Review, Vol 1, No 2, Sep 64

On 12 Aug 1964, Dale, Indiana: About 9 p.m. CHARLES SIZEMORE, 31, watched objects in the sky which seemed to be as far from each other as his house and the end of the next block. They appeared to be traveling at high altitudes above clouds, and were seen independently and in pairs. They made no sound, and appeared and disappeared intermittently. His daughter and her husband, who were with him, also observed the objects. Several other neighbors also witnessed the phenomenon. Sizemore said he did not see any distinguishing features such as lights or markings, and was unable to estimate the size or distance of the objects. However, he said they seemed to be a problem to the eye, being somewhat hazy or indistinct, as though affected by diffraction. No physical evidence was found. Sizemore is a graduate of Purdue University and is employed as a computer programmer. He impressed the investigators as being a reliable, intelligent observer. The objects were among the physical evidence here.
